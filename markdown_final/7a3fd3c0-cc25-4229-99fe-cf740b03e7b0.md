Sepsis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sepsis recognition and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern definition and diagnostic framework to anchor recognition. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities and timing. Next, I will review antimicrobial strategy, including timing, spectrum, and stewardship. After that, I need to examine hemodynamic resuscitation, vasopressors, and source control. Finally, I should consider special populations, ongoing care and de-escalation, and quality improvement and controversies, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized by an acute increase in SOFA score of 2 points or more, and septic shock as a subset with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities associated with higher mortality, often reflected by lactate above 4 mmol/L and vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Wait, I should verify the screening tool outside the ICU: qSOFA (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, or systolic BP ≤ 100 mmHg) is intended for rapid risk stratification, not diagnosis, and should prompt closer evaluation rather than be used as a standalone diagnostic criterion.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about presentation. Sepsis is a clinical syndrome with variable manifestations; fever is common but not universal, and older adults or immunocompromised patients may present subtly, so I need to ensure I'm integrating vitals, exam, and labs rather than relying on a single sign or biomarker [^114nkjGV]. I should double-check that the initial evaluation includes cultures, targeted imaging, lactate, and baseline labs, while remembering that sepsis is a clinical diagnosis and a specific pathogen is not required to meet criteria [^114nkjGV] [^1115wEis].

> Next, I should review timing and the initial assessment. I need to ensure that for suspected sepsis or septic shock, treatment and resuscitation begin immediately, with a strong recommendation to start broad-spectrum antimicrobials ideally within 1 hour of recognition, especially in shock, and to obtain blood cultures before antibiotics if this does not cause a clinically meaningful delay, typically less than 45 minutes [^117TtP7Y] [^111U7vcz]. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, I should confirm that a rapid assessment of infectious versus noninfectious causes is completed within about 3 hours, and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be given within that window, balancing the risk of delay against the risk of overtreatment [^1159AV5J] [^1111oLvH].

> I will now examine antimicrobial selection and stewardship, but wait, I should verify the nuances. Empiric therapy should be tailored to the likely source, local epidemiology, and patient-specific risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms; in high-risk patients, two gram-negative agents may be reasonable initially, whereas in low-risk patients, a single gram-negative agent is preferred, and all combination therapy should be de-escalated promptly once susceptibilities return [^114jogr7] [^111W8GHj]. I need to ensure daily reassessment for de-escalation and to consider shorter courses when source control is adequate, with procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to support discontinuation decisions when duration is uncertain, recognizing the evidence quality is low but directionally supportive of reducing exposure [^114NZQDr] [^1122xiuH] [^113JyKUf].

> Let me think about hemodynamic resuscitation next. I should confirm that crystalloids are first-line, with an initial 30 mL/kg bolus within the first 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, while using dynamic measures to guide further fluids and reassessing frequently to avoid both under- and over-resuscitation [^1164Az2o] [^112px7aN]. Hold on, I should verify the role of albumin: it can be considered when substantial crystalloid has been given and hypotension persists, but hetastarch should be avoided due to harm, and balanced crystalloids may be preferable to saline when available [^114zHw6V] [^1142X2co].

> Next, I should review vasopressor strategy and targets. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg; if MAP remains inadequate, vasopressin can be added to reduce norepinephrine dose, and epinephrine is reasonable if additional support is needed, while dopamine is generally discouraged outside select scenarios [^114zHw6V]. I need to ensure I'm not overcorrecting MAP in vulnerable patients; a target of 65 mmHg is generally appropriate, with individualization for chronic hypertension or cerebrovascular disease when supported by clinical context [^112px7aN].

> I should confirm the approach to source control because missing this step undermines antibiotics. Source control should be pursued as soon as medically and logistically feasible, ideally within 6–12 hours, using the least invasive effective method; open surgery is reserved for cases where percutaneous or endoscopic options are inadequate or not timely, and prolonged stabilization without source control is discouraged in severe cases [^114tWm4Z] [^114WmUw9]. But wait, what if the source is unclear? In that case, I need to ensure rapid imaging and early consultation to localize and intervene expediently [^114zHw6V].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't apply a one-size-fits-all approach. In pediatrics, antimicrobials should be given as soon as possible in shock, ideally within 1 hour, while allowing up to 3 hours for diagnostic evaluation in nonshock sepsis; fluid resuscitation uses 20 mL/kg boluses and inotropes are more commonly needed for low cardiac output states [^113UNew4]. In pregnancy, physiologic changes can mask sepsis; early recognition, 1-hour antibiotics, and multidisciplinary care are critical, with heightened vigilance for maternal-fetal complications [^112y9Acr]. In older adults, atypical presentations are common, so I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate and treat while screening for functional decline and geriatric syndromes during recovery [^112KV6nH].

> Next, I should review ongoing care and de-escalation to avoid therapeutic inertia. Daily reassessment of antibiotics with de-escalation as soon as clinically and microbiologically justified reduces resistance and toxicity; shorter courses are reasonable with adequate source control, and procalcitonin can support discontinuation decisions when duration is uncertain, though clinical judgment remains paramount [^114NZQDr] [^1122xiuH] [^113JyKUf]. I need to ensure supportive care elements are addressed: lung-protective ventilation for ARDS, glucose control with targets around 140–180 mg/dL, VTE and stress ulcer prophylaxis, and early enteral nutrition when feasible, all aligned with guideline-based bundles [^114zHw6V].

> Hold on, I should verify the quality improvement and systems context because outcomes hinge on process. Implementation of sepsis bundles and protocols improves mortality and time-to-treatment metrics, and the Sepsis Chain of Survival framework emphasizes public awareness, provider training, standardized protocols, and continuous audit to close gaps in care across settings [^111UgGx4]. I should double-check that local pathways include prehospital recognition, ED screening, and rapid response activation to sustain these gains [^111UgGx4].

> But wait, what about controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. The 1-hour antibiotic mandate has been criticized for driving overtreatment in possible sepsis without shock; IDSA recommends limiting mandatory time targets to septic shock and allowing clinician discretion in nonshock presentations to balance stewardship and diagnostic uncertainty, which I should acknowledge in shared decision-making and documentation [^116Nh8HK] [^116tRBaf]. Fluid strategy after the initial 30 mL/kg remains debated, with no clear superiority of restrictive versus liberal approaches in the first 24 hours; individualized reassessment with dynamic parameters is prudent, and ongoing research aims to refine phenotypes and personalize resuscitation [^1114EULe] [^116JnXM9]. I should also note that Sepsis-3 has been critiqued for potentially missing early infection before organ dysfunction, reinforcing the need for clinical vigilance and iterative reassessment rather than rigid score thresholds [^1148pq6L].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, time-sensitive approach: recognize sepsis early using SOFA/qSOFA as adjuncts to clinical judgment, start broad-spectrum antimicrobials within 1 hour for shock and within 3 hours for high-likelihood infection without shock, obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible, give 30 mL/kg crystalloid promptly with dynamic-guided reassessment, initiate norepinephrine for persistent hypotension, secure source control urgently, tailor therapy to special populations, and de-escalate antibiotics daily with shorter courses when appropriate, all embedded within system-level bundles and continuous quality improvement [^117TtP7Y] [^111U7vcz] [^1164Az2o] [^114zHw6V] [^114tWm4Z] [^114NZQDr] [^111UgGx4].

---

Sepsis is a **life-threatening organ dysfunction** from a dysregulated host response to infection [^1155TWWm], with high mortality and substantial long-term morbidity [^112onkXQ]. Early recognition using SOFA/qSOFA and prompt management are critical: give **30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours** [^1164Az2o] and start **broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** when shock is present or infection is likely [^117TtP7Y] [^111dAe5q]. Add vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^112px7aN], pursue rapid source control [^114WmUw9], and tailor therapy with daily reassessment and de-escalation [^114NZQDr]. Mortality rises with each hour of delay [^1115sEoR], so **time-sensitive, protocolized care** is essential [^111UgGx4].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

Sepsis is **life-threatening organ dysfunction** caused by a dysregulated host response to infection [^114nkjGV], operationalized by an acute increase in SOFA score ≥ 2 points [^notfound]. Septic shock is a subset with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction [^114nkjGV] and is associated with higher mortality [^114nkjGV].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Sepsis presents with **nonspecific signs** — fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mental status, and hypotension [^114nkjGV] — and may be subtle in older adults or the immunocompromised [^114nkjGV]. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion plus infection evidence, with SOFA/qSOFA aiding early identification of organ dysfunction [^1155TWWm] [^114nkjGV].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

- **Vital signs and physical examination**: Identify instability and potential infection sources [^113nCftv].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, lactate, renal and hepatic panels, coagulation profile, and inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) [^114nkjGV].
- **Microbiological cultures**: Blood (ideally before antibiotics if delay ≤ 45 min) [^111U7vcz], urine, sputum, and other relevant sites [^114sswqQ].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, CT, or ultrasound to identify infection sources [^114zHw6V].

---

## Early management and treatment

### Fluid resuscitation

Use **crystalloids as first-line fluids** [^112px7aN]; balanced solutions (e.g. lactated Ringer's) are preferred over saline when available [^112px7aN]. Administer at least 30 mL/kg within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock [^1164Az2o] [^114Bsy8f]. Use dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) to guide further fluids [^112px7aN] [^1164Az2o].

---

### Antimicrobial therapy

Start **broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** of recognition when septic shock is present or infection is likely [^111dAe5q] [^117TtP7Y]. Tailor empiric therapy to the likely source, local resistance patterns, and patient risk factors [^111W8GHj] [^114h6N1R]. Reassess daily and de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response [^114NZQDr].

---

### Vasopressor support

Use **norepinephrine as first-line** to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^114zHw6V]. Add vasopressin if MAP remains inadequate, and consider epinephrine or vasopressin if norepinephrine is insufficient [^114zHw6V].

---

### Source control

Identify and intervene **urgently** — drain abscesses, remove infected devices, or perform surgery — as soon as feasible [^114WmUw9] [^114tWm4Z].

---

## Monitoring and supportive care

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Continuous arterial and central venous pressure monitoring as indicated [^notfound].
- **Respiratory support**: Oxygenation and ventilatory support for respiratory failure [^114zHw6V].
- **Renal support**: Renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury [^114zHw6V].
- **Glycemic control**: Target glucose 140–180 mg/dL [^notfound].
- **Thromboprophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis**: As indicated [^114zHw6V].

---

## Complications and long-term outcomes

Complications include **ARDS, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ failure** [^114zHw6V]. Long-term outcomes often involve **chronic critical illness, cognitive impairment, and functional disability** [^114nkjGV].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **infection prevention** — hand hygiene, vaccination, and antimicrobial stewardship [^111xoqnj] — and on **early recognition** through education and training for healthcare providers and the public [^111UgGx4].

---

## Special populations

- **Pediatric patients**: Age-specific resuscitation protocols and antimicrobial dosing [^114qFyMu].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Tailored antimicrobial therapy and vigilant monitoring [^114nkjGV].
- **Elderly patients**: Atypical presentations require heightened suspicion and careful assessment [^112KV6nH].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions include efforts to **identify biomarkers** for early detection and risk stratification [^111j6k7T], development of personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy to individual patient profiles [^111j6k7T], and advancement of digital health technologies, including AI and machine learning, to improve outcomes [^117PhQ3W].

---

Sepsis is a **medical emergency** requiring rapid recognition, early antibiotics, and aggressive supportive care [^111xoqnj]. Early, protocolized management reduces mortality and morbidity, and ongoing research aims to refine definitions, diagnostics, and individualized therapies [^1155TWWm].

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

### Pitfalls in the treatment of sepsis [^111uunSK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a challenging, dynamic, pathophysiology requiring expertise in diagnosis and management. Controversy exists as to the most sensitive early indicators of sepsis and sepsis severity. Patients presenting to the emergency department often lack complete history or clinical data that would point to optimal management. Awareness of these potential knowledge gaps is important for the emergency provider managing the septic patient. Specific areas of management including the initiation and management of mechanical ventilation, the appropriate disposition of the patient, and consideration of transfer to higher levels of care are reviewed.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1155TWWm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the United States each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FI O₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management [^114nkjGV]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

### Management of sepsis in hospitalized patients [^112onkXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is the leading cause of death worldwide. Mortality has improved in the past few decades but remains high, and survivors frequently have long-term complications. Initial diagnostic evaluation focuses on risk stratification and source and pathogen identification. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, vasopressors, steroids if shock is present, antimicrobial therapy targeting the most likely source of infection, and source control. Patients with shock or high-risk organ failure syndromes should be admitted early to an intensive care unit. After initial antimicrobials and resuscitation, care should focus on antimicrobial deescalation, volume management, and high-quality supportive care. Shared decision making about goals of care and transitions is important to support survivors after discharge.

Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao₂/Fio₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department [^111GgLT4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Increased attention has focused recently on the acute management of severe sepsis and septic shock, conditions that represent the end-stage systemic deterioration of overwhelming infection. Clinical trials have identified new therapies and management approaches that, when applied early, appear to reduce mortality. Practice guidelines have been advanced by critical care societies, and many of the proposed interventions involve therapies other than antimicrobials directed at hemodynamic resuscitation or addressing adverse effects of the inflammatory cascade. Although many emergency departments (EDs) are now adopting treatment protocols for sepsis that are based on published treatment guidelines, recent research calls many of the initial recommendations into question, and validation trials of some of these approaches are ongoing. This article reviews the initial evaluation and treatment considerations of sepsis in the ED setting.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial timing: In all patients with potential septic shock, the panel issued a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, and within one hour; for patients with confirmed/very likely sepsis, antimicrobials be administered immediately. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies should be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or deferred while monitoring closely. Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; perform rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness; and administer antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern for infection persists.

Rationale notes that "the initial use of multidrug therapy is often required to ensure the empiric regimen includes at least one effective agent that is active against the offending organism", and that in the empiric phase choice depends on "the local prevalence of resistant organisms, patient risk factors for resistant organisms, and the severity of illness".

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — source control timing and approach in sepsis and septic shock specifies that source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation. Smaller studies suggest that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous, and studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of the limited number of patients and the heterogeneity of the intervention. Any required source control intervention should ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made, and prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. In general, the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control should be pursued; open surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion; surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists; and logistic factors unique to each institution may also play a role in the decision.

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1138QvVG]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### The management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^117V5QDr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^115d89JC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

For children without clinical signs of shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after sepsis recognition, while allowing up to 3 hours for appropriate diagnostic investigation for patients without clinical signs of shock and for those with an uncertain diagnosis. During evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed expeditiously and, if and when the evaluation supports a likely infection or evidence of septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction becomes manifest, antimicrobial therapy should be immediately administered.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Transforming sepsis management: AI-driven innovations in early detection and tailored therapies [^117PhQ3W]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical challenges

Clinical studies have demonstrated higher survival rates of septic shock associated with earlier administration of antibiotics, this emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention to decrease mortality and morbidity. Patient heterogeneity adds to this complexity, with individual responses to infection varying based on genetics and health status. For instance, patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, chronic lung, kidney, or liver diseases, and cancer, as well as individuals at the extremes of age including newborns and the elderly, are more susceptible to severe infections and the development of sepsis. Recent advances in sepsis research underscore the need for molecular stratification of these patients to tailor treatment strategies.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern globally that complicates sepsis treatment. In some countries, the emergence of resistant pathogens has severely limited treatment options, often leaving clinicians with few or no effective therapies. As a result, resistant infections significantly contribute to the mortality burden, accounting for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide annually. Early diagnosis and individualized treatment are essential for improving outcomes, yet current approaches often fail to address the heterogeneity of patient responses.

In 2021, Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine published new guidelines for sepsis management, called The Surviving Sepsis Campaign, offering clinicians state-of-the-art instructions for treating patients with sepsis or septic shock. The guidelines stress the importance of early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after sepsis development. As mentioned before, timely intervention in sepsis care is crucial, as for each hour delay of proper treatment, mortality increases by 7.6% from the onset of hypotension. To this end, early administration of antimicrobials and adequate hemodynamic resuscitation using fluids and vasopressors depending on the patient's needs, ideally within one hour of recognition, is essential for patients with hypotension and sepsis. The sepsis management guidelines recommend early elimination of the infection focus, including empiric administration of a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics and, when necessary, surgical intervention such as incision and drainage of abscesses. It is important to note that samples for microbial analysis should be taken prior to antibiotic administration to increase the diagnostic yield. Additional treatment strategies addressing vascular leakage and endothelial dysfunction are also under investigation to stabilize circulatory collapse in sepsis. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy further complicates management and has been linked to poor outcomes in multiple studies.

### Early recognition and management of sepsis in adults: the first six hours [^112GYmmV]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a complication of severe infection characterized by a systemic inflammatory response. Mortality rates from sepsis range between 25% to 30% for severe sepsis and 40% to 70% for septic shock. The clinical presentation of sepsis is highly variable depending on the etiology. The most common sites of infection are the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal systems, as well as the skin and soft tissue. Fever is often the first manifestation of sepsis, with pneumonia being the most common presentation leading to sepsis. Early goal-directed therapy completed within the first six hours of sepsis recognition significantly decreases in-hospital mortality. Initial management includes respiratory stabilization followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation. Vasopressor therapy is indicated when fluid resuscitation fails to restore adequate mean arterial pressure and organ perfusion. Early antibiotic therapy can improve clinical outcomes, and should be given within one hour of suspected sepsis. Blood product therapy may be required in some cases to correct coagulopathy and anemia, and to improve the central venous oxygen saturation. Insulin therapy may be required to maintain serum glucose levels less than 180 mg per dL. Initiation of low-dose corticosteroids may further improve survival in patients with septic shock that does not respond to vasopressor therapy. Timely initiation of evidence-based protocols should improve sepsis outcomes.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1115wEis]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

### Antibiotic therapy in patients with septic shock [^1168YUbb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of a patient with severe sepsis is first to diagnose the infection, to collect samples immediately after diagnosis and to initiate promptly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be based on host characteristics, site of infection, local ecology and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotics. In severe infection, guidelines recommend the use of a combination of antibiotics. After results of cultures are obtained, treatment should be re-evaluated to either de-escalate or escalate the antibiotics. This is associated with optimal costs, decreased incidence of superinfection and reduced development of antimicrobial resistance. All these steps should be based on written protocols, and compliance to these protocols should be monitored continuously in order to detect violations and implement corrective procedures.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of emergency department discharge among patients with sepsis [^1126e2f6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Current sepsis treatment guidelines and quality metrics presume that emergency department (ED) patients with sepsis syndrome (defined as organ failure from a dysregulated host response to infection) will be admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Most studies of sepsis to date have focused on patients who were admitted to the hospital (likely more than 1.7 million annually in the US) or the subset of patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit. However, 1 study that applied objective clinical criteria for identifying patients with sepsis in the ED noted incidentally that a substantial fraction of such patients may be discharged from the ED for outpatient treatment.

Unlike for pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, validated risk scores, clinical trials, and guidelines are not available to guide outpatient disposition decisions for ED patients with sepsis. To our knowledge, the epidemiology of patients with sepsis who were discharged from the ED has not been previously investigated systematically. Consequently, the extent to which such discharges from the ED of patients with clinical sepsis reflect missed diagnoses, improper treatment judgments, patient preferences, or appropriate triage of low-risk patients to outpatient management is unclear. It is also unclear whether ED sepsis disposition is subject to disparities in patient sex or race and ethnicity or affected by nonclinical factors, such as ED busyness or physician practice style.

In the present study, we therefore investigated the prevalence, risk factors, practice variation, and outcomes for discharge to outpatient treatment among ED patients with sepsis. Specifically, we identified patient, clinician, and system factors that were associated with outpatient disposition and compared risk-adjusted 30-day mortality after the initial inpatient vs outpatient treatment assignment from the ED.

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Early recognition and emergency treatment of sepsis and septic shock in children [^113H6zcE]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock in children results in improved outcomes. However, diagnosis is hampered by lack of specific diagnostic tests and relies on the recognition of the alterations of vital signs and protean systemic manifestations associated with infections, signs that mimic many critical illnesses. As a result, the early diagnosis of sepsis is usually presumptive and is based on the suspicion or presence of an infection in combination with the systemic changes. Suspicion should be heightened in vulnerable risk groups such as those with immune compromise due to underlying disease or medication use. Thus, on many occasions, treatment of sepsis is initiated on clinical suspicion pending the outcomes of ongoing evaluations and laboratory findings. What is of relevance to the emergency clinicians is the initial recognition, resuscitation, and treatment in the first few hours of presentation. To best accomplish these tasks, contemporary guidelines suggest that the use of a "recognition bundle" containing a trigger tool for rapid identification, a "resuscitation and stabilization bundle" to enable adherence to best practice, and a "performance bundle" to identify and overcome barriers to best practice be used. Although there are no universally acceptable tools to accomplish these tasks, the various iterations used in quality improvement initiatives have consistently demonstrated better care processes and outcomes. In this article, we outline the contemporary approach to sepsis in the first hours after presentation.

Antibiotics — timing by sepsis status and shock: For sepsis classified as "Definite or Probable" with septic shock "Present or Absent", antimicrobial timing is "Immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock". For "Possible" sepsis with septic shock "Present", timing is also "Immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock". For "Possible" sepsis with septic shock "Absent", the guidance states "Rapid evaluation, and if concern for infection persists, it is reasonable to administer antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized".

### Sepsis: an update in management [^116m6dEG]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hospitalists are a critical link in providing evidence-based care for patients with sepsis across the disease spectrum, from early recognition to recovery. The past decade of sepsis research has led to significant findings that will change clinical practice for hospital medicine practitioners. Although the incidence of severe sepsis in the United States has continued to rise, in-hospital mortality has declined. Management of the spectrum of sepsis disorders is no longer restricted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This review article will provide an update in the management of sepsis for hospitalists based on recently published pivotal studies. The expanding evidence base in sepsis includes early goal-directed therapy/clinical endpoints/sepsis bundles, antibiotics and source control, volume resuscitation, ICU considerations (including the use of insulin and corticosteroids), mortality/complications, and the newly recognized condition of "sepsis survivorship".

### Anaesthetic management of patients with severe sepsis [^117Erb5g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis, a syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation and acute organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a major healthcare problem affecting all age groups throughout the world. Anaesthetists play a central role in the multidisciplinary management of patients with severe sepsis from their initial deterioration at ward level, transfer to the diagnostic imaging suite, and intraoperative management for emergency surgery. The timely administration of appropriate i.v. antimicrobial therapy is a crucial step in the care of patients with severe sepsis who may require surgery to control the source of sepsis. Preoperative resuscitation, aimed at optimizing major organ perfusion, is based on judicious use of fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes. Intraoperative anaesthesia management requires careful induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, optimizing intravascular volume status, avoidance of lung injury during mechanical ventilation, and ongoing monitoring of arterial blood gases, lactate concentration, haematological and renal indices, and electrolyte levels. Postoperative care overlaps with ongoing management of the severe sepsis syndrome patient in the intensive care unit. These patients are by definition, high risk, already requiring multiple supports, and require experienced and skilful decision-making to optimize their chances of a favourable outcome. Similar to acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or acute trauma, the initial hours (golden hours) of clinical management of severe sepsis represent an important opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality. Rapid clinical assessment, resuscitation and surgical management by a focused multidisciplinary team, and early effective antimicrobial therapy are the key components to improved patient outcome.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^1123c9fG]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113p97aa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Raising concerns about the Sepsis-3 definitions

Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors. If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impairment of one or more vital organs or systems. There are many well-known risk factors for the infections that most commonly precipitate organ dysfunction, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many cancers, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and advanced age. Although big steps forward have been made, the pathophysiological mechanisms for organ dysfunction are not entirely known, but it has become apparent that infection triggers a much more complex, variable, and prolonged host response, involving early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Sepsis has variable clinical presentations depending on the initial site of infection, the causative organism, the pattern of acute organ dysfunction, and the underlying health status of the patient.

There is general consensus that early recognition and timely treatment largely determine outcome of sepsis.

Since the first classification in 1991, the definition of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, though imprecise, have provided the clinicians a useful framework for clinical management, stressing the need for early recognition, and when these criteria are followed by the application of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, they have an impressive history of success in reducing the mortality of sepsis in several areas of the world.

Several studies demonstrated that sepsis-related mortality reduced steadily over the years. A meta-analysis reported a reduction of sepsis 28-day mortality rates from 46.9% during the period 1991–1995 to 29% during 2006–2009. In the United States, mortality due to severe sepsis decreased by 51% from 1988 to 2012. In Australia and New Zealand, an overall decrease of 16.7% in hospital sepsis mortality was reported between 2000 and 2012 (from 35 to 18.4%). However, high mortality rates are still reported in low- and middle-income countries.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America position paper: recommended revisions to the national severe sepsis and septic shock early management bundle (SEP-1) sepsis quality measure [^116Nh8HK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure has appropriately established sepsis as a national priority. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA and five additional endorsing societies) is concerned about SEP-1's potential to drive antibiotic overuse because it does not account for the high rate of sepsis overdiagnosis and encourages aggressive antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis, regardless of the certainty of diagnosis or severity of illness. IDSA is also concerned that SEP-1's complex "time zero" definition is not evidence-based and is prone to inter-observer variation. In this position paper, IDSA outlines several recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of unintended consequences of SEP-1 while maintaining focus on its evidence-based elements. IDSA's core recommendation is to limit SEP-1 to septic shock, for which the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate antibiotics is greatest. Prompt empiric antibiotics are often appropriate for suspected sepsis without shock, but IDSA believes there is too much heterogeneity and difficulty defining this population, uncertainty about the presence of infection, and insufficient data on the necessity of immediate antibiotics to support a mandatory treatment standard for all patients in this category. IDSA believes guidance on managing possible sepsis without shock is more appropriate for guidelines that can delineate the strengths and limitations of supporting evidence and allow clinicians discretion in applying specific recommendations to individual patients. Removing sepsis without shock from SEP-1 will mitigate the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for noninfectious syndromes, simplify data abstraction, increase measure reliability, and focus attention on the population most likely to benefit from immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^111T4vxG]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.

### Recommendations for infection management in patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings [^114RKgiT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results and recommendations for management of infections in resource-limited settings

There are important differences in the causative pathogens of sepsis and septic shock between resource-rich and resource-limited settings, as well as substantial variation between and within resource-limited settings. Hospital, and especially ICU-related, infections are more likely to be caused by multidrug-resistant organisms and previous antibiotic use is a risk factor for antibiotic resistance. Misdirected initial antibiotic therapy is associated with poor outcome, but there is a paucity of epidemiological data in most low-resourced settings. We recommend empirical antibiotic therapy should cover all expected pathogens and likely resistance patterns (1C) based on locally-acquired epidemiological data as large regional variations exist (ungraded). We recognize that, in settings with a limited range of available antibiotics, this may be challenging. We suggest that research groups in collaboration with stakeholders provide microbiological data from sentinel sites throughout resource-limited settings to guide local empirical antibiotic choices (ungraded).

There is weak evidence from resource-limited settings suggesting that timely administration of antibiotics is beneficial. Observational data suggest that, in many resource-limited settings, the administration of antibiotics to most patients within 1 h of sepsis or septic shock recognition is feasible. Therefore, given biological plausibility and evidence from resource-rich settings, we recommend appropriate antibiotics should be given within the first hour following sepsis or septic shock recognition (1C).

In resource-limited settings, microbiological laboratory facilities are often restricted, but there was evidence from these settings that taking blood cultures was associated with improved outcome in sepsis and septic shock and with improved appropriateness of antibiotics. No studies addressed incremental costs of implementing microbiological capacity, or additional benefits of two sets of blood cultures. We recommend that blood cultures should be taken before the administration of antibiotics in locations where this is possible (1B). Ideally, two sets of blood cultures should be obtained. It is realized that in many hospitals routine blood culture is unfeasible, but a recommendation of expanding microbiological laboratory capacity is beyond the scope of these recommendations (Table 1).

They also include using capillary refill time as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion to help guide resuscitation, with use of capillary refill time to guide resuscitation accompanied by frequent and repeated comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or improve early recognition of fluid overload. Additional guidance includes using a decrease in serum lactate to help guide fluid resuscitation of patients with an elevated lactate level and using an initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg for septic shock requiring vasopressors.

### Sepsis: older and newer concepts [^114vkeXW]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common complication in patients in intensive care units and a frequent reason for intensive care unit admission. Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and, without specific antisepsis therapies, management relies on infection control and organ support. For these interventions to be most effective, they must be started early, which highlights the need for all health-care workers to be aware of sepsis so that diagnosis can be made as early as possible. In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of the earlier terms used to characterise and define sepsis, and point out some of their limitations. We then introduce some aspects of new consensus definitions, proposed by an expert panel, which highlight in particular the importance of organ dysfunction. These definitions should help provide a more standardised approach to the identification of patients with suspected sepsis in both clinical practice and clinical research.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^1148pq6L]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The pathogenesis of sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune system and the infecting microorganisms. Sepsis describes a broad-based syndrome covering many infectious agents, affecting various sites in patients of differing age, gender, and comorbidity. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and death. Despite remarkable advances in the management of patients with sepsis, its recognition and timely, appropriate treatment remain of utmost importance.

The Sepsis-3 definitions underline the concept of a dysregulated immune response resulting in potentially modifiable life-threatening organ dysfunction. However, they may fail in identifying patients with serious infections before organ dysfunction ensues.

Downplaying infections that do not meet the current Sepsis-3 criteria may hinder their identification, resulting in an unnecessary increase in both morbidity and mortality due to their inexorable progression in the following hours.

Clear definitions for sepsis and septic shock should guide clinicians both to support early recognition of at-risk patients and to facilitate an understanding of the global epidemiology of sepsis.

Sepsis is a burden for global health. Its global nature calls for a global response, both in the geographic sense and across the whole range of sectors involved.

In this paper, we have raised our concerns regarding the Sepsis-3 definitions. We believe that in order for sepsis definitions to be universally accepted, they should facilitate clinical care on a global scale.

On Friday, May 26th, 2017, the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization made sepsis a global health priority, by adopting a resolution to improve, prevent, diagnose, and manage sepsis.

The Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery suggests that future revisions have a more global perspective and include a wider range of representatives and expertise. We also hope our comments can serve as a basis for future discussions on how to further improve the definitions of the sepsis continuum.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^111fhrDL]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis varies in its clinical manifestations over time, which necessitates different requirements for identification of sepsis across the various stages of its progression. In the early phases, clinicians may have limited information available, but require criteria to make a presumptive diagnosis that is sufficient to implement effective therapeutic approaches. At later stages, clinicians usually have access to substantive information, including results of diagnostic testing, clinical progression, and response to therapy, to allow a definitive diagnosis. This concept enables clinicians to consider parameters for early initiation of antibiotic therapy, while allowing early termination of antibiotic therapy, once additional information allows for reevaluation of the diagnosis and risk. To ensure widespread adoption and patient benefit, criteria for sepsis should correlate with clinically relevant intervention points (e.g. invasive bacterial infection = antibiotic therapy, organ dysfunction = organ support therapy), as well as the risk of mortality in each situation.

Sepsis represents a broad umbrella term covering a condition that may be caused by a wide range of pathogens (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic). There are no simple and unambiguous clinical, biological, imaging, or laboratory features that uniquely identify a patient with sepsis. The lack of rapid and reliable sepsis tests hampers the ability to make a definitive diagnosis of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, at the time of presentation.

Dysregulation of host response includes imbalances in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory states driven by the innate and adaptive immune systems and contributing to new or worsening organ injury and death. The adult Sepsis-3 criteria emphasize the importance of identification of organ dysfunction in patients with infection and have led to research that improves our mechanistic understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis, including infection-specific biology and responses to specific interventions. In this context, phenotyping using biological and clinical characteristics, and specific pathophysiology, has great potential to be employed as an enrichment strategy in the evaluation of treatment responses.

### Sepsis: key insights, future directions, and immediate goals. A review and expert opinion [^117D2nTa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review explores the current landscape and evolving understanding of sepsis, highlighting both challenges and future directions. Sepsis remains a major global health burden, with diverse clinical presentations complicating timely diagnosis and management. Existing definitions, including the Sepsis-3 criteria, emphasize the importance of organ dysfunction, yet early sepsis detection remains limited by available tools. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, though widely used, may not fully capture early stages of infection or account for complex presentations like noncatecholamine-resistant shock. Additionally, the review underscores the pressing need for standardized terminology across sepsis and shock characterization to ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment strategies. Accessible, resource-adapted solutions are particularly crucial in low- and middle-income countries where sepsis-related mortality rates are higher due to limited resources. Future research should focus on developing and validating integrated, multi-parameter tools that combine clinical, biochemical, and microbiological data to improve sepsis outcomes globally. Advancing sepsis care will require both technological innovation and collaborative, globally consistent guidelines to bridge disparities in healthcare delivery.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^112y9Acr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Maternal sepsis is an obstetric emergency and a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Early recognition in a pregnant or postpartum patient can be a challenge as the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy may mask the signs and symptoms of sepsis. Bedside assessment tools may aid in the detection of maternal sepsis. Timely and targeted antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation are critical for survival in patients with suspected sepsis. Once diagnosed, a search for etiologies and early application of source control measures will further reduce harms. If the patient is in septic shock or not responding to initial treatment, multidisciplinary consultation and escalation of care is necessary. Health care professionals should be aware of the unique complications of sepsis in critically ill pregnant and postpartum patients, and measures to prevent poor outcomes in this population. Adverse pregnancy outcomes may occur in association with sepsis, and should be anticipated and prevented when possible, or managed appropriately when they occur. Using a standardized approach to the patient with suspected sepsis may reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy (indications), SSC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a time-limited course of rapid investigation in adult patients with possible sepsis without shock, and administering antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized, if concern for infection persists.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Factors and outcomes associated with under-and overdiagnosis of sepsis in the first hour of emergency department care [^1115sEoR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Sepsis is a life‐threatening, heterogeneous syndrome with a significant medical burden. As the third leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals, sepsis impacts around 1.7 million people annually. Hospitalizations for sepsis are alarmingly common and deadly, with incidences ranging from 28.9 to 121.3 per 1000 hospitalizationsand an estimated mortality rate of 26.7%. As the most expensive inpatient condition in the United States, sepsis not only affects patients but also places a substantial burden on health care resources.

The diagnosis of sepsis is challenging due to its complex and often nonspecific clinical presentation. Certain groups experience disparities in sepsis management and outcomes. Furthermore, sepsis misdiagnosis may be influenced by various clinical characteristics. Diagnostic errors in sepsis, including both under‐ and overdiagnosis, can lead to delayed treatment or unnecessary interventions, adversely affecting patient outcomes. Timely recognition and accurate diagnosis of sepsis are crucial, as studies show a substantial increase in mortality with each hour of delay in administration of antibiotics, potentially as high as 7% per hour, starting as soon as 1 h after recognizing sepsis. Practically, however, "sepsis recognition" remains a loose and poorly defined term, often defined retrospectively based on the decision to order blood cultures or antibiotics. The lack of a clear definition impedes progress toward improving time to antibiotic administration in the patients who need it most. The risks of diagnostic delays, however, must be weighed against both antibiotic stewardship and logistic considerations, which have been incompletely addressed to date.

Management Recommendations

International consensus guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock published by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign reference studies primarily conducted among patients with COS. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations inform the CMS sepsis metric (SEP-1), to which adherence is publicly reported as a quality metric for acute care hospitals in the United States. However, whether and how these recommendations should be applied to patients with HOS has not been established. As such, the research priorities identified here have significant implications for quality improvement initiatives directed toward patients with HOS, including potential modifications of current sepsis guidelines.

Given clinical differences between the groups, and the fact that patients with HOS have largely been excluded from sepsis clinical trials, whether some recommendations confer the same benefits for patients with HOS as for those with COS is unclear. Although administration of IV fluids has been associated with reduced duration of shock among patients with COS, the same effect has not been demonstrated among patients with HOS. Particularly given increasing equipoise regarding the benefits of aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for sepsis, concerns about the potential harms of overresuscitation, and data suggesting heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups, additional research is needed to understand how current sepsis resuscitation recommendations and practices impact outcomes in HOS.

Although rapid antimicrobial administration has been shown to be associated with improved mortality rates in patients with HOS, the optimal timing for treatment initiation and microbial coverage has not been established. Recommendations must balance the need for prompt treatment and appropriately broad coverage in this high-risk group with the realities of diagnostic uncertainty and need for appropriate risk assessment and infectious workup to guide therapy in the face of higher prevalence of fungal and multi-drug-resistant organisms in HOS.

Identification of clinical phenotypes may be helpful to examine the risks and benefits of resuscitation and treatment strategies among subgroups of patients with HOS, informing targeted enrollment in clinical trials enriched for patients most likely to benefit from given treatment arms.

### Insights into severe sepsis in older patients: from epidemiology to evidence-based management [^112KV6nH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 60% of patients who develop severe sepsis in the United States are ≥ 65 years of age, and the incidence of sepsis in this population is steadily increasing. Elderly individuals have an increased risk of developing sepsis, compared with younger patients, because of frequent comorbidities, institutionalization, declining performance status, and altered immune function. The clinical presentation of older patients with sepsis is often atypical, leading to a difficult and delayed diagnosis. Although increasing age appears to confer a high risk of death due to severe sepsis, recent evidence shows that many older patients respond well to selected interventions when the interventions are initiated in a timely fashion. Newly published clinical practice guidelines outline key recommendations regarding the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Clinicians must be aware of the level of evidence in support of various interventions and must keenly screen older survivors for ongoing deficits that will limit their functional recovery.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115tq8DD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials

The 2016 guidelines recommend administering empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover all likely pathogens, including bacteria and potentially viruses/fungi (depending on the risk factors of the patient). The initial empiric antibiotic regimen for patients in septic shock should include at least two antibiotics from different classes (combination therapy) directed toward the most likely pathogens. Treatment should be narrowed once the pathogen and its antimicrobial sensitivities are ascertained or when the patient demonstrates clinical improvement. However, patients with bacteremia, neutropenic sepsis or sepsis without shock do not require combination antibiotic therapy. This is a notable difference from the 2012 recommendation that neutropenic sepsis be treated with empiric combination antimicrobials. The authors note, however, that these recommendations do not preclude the use of multiple antibiotics if the goal is to expand the spectrum of pathogens covered.

With respect to antibiotic duration, combination therapy (either empiric or targets) in patients with septic shock should be de-escalated to monotherapy within a few days if clinical improvement or with evidence of infection resolution. This is slightly different than the 2012 guidelines, which recommend that no more than 3–5 days of empiric combination therapy and de-escalation as soon as the responsible organism and susceptibilities are known. Total treatment duration should be 7–10 days for infections with sepsis or septic shock; however, some patients may warrant a prolonged course if they respond slowly to treatment, do not have source control, have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus or have immunological deficiencies or fungal/viral infections.

One new recommendation in 2016 is that shorter antibiotic courses are indicated in patients whose sepsis resolves rapidly after source previously, the 2016 authors recommend daily assessments for potential de-escalation of antimicrobials. Failure to normalize procalcitonin levels has recently been shown in a prospective multicenter study to be a significant predictor of mortality. For those who initially appear septic, but do not subsequently have clinical evidence of infection, it can also be used to shorten or discontinue antimicrobial therapy. It is important to note that blood cultures can be negative in up to one-third of all patients suffering from sepsis. Lastly, the campaign does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for non-infectious inflammatory states such as burns or severe pancreatitis.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: what needs to be done? [^114F6J9r]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Attention to the pre-hospital phase in patients with sepsis is clearly critical. The initial link in this chain is to increase awareness of the symptoms of sepsis amongst the general public. Organizations such as the Global Sepsis Alliance and initiatives like World Sepsis Day, which work to raise awareness of sepsis, play a crucial role in alerting the general public about the importance of seeking medical attention when they or a loved one displays the symptoms of sepsis. Pre-hospital care also plays an important role in recognizing and providing prompt care for patients with sepsis. Approximately 50% of the patients who present to the emergency department with sepsis will arrive via an Emergency Medical Service (EMS). This exposure provides an excellent opportunity to improve early recognition of sepsis and to commence an integrated system of care for these complex patients. For example, in a pilot prospective cohort study conducted in the pre-hospital setting, early identification of patients with severe sepsis by EMS providers utilizing a screening tool and a point-of-care venous lactate meter was shown to be feasible. Once identified, there is scope for interventions, such as intravenous cannulation and initiation of intravenous fluids provided pre-hospital, to influence the outcomes of patients with sepsis.

An enhanced focus on the identification of sepsis in the emergency department setting, as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with improved outcomes. Identifying patients with sepsis in a busy emergency department may be aided by the use of electronic sepsis alert systems, or a screening tool that combines simple clinical characteristics with the use of early lactate measurements. Simple tools have been combined in successful large-scale quality improvement programs, such as the Sepsis Kills campaign, run by the Clinical Excellence Commission in NSW, Australia, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. It is very likely that the increased focus on sepsis by clinical champions, and the awareness amongst front line staff regarding the possibility of sepsis that accompanies such campaigns, is responsible for much of the improved outcomes demonstrated in these programs.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^1122NEbj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Maternal sepsis is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Recognition of maternal sepsis remains a challenge for health care workers as the signs and symptoms of maternal sepsis often overlap with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy. Implementation of a simple bedside screen with immediate evaluation if the screen is positive may aid in the early diagnosis of maternal sepsis and timely treatment. Once diagnosed, appropriate antibiotics should be initiated within the first hour, and hypoperfusion corrected. Further evaluation for end-organ damage and a search for etiologies of maternal sepsis and application of source control measures may reduce morbidity and mortality. If the patient is in septic shock or not responding to initial treatment, rapid escalation of care with multidisciplinary collaboration is necessary to optimize outcomes. Adverse pregnancy outcomes occur in association with maternal sepsis, and should be anticipated and prevented when possible or managed appropriately when they occur. In summary, early recognition, focused evaluation, and expedient treatment tailored to the most likely etiology of maternal sepsis, including aggressive source control, are necessary steps to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from sepsis.

### The sepsis chain of survival: a comprehensive framework for improving sepsis outcomes [^111UgGx4]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CALL TO ACTION

The Sepsis Chain of Survival provides a structured framework that simplifies and organizes existing best practices into a cohesive and actionable interdependent interventions. This framework is designed to be implemented across the continuum of care, encompassing both community and in-hospital locations. The steps are not necessarily linear and do not have to be implemented in sequence, but all steps should be considered in a systematic approach to management of patients with sepsis. It emphasizes the importance of engaging both healthcare systems and communities in the early recognition and effective management of sepsis. The Sepsis Chain of Survival is a "call to action" for healthcare systems worldwide to adopt an integrated, systematic approach to sepsis management for patients of all ages, contextualized at the local level. Promotion of community and healthcare provider awareness and action promotes response to the challenge of treating life-threatening sepsis. The concept of the Sepsis Chain of Survival highlights the necessity of a cohesive and coordinated effort, encouraging optimization of each link, highlighting interdependence of the steps necessary to improve survival and patient/family quality of life outcomes across resource variable settings.

The implementation of a Sepsis Chain of Survival requires a coordinated effort across diverse community and healthcare settings. The following actions are identified:

Public Awareness Campaigns: Increase public awareness about what sepsis is, and the importance of early recognition and prompt medical attention.
Healthcare Provider Training: Enhance training programs for healthcare providers and emergency responders on the early recognition and context-specific management of sepsis.
Standardized Protocols: Establish standardized, context-appropriate protocols for sepsis management that include prediction, prevention, early recognition, and comprehensive coordinated and team-based care.
Resource Allocation: Ensure necessary tools and support are provided to implement the Sepsis Chain of Survival effectively across resource variable settings.
Health Systems Strengthening: In LRS, the availability of essential treatments such as antibiotics, fluids, and oxygen is important.
Continuous Audit, Monitoring, and Evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Sepsis Chain of Survival to identify areas for improvement and ensure optimal patient outcomes.

By integrated actions in a Sepsis Chain of Survival, patient survival and recovery can be enhanced, ultimately improving outcomes for sepsis patients globally.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric — implications of recommendation strength are outlined as follows: For a strong recommendation, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and such recommendations can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators. For a weak recommendation, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances, such as patients' or family's values and preferences, and policies will likely be variable. A best practice statement indicates implications to patients, clinicians, and policymakers are the same as strong recommendation.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Early goal-directed therapy: what do we do now? [^113yg4KL]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols. That would be good news indeed for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis: increased prehospital blood lactate levels for identifying sicker patients who may benefit from prehospital antibiotic therapy initiation [^115RmMVr]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest the recent review published in the Journal by Niederman et al. emphasizing that immediate, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to severe sepsis and/or shock patients reduces mortality, despite the fact that it can lead to antimicrobial overuse and resistance; and should be accompanied by an early de-escalation and antimicrobial stewardship.

Early sepsis recognition and appropriate treatment initiation, mainly antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization, are cornerstones for management of septic patients, especially the sicker ones, to improve prognosis. As underlined by Niederman et al. sepsis occurs commonly outside the hospital environment in 70% of cases, requiring either ambulatory treatment or hospital admission for the most severe form. Nevertheless, for the latter, antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization will only be initiated in the emergency department. With the exception of the most severe cases for which the diagnosis is obvious, e.g. purpura fulminans or patients with low blood pressure and skin mottling in a sepsis context, sepsis diagnose, and severity assessment remain a daily challenge in the prehospital field. For those patients, we suggest using the point of care (POC) lactate measurement. On the one hand, blood lactate level is a criterion for septic shock diagnosis and is associated with poorer outcome among septic shock patients. On the other hand, POC lactate measurement devices have been validated in the prehospital environment. Therefore, we suggest that a prehospital sepsis severity assessment strategy based on blood lactate level POC assessment may be helpful in identifying the sicker septic patients, i.e. those for whom, in order to reduce sepsis related mortality, prehospital antibiotic therapy instauration cannot wait until hospital admission and should be initiated from the point of prehospital care.

Información general La septicemia es una respuesta extrema del cuerpo a una infección. Es una emergencia médica potencialmente mortal. La septicemia ocurre cuando una infección que se tiene provoca una reacción en cadena por todo el cuerpo. Las infecciones que causan septicemia suelen comenzar en los pulmones, las vías urinarias, la piel o el tubo digestivo. Sin tratamiento oportuno, puede causar rápidamente daño en los tejidos, insuficiencia orgánica y la muerte. Signos y síntomas Una persona con septicemia podría tener uno o más de los siguientes signos o síntomas:

- Frecuencia cardiaca rápida, o pulso bajo o débil.
- Fiebre, escalofríos o sensación de mucho frío.
- Confusión o desorientación.
- Dificultad para respirar.
- Molestias o dolor extremo.
- Piel sudorosa o húmeda. Se necesita que un profesional de la salud haga una evaluación médica para confirmar la septicemia.

Las infecciones los pueden poner a usted y a su familia en riesgo de tener una afección potencialmente mortal llamada septicemia. Cuando entran microbios al cuerpo de una persona, estos pueden causar una infección. Si usted no detiene esa infección, puede causar septicemia. La mayoría de los casos de septicemia son causados por infecciones bacterianas. La septicemia también puede ser el resultado de otras infecciones, incluidas las infecciones virales, como la del COVID-19 o la influenza, o infecciones fúngicas. Con una identificación y tratamiento rápidos, la mayoría de las personas sobreviven. El tratamiento requiere atención médica de urgencia, generalmente en una unidad de cuidados intensivos en un hospital, e incluye monitorear atentamente los signos vitales y generalmente antibióticos. Tratamiento Las investigaciones muestran que el tratamiento rápido y eficaz contra la septicemia incluye:

- La administración del tratamiento apropiado, incluidos los antibióticos.
- El mantenimiento del flujo sanguíneo a los órganos. A veces, se necesita una operación para remover los tejidos dañados por la infección. Los profesionales de atención médica deberían tratar la septicemia con antibióticos lo antes posible. Los antibióticos son herramientas para el tratamiento de las infecciones potencialmente mortales, como aquellas que pueden causar la septicemia. Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta la resistencia a los antibióticos, las infecciones se están haciendo más difíciles de tratar.
