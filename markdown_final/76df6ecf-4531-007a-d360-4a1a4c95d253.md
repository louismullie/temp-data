## Question

Osteomyelitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about osteomyelitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining osteomyelitis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should classify the clinical syndromes and epidemiology. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including labs, imaging, and biopsy. After that, I need to outline treatment principles, including antibiotics, surgery, and special populations. Finally, I should consider monitoring, response assessment, and key controversies, and close with a concise, practical algorithm and takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone caused by infection, most commonly bacterial, with Staphylococcus aureus predominating; it can be acute or chronic, hematogenous or contiguous, and in chronic disease, avascular necrosis and sequestrum formation create sanctuaries that impede host immunity and antibiotics, necessitating surgical debridement for cure in many cases [^3419874d] [^202ae45f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about classification; I should verify the accepted frameworks. The major axes are acute versus chronic, hematogenous versus contiguous, and pediatric versus adult patterns, with pediatric disease often hematogenous and adult disease more often contiguous from trauma, surgery, or soft tissue infection; vertebral osteomyelitis is a distinct entity with its own diagnostic and management nuances, and chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO/CRMO) is an autoinflammatory mimic that must be excluded when cultures are negative and imaging is atypical for infection [^e7e55613] [^3419874d] [^c4ccd917].

> I need to check epidemiology to anchor pretest probability. In children, acute hematogenous osteomyelitis incidence ranges roughly 1.2 to 13 per 100,000 per year, with long bones most commonly involved and a median age around 6 to 8 years; in adults, incidence is higher in older adults and those with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or prosthetic joints, and vertebral osteomyelitis becomes relatively more prominent with advancing age [^c95bfff1] [^95d8e327].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach, starting with clinical suspicion. Pain, swelling, erythema, and systemic features such as fever are common, but symptoms can be subtle, especially in chronic disease or immunocompromised hosts; I should double-check that the threshold for evaluation is lower in high-risk groups like people with diabetes, recent trauma or surgery, or prosthetic material [^fe4c7c44] [^d173a5d4].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inflammatory markers because I recall they are nonspecific. ESR and CRP are often elevated but have limited diagnostic accuracy; in children, serial CRP can help monitor response, but in adults, routine serial biomarkers have not reliably predicted outcomes or altered management, so I should avoid overinterpreting isolated values and integrate them with clinical and imaging data [^b5405dfe] [^b1d648eb] [^38d6e398].

> I will now examine imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I align with guidelines. Plain radiography is insensitive early but remains a reasonable first step; MRI with and without contrast is the modality of choice for suspected osteomyelitis due to superior sensitivity and specificity, with CT or nuclear medicine reserved for MRI contraindications or specific scenarios like hardware artifact; for vertebral osteomyelitis, MRI is first-line and has high diagnostic performance, and if MRI is negative but suspicion remains high, repeating imaging in 1 to 3 weeks is reasonable [^824300f5] [^dac0007a] [^b55dc9a5].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of biopsy and microbiology because this is often decisive. Definitive diagnosis rests on bone biopsy with culture and histopathology; swabs of sinus tracts are discouraged due to poor correlation with deep pathogens, and blood cultures should be obtained in vertebral disease and in children when feasible; in suspected vertebral osteomyelitis, image-guided biopsy is recommended when blood cultures are negative or when atypical organisms are suspected, and a second biopsy is advised if the first is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high [^ba49dbb2] [^6242ba44] [^778f0d1d] [^ccc0e8e0].

> Let me think about treatment principles, and I should confirm duration and route. For acute hematogenous osteomyelitis without necrosis, antibiotics alone may suffice, whereas chronic disease with sequestrum generally requires surgical debridement plus antibiotics; historically, durations of 4 to 6 weeks parenterally were standard, but contemporary evidence supports a total of 6 weeks for most pyogenic osteomyelitis without retained implants, with randomized data showing 6 weeks is noninferior to 12 weeks for vertebral osteomyelitis, and emerging guidance allows carefully selected oral step-down regimens after initial IV therapy when bioavailability and adherence are reliable [^3419874d] [^49e2d912] [^38d6e398].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child with suspected AHO; should I delay antibiotics for cultures? I should double-check the pediatric guidance. In ill-appearing children or those with rapidly progressive infection, empiric antibiotics should not be delayed; in stable children, a cautious delay of 24 to 72 hours to obtain bone or blood cultures may be reasonable, and observational data suggest cultures obtained within 24 to 48 hours of antibiotics may still yield pathogens, so the decision should be individualized and safety prioritized [^fab1e083] [^5945a176].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and mimics. In diabetic foot osteomyelitis, a positive probe-to-bone test supports the diagnosis, but imaging and bone biopsy remain important to confirm and guide therapy; in vertebral osteomyelitis, early MRI and timely biopsy when indicated improve diagnostic yield; in suspected CNO/CRMO, whole-body MRI can reveal multifocal, symmetric lesions and help exclude infection or malignancy, though biopsy may still be needed in atypical cases to confirm sterility and rule out mimics [^699cab40] [^b55dc9a5] [^7750db0c].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response assessment, and I need to be careful not to overuse tests. Serial clinical assessments of fever, pain, and function are paramount; in children, trending CRP can complement clinical evaluation, but in adults, routine serial inflammatory markers or repeat imaging have not consistently predicted outcomes; imaging is best reserved for clinical nonresponse or suspected complications such as abscess, pathologic fracture, or hardware failure [^b1d648eb] [^38d6e398].

> Let me reconsider key controversies so I don't overstate consensus. The optimal duration of therapy remains debated, though 6 weeks is evidence-based for many scenarios; the role of adjunctive rifampin is uncertain outside of prosthetic joint infection contexts; and the timing of empiric therapy before biopsy must balance diagnostic yield against the risk of progression, with emerging data suggesting cultures may remain positive shortly after antibiotics, which tempers the imperative to delay in all cases [^49e2d912] [^45019861] [^5945a176].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I should confirm the sequence. Suspect osteomyelitis based on clinical context; obtain baseline labs including ESR/CRP and blood cultures when appropriate; start with plain radiographs but proceed to MRI if suspicion remains high or if radiographs are normal; if MRI is negative but suspicion persists, repeat imaging in 1 to 3 weeks; obtain bone biopsy with culture and histology for definitive diagnosis and to guide therapy, especially in vertebral disease, chronic infection, or treatment failure; initiate empiric antibiotics promptly if the patient is ill-appearing or if progression is likely, otherwise consider a short delay to obtain cultures; tailor antibiotics to culture results and treat for a total of about 6 weeks when source control is adequate, adding surgical debridement for necrotic bone or refractory infection; monitor clinically and use CRP trends in children, reserving repeat imaging for nonresponders or complications [^824300f5] [^b55dc9a5] [^ba49dbb2] [^38d6e398] [^b1d648eb].

> In summary, I should emphasize that osteomyelitis management hinges on early recognition, judicious imaging, and definitive microbiology whenever feasible, with therapy individualized to disease chronicity, host factors, and source control; where evidence is strong, we should act decisively, and where evidence is limited, we should acknowledge uncertainty and align with multidisciplinary judgment and patient-centered goals [^3419874d] [^38d6e398].

Osteomyelitis is a **bone infection** [^3419874d] that can be acute or chronic, with hematogenous spread more common in children and contiguous or post-traumatic infection more common in adults [^fe4c7c44]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus MRI** [^dac0007a] [^824300f5], with definitive confirmation by bone biopsy and culture [^41299f04] [^ba49dbb2]. Empiric antibiotics should start promptly [^fab1e083], then be tailored to culture results [^d173a5d4]; duration is typically 4–6 weeks, and surgery is indicated for abscess, necrotic bone, or refractory cases [^c5272780] [^3419874d]. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are essential to prevent chronicity and complications [^3419874d].

---

## Classification and pathophysiology

Osteomyelitis is classified by **duration** (acute vs chronic), **mechanism** (hematogenous vs contiguous), and **patient population** (pediatric vs adult) [^e7e55613] [^fe4c7c44]. Acute osteomyelitis is a new infection within 4 weeks [^e7e55613]; chronic disease persists beyond this or recurs, often with necrotic bone (sequestrum) and fistulous tracts [^fe4c7c44]. Hematogenous spread is most common in children, whereas adults more often have contiguous infection from trauma, surgery, or soft-tissue infection [^fe4c7c44].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation varies by **age, pathogen, and chronicity**:

- **Acute osteomyelitis**: localized pain, swelling, erythema, fever, and systemic symptoms [^fe4c7c44].
- **Chronic osteomyelitis**: insidious pain, swelling, sinus tracts, and nonhealing ulcers; systemic symptoms are less common [^fe4c7c44].
- **Pediatric AHO**: often involves long bones (femur, tibia, humerus) and may present subtly [^c95bfff1].
- **Adult osteomyelitis**: frequently involves the spine, pelvis, or feet, especially in the setting of diabetes or vascular insufficiency [^c5272780].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Laboratory tests

- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR and CRP are often elevated but nonspecific; baseline measurements are recommended [^b5405dfe] [^ba49dbb2].
- **Blood cultures**: obtain in suspected hematogenous osteomyelitis; positive in ~50% of cases [^6242ba44].
- **Bone biopsy**: gold standard for definitive diagnosis and pathogen identification [^41299f04] [^ba49dbb2].

---

### Imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Role and utility** |
|-|-|
| Plain radiography | Initial study; insensitive early but useful for follow-up [^824300f5] [^087b360a] |
| MRI | Modality of choice; high sensitivity/specificity for early infection and soft-tissue extent [^dac0007a] [^b55dc9a5] |
| CT | Useful for cortical bone detail and surgical planning [^notfound] |
| Nuclear medicine (bone scan, PET) | Alternative when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^71af257e] |

---

## Microbiology

Staphylococcus aureus is the **most common pathogen** across ages [^notfound]. Pediatric AHO is often due to S. aureus, including MRSA, while chronic osteomyelitis in adults may involve gram-negative rods (e.g. Pseudomonas) or polymicrobial flora, particularly in diabetic foot infections [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Medical management

Empiric **intravenous antibiotics** should start promptly, then be narrowed to culture results [^d173a5d4]; total duration is typically 4–6 weeks, with IV therapy for 1–2 weeks followed by oral step-down when stable and adherent [^c5272780]. Recent data support **oral therapy** for select patients with good adherence and bioavailability [^38d6e398].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **abscess drainage**, **necrotic bone debridement**, **refractory infection**, or **prosthetic joint infection** [^3419874d]. Principles include thorough debridement, dead-space management, soft-tissue coverage, and stabilization [^1467dcc4].

---

## Complications

Complications include **chronic infection** with recurrence, **sequestrum formation**, **pathologic fractures**, **growth disturbances** in children, and **amputation risk** in diabetic foot disease [^3419874d] [^d1e3ed1c].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **timeliness of diagnosis**, adequacy of source control, and host factors. Acute osteomyelitis has a good prognosis with early treatment, whereas chronic disease carries significant morbidity and recurrence risk [^3419874d].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric AHO**: most children recover fully; monitor for growth disturbances and late complications [^cd31e4fb].
- **Diabetic foot osteomyelitis**: requires aggressive management and multidisciplinary care to prevent amputation [^notfound].
- **Vertebral osteomyelitis**: MRI is first-line; consider image-guided biopsy if blood cultures are negative [^b55dc9a5] [^778f0d1d].

---

Osteomyelitis is a serious bone infection requiring **early recognition**, accurate diagnosis, and coordinated medical-surgical care. MRI and bone biopsy are central to diagnosis, and prompt, pathogen-directed therapy with appropriate source control yields the best outcomes [^dac0007a] [^41299f04] [^3419874d].

### Osteomyelitis [^86578eec]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease with varied pathophysiology. The several clinical syndromes associated with bone infection have specific clinical presentations and microbiology. Successful recognition and management of the disease requires a knowledge of these mechanisms and the organisms most common in each. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical examination, supportive blood testing, and appropriate radiography. With these elements in place, patient presentation can be placed in the framework of a staging system, which often helps to suggest the appropriate mix of antimicrobial and surgical therapies.

### SAPHO and recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^e04dd8ae]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

SAPHO and recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis are complex inflammatory conditions that clinical radiologists play an essential part in diagnosing. They present with a wide range of musculoskeletal and skin manifestations, and exhibit several key diagnostic features that, when present, make the diagnoses unequivocal. The overall population group is young. Diagnostic delay is common with a relapsing and remitting clinical course and often subtle early radiologic findings. This article provides an up-to-date insight into both conditions, including their multifaceted pathogenesis, effective therapeutic options, and advanced imaging features, to arm radiologists with the knowledge required to make the diagnoses confidently in a timely manner.

### Challenges in the imaging and diagnosis of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) [^721f955c]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a benign skeletal disorder of childhood and adolescence characterised by sterile bone inflammation that results in chronic insidious bone pain. Although it is increasingly recognised, many challenges remain in its diagnosis with patients waiting 15–24 months for diagnosis from the time of symptom onset. Prompt identification and treatment are key to reducing morbidity from CNO, which affects school attendance and can result in chronic limb or spine deformities. Identifying its imaging features, particularly its characteristic lesion distribution on whole-body MRI, remains key to diagnosis. Image-guided biopsy is also required in many cases, particularly those with clinical uncertainty around the diagnosis. We present a review of the challenges encountered in the diagnosis of CNO from a critical appraisal of the literature and our experience as a national paediatric sarcoma, rheumatology and orthopaedic centre. This review hopes to inform radiology colleagues involved in the evaluation of potential CNO patients by discussing its imaging appearances, typical MRI phenotypes, potential mimics and the role of image-guided biopsy.

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis: insights into pathogenesis, assessment, and treatment [^c4ccd917]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, or its most severe form, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, is an autoinflammatory bone disease that causes skeletal inflammation characterized by bone pain and swelling that primarily affects children. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and its clinical presentation may mimic underlying infectious processes and malignancy. Clinical suspicion for this diagnosis and timely referral to pediatric rheumatology is crucial to achieve earlier diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and improved quality of life of affected patients and families. This article focuses on recent insights into the pathogenesis of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis and outlines recent advances and ongoing research.

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment [^d173a5d4]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to an infectious process. Osteomyelitis is usually clinically diagnosed with support from imaging and laboratory findings. Bone biopsy and microbial cultures offer definitive diagnosis. Plain film radiography should be performed as initial imaging, but sensitivity is low in the early stages of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media has a higher sensitivity for identifying areas of bone necrosis in later stages. Staging based on major and minor risk factors can help stratify patients for surgical treatment. Antibiotics are the primary treatment option and should be tailored based on culture results and individual patient factors. Surgical bony debridement is often needed, and further surgical intervention may be warranted in high-risk patients or those with extensive disease. Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease increase the overall risk of acute and chronic osteomyelitis.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^c9dc18ac]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Childhood osteomyelitis can be a challenging problem to both the clinician and the radiologist as the clinical presentation can be variable in severity, and laboratory results are relatively unsupportive in the diagnostic workup. Radiology plays a pivotal role in its diagnosis and can also be used to guide therapy and intervention. This review discusses the pathophysiology of childhood osteomyelitis and the clinical presentation. With respect to radiological imaging, it will focus on the application of radiological techniques in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis and the reported levels of evidence for the use of these techniques (Table 1).

Regarding diagnostic procedures for vertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to biopsy and culture, IDSA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider sending image-guided biopsy and aspiration specimens for fungal, mycobacterial, or brucella cultures in patients with suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis, if epidemiologic or host risk factors or characteristic radiologic clues are present.

### Dealing with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: a practical approach [^089afccd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CNO is a rare disorder and many considerations about diagnosis and treatment remain to be clarified. However, clinical features, the presence of multifocal lesions and radiologic features may help in diagnosis avoiding bone biopsy. NSAIDs remain the first treatment option, while bisphosphonates and TNF-alpha inhibitors could be considered the best second line treatment option. Even if CNO is often a benign disease, it can lead to severe and persistent complications.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^e7e55613]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute and chronic osteomyelitis definitions and course classifications define acute osteomyelitis as diagnosis of bone infection within 4 weeks after the onset of clinical manifestations in a previously uninfected bone, and chronic osteomyelitis as a more protracted, often indolent process with presence of a sequestrum and/or relapse of infection in the same site weeks to years after apparently successful treatment. Acute osteomyelitis presentations may be relatively mild or "subacute", and chronic osteomyelitis, while rare in childhood and adolescence in North America, can occur as an initial presentation or as a complication of AHO. The panel recognizes presentations that do not fit cleanly into the acute vs chronic dichotomy, such as Brodie abscess or indolent presentations with onset of symptoms or signs > 4 weeks before diagnosis without clear evidence of chronic osteomyelitis, and states that management of such presentations should be determined on a case-by-case basis and influenced by clinical and imaging response. Uncomplicated vs complicated designations are based on features of the clinical presentation and treatment course, and complicated infections are more likely to require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and a longer duration of therapy.

### Osteomyelitis: what you should know… [^c5272780]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

What is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood from a wound or infection somewhere else in the body. In children, it usually occurs in the arms and legs. In adults, it usually affects the feet, spine, or hips. People who smoke or have diabetes, a weak immune system, or poor circulation are more likely to get osteomyelitis. What are the symptoms. Children usually have pain, swelling, and redness over the infected area. They may have a fever or trouble moving the affected arm or leg. They may be more tired than usual. Adults may have a fever or feel tired. They may have pain in the area over the bone, and wounds that take longer to heal. Symptoms may take weeks to develop after the infection has started. How is it diagnosed. In children, osteomyelitis is usually diagnosed by the symptoms and a physical exam.

In adults, diagnosis can be harder because the symptoms and exam are not always clear. Blood tests can show an infection in the body. Other tests that take pictures of the inside of your body, such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, must also be done. The best way to tell if a patient has osteomyelitis is to remove a piece of damaged bone and test it for bacteria. How is it treated. The main treatment for children and adults is antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually given through an IV to get high doses of medicine into the blood. Then, antibiotic pills may be used. Children usually need about four weeks of antibiotics. Adults may need to take antibiotics for six to eight weeks. Sometimes surgery is needed to clean out the infected bone.

### Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: osteomyelitis [^6706968a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis can present to the emergency department as an acute, subacute, or chronic orthopedic concern. The presentation can range from subtle, as with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in the pediatric patient population, to obvious, as with the diabetic patient who presents with a foot ulcer overlying exposed bone. Accurate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, whether with antibiotics, debridement, or both, are important in helping determine the ultimate outcome in this potential orthopedic pitfall. We review here the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options for osteomyelitis that are applicable to the emergency practitioner.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

### Diagnostic imaging of pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis: lessons learned from a multi-modality approach [^3fcb00d0]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis may present highly variable radiological expression, which is influenced by the age and condition of the patient, the virulence of the causative agent, the stage of the disease, or the selected imaging tool. Given the multiplicity of available modalities and the multi-faceted nature of the process, purposeful imaging of pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis may be difficult. In order to avoid diagnostic delays and complications, familiarity with the variable expression of the disease and assumption of the potentialities, roles and limitations of the various imaging modalities is required. In this pictorial essay we review, illustrate and discuss, in a multi-modality approach, the various radiological patterns that may be found in pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis, with emphasis on strategies, staging, uncommon distribution patterns, and differential diagnosis.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^a62d61fe]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Osteomyelitis in childhood can be a challenging diagnosis. Imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis, and the imaging findings are pivotal in the treatment decision. As in all clinical cases the most important aspect of the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis lies in good cooperation among the paediatrician, paediatric orthopaedic surgeon and paediatric radiologist.

Question 6: What Is the Role and Optimal Utilization of Serial Biomarkers and/or Imaging Studies for Assessing Treatment Response in Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

In the absence of RCTs, observational studies have generally found that neither serial inflammatory biomarkers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) nor routinely repeated imaging accurately predict long-term treatment success for osteomyelitis or PJI for individual patients, nor have they been shown to meaningfully alter treatment decisions beyond clinical observation. Thus, following inflammatory biomarkers and repeated imaging may not offer benefit or contribute to high value care in most patients. Nonetheless, repeated imaging may be useful for patients who are clinically failing therapy to inform source control attempts, identify mechanical complications such as pathological fracture, and/or to trigger reconsideration of the initial diagnosis.

Question 7: What Is the Appropriate Duration of Therapy for Typical Cases of Osteomyelitis?

Clear Recommendation

Osteomyelitis (Including DFO) Without a Retained Implant

Based on 2 RCTs (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2), and concordant observational studies, we recommend a maximum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy for hematogenous or contiguous pyogenic osteomyelitis (including DFO), assuming adequate source control (ie, no undrained abscesses too large to be treated with antibiotics alone, possibly ≥ 2–3 cm in diameter) and no retained prosthetic implant (Table 4; eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Insufficient data are available to establish a clear recommendation for durations shorter than 6 weeks (see clinical review below).

### Enhancing diagnostics in orthopedic infections [^fb4402c0]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The clinical spectrum of orthopedic infection is broad, and enhancing diagnostics is crucial to ensure accurate diagnosis, treatment, and improved outcomes. Prompt recognition of the clinical syndrome with appropriate diagnostic sampling and treatment with antimicrobial therapy are cornerstones of management. Obtaining representative samples can be challenging and often requires invasive sampling. Host factors such as comorbid inflammatory conditions and immunosuppressive medications make recognizing and detecting infection more difficult. The central tenets of diagnostics in orthopedic infection revolve around two core principles: detection of the pathogen and detection of the host inflammatory response (Fig. 1). In general, accurate diagnosis hinges upon a patient-centric combination of these approaches.

### Two phenotypes of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis with different patterns of bone involvement [^76744999]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Even though our study has yielded several interesting findings, we must mention limitations that restrain us from offering general recommendations. First and foremost, the number of children with CRMO in this cohort is low. The retrospective approach in this study did not allow implementation of a uniform treatment protocol for all patients and a comprehensive evaluation of the treatment response between the two groups of CRMO. Importantly, our findings are in line with other studies indicating that CRMO is a heterogeneous disease and might be considered as an umbrella term for phenotypically similar disorders with potentially diverse etiopathogenetic backgrounds and sterile osteomyelitis as a dominant feature.

In conclusion, osteomyelitis as a dominant phenotypic feature of CRMO is accompanied by inflammation of other tissues in a substantial group of patients. The disease thus presents in two main forms, which we describe as 'bone-limited' and 'complex'. An alternative concept of CRMO as a clinical continuum between these two distinctive forms urges the need of more structured and targeted therapeutic strategies, which reflect the heterogeneity of the disease. Thorough clinical stratification of patients in a multicentre study followed by genetic-epigenetic studies can promote early identification of high-risk patients, who could benefit from more aggressive treatment with early therapy escalation.

Although there are relatively standard treatment approaches for chronic osteomyelitis, many avenues of investigation are being pursued to reflect contemporary concerns. The mainstays of care continue to include timely and thorough surgical débridement and culture-directed antibiotics. Sensitive diagnostic screening is essential, and advances in radiology can lead to early confirmation of disease and accurate surveillance. There is potential to greatly reduce overall morbidity, chance of recurrent infection, and treatment courses by using the local delivery systems currently researched by orthopedic surgeons. The challenges posed by multidrug-resistant bacterium may be countered by sound culturing techniques and new antibiotics. The general purpose of this article is to survey the new directions in oral surgery, orthopedics, infectious disease, immunology, and radiology that may have application to the treatment of maxillofacial osteomyelitis.

### Management of bone infections in adults: the surgeon's and microbiologist's perspectives [^4666b6ff]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Bone infection in adults is a potentially devastating complication following trauma or surgery. The clinician should diagnose osteomyelitis based on certain clinical manifestations and on laboratory and imaging findings. For pathogen identification, the treating surgeon should take appropriate tissue samples. Close collaboration with microbiologists is of paramount importance to dictate the appropriate duration and type of antibiotics to be administered. Treatment of acute osteomyelitis requires surgical debridement and prolonged course of antibiotics. Debate exists regarding the maintenance or the removal of any internal fixation device. Treatment of chronic osteomyelitis is more complicated. For its eradication the treatment course is often prolonged and frustrating. Based on the current literature an algorithm of treatment for both acute and chronic bone infections is recommended.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^a210855b]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to illustrate the imaging findings of childhood osteomyelitis. The diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis can be challenging. Clinical presentation and laboratory results can differ and are relatively unreliable. To date, its role in the assessment of treatment efficacy is not yet clear.

Methods

This review article provides an overview of the different imaging modalities and imaging characteristics of childhood osteomyelitis. Levels of evidence for different modalities are presented.

Results

Paediatric radiology plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis and can also be used to guide therapy and intervention.

Conclusion

Although imaging is essential in the diagnostic process, cooperation between the physician and radiologist remains the cornerstone in accurately diagnosing childhood osteomyelitis.

Main Messages

- Imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis.
- Cooperation between the clinician and radiologist is a very important aspect of making the diagnosis.
- The initial imaging modality in childhood osteomyelitis is conventional imaging.
- Normal conventional imaging does not exclude osteomyelitis.

### Diagnosis and management of acute osteoarticular infections: summary of new guidelines [^b569f6ca]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) and acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) are among the most common invasive bacterial infections in otherwise healthy children. The diagnosis of AHO and ABA requires a high index of suspicion in children presenting with fever and musculoskeletal pain and judiciously chosen laboratory and imaging studies. Choosing the appropriate empirical antibiotic requires familiarity with local susceptibility patterns, especially for Staphylococcus aureus. Typical antibiotic duration for osteoarticular infection is 2–4 weeks depending on the type of infection, response to therapy, and presence of complications. Transitioning from parenteral to oral antibiotics is guided by clinical and laboratory evidence of resolving infection. This review will provide an overview of the recommendations contained in the 2 recently published guidelines for the management of AHO and ABA.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^dfc93750]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

The consortium that established the WikiGuidelines Charter consisted of 63 participants from 8 countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. These participants included physicians, pharmacists, and microbiologists with expertise in general internal and hospital medicine, pediatrics, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology.

The participants addressed 7 questions regarding the diagnosis and management of pyogenic osteomyelitis but found data sufficient to establish clear recommendations for only 2: oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy. In contrast, 5 questions were addressed with clinical reviews in the absence of high-quality data: diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis, management of osteomyelitis underlying pressure ulcers, appropriate timing of empirical therapy, rational selection of antimicrobial options, and use of serial biomarkers or imaging studies to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Dealing with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: a practical approach [^edc4554f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Non-Bacterial Osteomyelitis (CNO) is a rare inflammatory disorder not related to infectious disease. It was first described in 1972 by Giedion et al. as a symmetric multifocal bone lesions; later, in 1980, Bjorksten B et al. first used the term CNO in order to identify a clinical condition which is characterized by recurring episodes or persisting presence of chronic sterile osteomyelitis. Multiple names have been used in literature to describe this disorder; these include chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) in cases with extended multifocal involvement (often symmetric) and synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO), which usually manifests in adolescent and adult patients and which distinguishes for skin involvement. The terms CRMO and CNO are often used interchangeably. Although CNO is still considered a rare disorder, its incidence is probably underestimated. In fact, in a single center retrospective study, it has been recently demonstrated that the incidence of CNO is similar to infectious osteomyelitis. For these reasons, in absence of standardized diagnostic work out and treatment guidelines, it is important to provide some clinical practical suggestion about the every-day clinical management of CNO patients.

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment… [^fe4c7c44]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to infection; it may be acute or chronic. Symptoms of acute osteomyelitis include pain, fever, and edema of the affected site, and patients typically present without bone necrosis in days to weeks following initial infection. Chronic osteomyelitis develops after months to years of persistent infection and may be characterized by the presence of necrotic bone and fistulous tracts from skin to bone. 1, 2 Osteomyelitis is further classified by mechanism of infection as hematogenous or nonhematogenous. With hematogenous osteomyelitis, bacteria are seeded into bone secondary to a bloodstream infection and the condition is most common in children, older adults, and immunocompromised populations. 1–3 Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis occurs from direct inoculation in the setting of surgery or trauma or with spread from contiguous soft tissue and joint infections. 1, 2.

Clinical Features The clinical presentation of nonhematogenous osteomyelitis varies and symptoms are often non-specific. Signs and symptoms common to all sub-types may include pain, edema, and erythema. Acute osteomyelitis may present with a more rapid onset of symptoms and is more likely to be associated with fever. Systemic symptoms are not common in chronic osteomyelitis, and the presence of fistulous tracts from skin to bone is diagnostic. Long-standing, nonhealing ulcers and nonhealing fractures may also be associated with chronic osteomyelitis. Hematogenous osteomyelitis often presents similarly to nonhematogenous disease. The most common form of hematogenous osteomyelitis is vertebral; patients often have back or neck pain and muscle tenderness, sometimes followed by fever. Hematogenous osteomyelitis may also occur in the sternoclavicular, pelvic, and long bones.

Diagnosis A diagnosis of osteomyelitis should be considered in any patient with acute onset or progressive worsening of musculoskeletal pain accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, lethargy, and irritability. Constitutional symptoms do not always occur in adults, especially in the setting of immunocompromise. The index of suspicion for osteomyelitis should be higher in patients with underlying conditions, including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, chronic or ulcerated wounds, history of recent trauma, sickle cell disease, history of implanted orthopedic hardware, or a history or suspicion of intravenous drug use.

### Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis: bone, bugs, and surgery [^202ae45f]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis, or inflammation of bone, is most commonly caused by invasion of bacterial pathogens into the skeleton. Bacterial osteomyelitis is notoriously difficult to treat, in part because of the widespread antimicrobial resistance in the preeminent etiologic agent, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus Bacterial osteomyelitis triggers pathological bone remodeling, which in turn leads to sequestration of infectious foci from innate immune effectors and systemically delivered antimicrobials. Treatment of osteomyelitis therefore typically consists of long courses of antibiotics in conjunction with surgical debridement of necrotic infected tissues. Even with these extreme measures, many patients go on to develop chronic infection or sustain disease comorbidities. A better mechanistic understanding of how bacteria invade, survive within, and trigger pathological remodeling of bone could therefore lead to new therapies aimed at prevention or treatment of osteomyelitis as well as amelioration of disease morbidity. In this minireview, we highlight recent developments in our understanding of how pathogens invade and survive within bone, how bacterial infection or resulting innate immune responses trigger changes in bone remodeling, and how model systems can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets. We review the current state of osteomyelitis epidemiology, diagnostics, and therapeutic guidelines to help direct future research in bacterial pathogenesis.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^95d8e327]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An important limitation of traditional clinical guidelines is the frequent dissociation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. As a result, some past guideline recommendations have endorsed harmful care, which was only subsequently recognized when high-quality, prospective controlled trials were conducted. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach, called WikiGuidelines, to establish clear recommendations only when high-quality, hypothesis-confirming evidence is available (see group charter in Supplement 1).

Our initial social media poll revealed a desire for renewed guidance on a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pyogenic osteomyelitis occurs at a rate of approximately 20 cases per 100 000 person-years, with rates rising among patients with diabetes and older patients, as well as those with prosthetic joints. In low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), osteomyelitis may be more common in younger patients as a result of traumatic injury. Nevertheless, the global economic burden of osteomyelitis is considerable for high-income countries and LMIC.,

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease, with the earliest documented case in an unfortunate, 250-million-year-old dimetredon with a fractured spinal shaft. In the modern era, radiography, surgical methods, and antibiotics have revolutionized its management. However, these successful interventions have resulted in long-standing diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms that have guided treatment despite lacking strong evidence, including the need for diagnostic x-rays and intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for all patients. Recent studies have begun to challenge these dogmas. This guideline focuses on data regarding management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults (see Supplement 2 for the complete guidelines).

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy timing relative to invasive diagnostics in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — directive and rationale: The clinical question asks whether antibiotics should be initiated "before invasive diagnostic procedures" or withheld until after. For "children with presumed AHO who are ill-appearing or have a rapidly progressive infection", the guideline states "we recommend starting empiric antimicrobial therapy immediately rather than withholding antibiotics until" invasive diagnostic procedures. The panel further notes that "knowledge of the pathogen and its susceptibility pattern often simplifies treatment decisions" and that "the decision to perform an aspiration or biopsy procedure for diagnostic purposes and its timing should be considered on a case-by-case basis".

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^736a9dd9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

WikiGuidelines represent a novel approach to guideline construction, clearly delineating evidenced-based recommendations from opinions based on lower-quality data. Resulting changes in management of pyogenic osteomyelitis include recognizing the low value and high burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients, reducing the routine ordering of low value, low accuracy blood biomarkers, increasing adoption of oral therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest necessary for optimizing cure.

These guidelines are based on published data available as of March 1, 2022. Clinicians who believe other evidence should be considered may contact any of the authors to initiate possible revisions, which the authors intend to complete in close to real-time. The authors understand that no clinical trial can extrapolate to all possible patient care scenarios. Thus, we expect that these guidelines should not establish medicolegal standards of care or replace clinician judgment for individual patients.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis [^5f3b1ecd]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or soft tissue infection (excluding spine and diabetic foot): 2022 update [^71af257e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections involve bones, joints, and soft tissues. These infections are a common clinical scenario in both outpatient and emergent settings. Although radiography provides baseline findings, a multimodality approach is often implemented to provide more detailed information on the extent of infection involvement and complications. MRI with intravenous contrast is excellent for the evaluation of musculoskeletal infections and is the most sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis. MRI, CT, and ultrasound can be useful for joint and soft tissue infections. When MRI or CT is contraindicated, bone scans and the appropriate utilization of other nuclear medicine scans can be implemented for aiding in the diagnostic imaging of infection, especially with metal hardware and arthroplasty artifacts on MRI and CT. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^ea351376]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a novel methodology using collaborative research coordinated online be successfully applied to the development of a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis?

Findings

This consensus statement and systematic review using a novel WikiGuidelines methodology addresses 7 questions regarding the management of osteomyelitis, resulting in the establishment of 2 clear recommendations (concerning oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy) and 5 clinical reviews that outline a present lack of adequate, hypothesis-confirming data.

Meaning

These results suggest that this novel, egalitarian methodology enables a clear separation of established care standards based on hypothesis-confirming evidence from practice preferences that are based on lower quality or no evidence.

### A clinico-radiological review of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis in paediatrics, adolescents, and adults: demystifying a forgotten differential [^911aa294]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as non-bacterial osteitis, is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown aetiology that primarily occurs in the paediatric population, although rare cases of adult-onset disease also exist. CNO has non-specific clinical and radiological presentations, and the affected population often present with bone pain of insidious onset secondary to sterile bony inflammation that can be associated with swelling, focal tenderness, and warmth at the affected sites. The pattern of bony involvement appears to be dependent on the age of onset, with adults frequently having axial skeletal lesions and children and adolescents often being affected in the appendicular skeletal sites. CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion, and imaging is heavily relied on to identify and characterise the bony lesions in addition to exclude diseases that can mimic CNO. Magnetic resonance imaging is often the reference standard with biochemical and histopathological findings being complementary. Although combining imaging methods can be used to facilitate the diagnosis, a single technique could be adequate depending on the clinical picture. Given the relatively rare incidence of CNO, limited awareness of the disease among care providers, and its similarity in clinical and radiological presentation to various bony diseases, there are often long delays in diagnosis, with adults being unfavourably affected compared to paediatrics and adolescents. This review of CNO will describe the condition, overview its clinical presentation, highlight the radiological features, and emphasise clinical pearls that can aid in diagnosis and ruling out the mimics.

### Charcot arthropathy versus osteomyelitis: evaluation and management [^4e12c398]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Charcot arthropathy of the foot and ankle is a severe complication of peripheral neuropathy and is most commonly seen in the developed world in association with diabetes mellitus. Correct diagnosis and differentiation from osteomyelitis of the foot and ankle are critical to guide treatment. It can exist concomitantly with osteomyelitis, typically in the setting of an advanced midfoot ulcer. Simple plain radiographs and contrasted MRI studies often yield inconclusive or confusing data. Correct use of imaging studies and a clinical algorithm can be effective tools to help make accurate and early diagnoses and guide clinical interventions for these conditions.

Background

Disease entity, incidence and clinical significance

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO, often synonymous with non-bacterial osteitis, NBO) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease. The exact etiology is currently unknown. Giedion first described the disease entity in 1972. Later, the definition of CNO was extended to include chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Imaging has played an important role since the time of first description (see for an overview). The incidence of CNO is assumed low with, e.g. 0.4 per 100,000 children per year in Germany. However, in spite of therapy, the relapse rate of symptoms with unfavorable outcomes is high. Increasing awareness of the disease may shorten time to diagnosis. The typical age of first manifestation is 9 to 11 years. The disease is extremely unusual in infancy. Girls are more frequently affected than boys, and there seems to be no difference in ethnicity. An association with the so-called SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulose, hyperostosis, osteitis) has been suspected for many years. A recently published study suggests a similar disease entity, incidence and course of both diseases. On the other hand, low current awareness of the disease might lead to considerable delays between the onset of symptoms and medical diagnosis, which is typically given as 2 years for children. Attempts should be made to diagnose the disease as early as possible, since early therapy can lead to better chances of recovery.

Keep in mind/key point: CNO/CRMO — might be unreported — delay in therapy

From the clinical point of view, CNO is an important differential diagnosis, which should not be missed. Traditionally, diagnosis of CNO is made by combining assessment of clinical symptoms, laboratory changes, and imaging, with biopsy often performed to exclude bacterial osteomyelitis or malignancy. Clinical symptoms are non-specific and associated with regional pain (mainly continuous and after exertion) and occasional accompanying swelling. Clinical symptoms manifest in a typical distribution of affected body regions and bones. In particular, the long tubular bones of the lower extremity, the vertebral bodies, the clavicles and the mandibula are most commonly affected. Symmetric involvement is considered characteristic for CNO. However, studies show that the disease can also be asymmetric. Changes in laboratory values (like C-reactive protein (CrP) or blood sedimentation rate (BSG)) are variable and can be raised or normal.

PIDS/IDSA 2021 pediatric AHO — management of nonresponse or relapse: For children either experiencing primary treatment failure or early or late recurrence of AHO, clinicians should assess the adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen (spectrum of activity, dosage and penetration to the site of infection, and adherence) before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or to restart antimicrobials (Good practice statement). Clinicians should reassess the need for surgical intervention for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes (Good practice statement). Comment notes that the accuracy of the diagnosis of AHO may need to be reconsidered, especially in culture-negative cases.

### Validating the probe-to-bone test and other tests for diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot [^d1e3ed1c]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In Spain, amputations due to osteomyelitis are performed each year in 46.1 of every 100,000 individuals with diabetes. In diabetic patients, approximately two-thirds of all amputations are preceded by the infection of a foot ulcer. However, the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot continues to be a challenge, and we believe that there is a need for more studies validating the different diagnostic methods available. There is also a clear need for a safe, rapid, and efficient diagnostic protocol designed to optimize the therapeutic approach and improve the prognosis in these patients.

The early suspicion of osteomyelitis is essentially clinical and is based on detection of the presence of signs and symptoms of infection, although many patients have no typical local signs. Even in the absence of clinical signs, most infected chronic ulcers of the diabetic foot have underlying osteomyelitis. A lack of clinical signs can lead to a delay in diagnosing the initial stages of infection.

The plain X-ray is not useful for detecting bone infection in the first 2 weeks. Bone abnormalities can generally not be seen until bone mineral density drops to 35–50% of that of normal adjacent bone. Moreover, subtle changes at the onset of osteomyelitis are not easily distinguished from other changes that occur in the feet of these patients due to their neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease.

The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is routinely performed to detect, using a blunt instrument, palpable bone through the ulcer, indicating osteomyelitis. However, this test has been validated only in a few previous studies, and there is currently no consensus on a standardized protocol for the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The present study provides data on the validity of the clinical tests most frequently used to detect this disease.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic infection [^b24813a4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

High-energy penetrating extremity injuries are often associated with severe open fractures that have varying degrees of soft-tissue contamination and tenuous soft-tissue coverage. The result is a relatively high prevalence of chronic osteomyelitis compared with that in civilian trauma patients. Diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis requires a careful history and thorough physical and radiographic examinations. Cross-sectional imaging can help delineate the extent of bony involvement, and scintigraphy can be used as a diagnostic tool and to gauge response to treatment. Clinical staging also directs surgical management. Adequacy of débridement remains the most important clinical predictor of success; thus, adopting an oncologic approach to complete (ie, wide) excision is important. Reconstruction can be safely performed by a variety of methods; however, proper staging and patient selection remain critical to a successful outcome. Although systemic and depot delivery of antibiotics plays a supporting role in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, the ideal dosing regimens, and the duration of treatment, remain controversial.

### Treating osteomyelitis: antibiotics and surgery [^0b100d0a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory disorder of bone caused by infection leading to necrosis and destruction. It can affect all ages and involve any bone. Osteomyelitis may become chronic and cause persistent morbidity. Despite new imaging techniques, diagnosis can be difficult and often delayed. Because infection can recur years after apparent "cure", "remission" is a more appropriate term.

Methods

The study is a nonsystematic review of literature.

Results

Osteomyelitis usually requires some antibiotic treatment, usually administered systemically but sometimes supplemented by antibiotic-containing beads or cement. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. Chronic osteomyelitis, often accompanied by necrotic bone, usually requires surgical therapy. Unfortunately, evidence for optimal treatment regimens or therapy durations largely based upon expert opinion, case series, and animal models. Antimicrobial therapy is now complicated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Without surgical resection of infected bone, antibiotic treatment must be prolonged (≥ 4 to 6 weeks). Advances in surgical technique have increased the potential for bone (and often limb) salvage and infection remission.

Conclusions

Osteomyelitis is best managed by a multidisciplinary team. It requires accurate diagnosis and optimization of host defenses, appropriate anti-infective therapy, and often bone débridement and reconstructive surgery. The antibiotic regimen must target the likely (or optimally proven) causative pathogen, with few adverse effects and reasonable costs. The authors offer practical guidance to the medical and surgical aspects of treating osteomyelitis.

### Osteomyelitis in long bones [^1467dcc4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis in long bones remains challenging and expensive to treat, despite advances in antibiotics and new operative techniques. Plain radiographs still provide the best screening for acute and chronic osteomyelitis. Other imaging techniques may be used to determine diagnosis and aid in treatment decisions. The decision to use oral or parenteral antibiotics should be based on results regarding microorganism sensitivity, patient compliance, infectious disease consultation, and the surgeon's experience. A suppressive antibiotic regimen should be directed by the results of cultures. Standard operative treatment is not feasible for all patients because of the functional impairment caused by the disease, the reconstructive operations, and the metabolic consequences of an aggressive therapy regimen. Operative treatment includes debridement, obliteration of dead space, restoration of blood supply, adequate soft-tissue coverage, stabilization, and reconstruction.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children — late relapse following appropriate antibiotic and surgical therapy is uncommon, generally < 1% to 2%. In a child who presents with apparent late relapse, the first step is to determine whether the symptoms or signs are due to bacterial osteomyelitis versus another etiology. Reassessment of the adequacy of the antibiotic regimen and adherence to the prescribed course is a starting point, and imaging studies (plain radiographs and/or MRI, depending on the presentation) should be obtained. Bone biopsy or other invasive technique to examine and culture involved bone(s), including histopathologic evaluation, may be helpful, and surgical debridement of sequestrum and involucrum, when present, may be needed.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^b2fa0013]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Need for the guideline

The Paget Association and other supporting organizations identified a need for a new guideline that was evidence based, patient focused, and that considered all of the available evidence. This guideline differs from previous guidelines published on this subject 58, 59, 60 in that we considered both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options; in that we had patient representation on the guideline development group and sought feedback from patients in the peer‐review process; and in that we have provided information on the key questions used to develop the guideline, as well as details of the search strategy and numbers of publications that were reviewed for each key question.

Remit of the guideline

The remit of the guideline was to provide patient‐centered, evidence‐based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of classical PDB in adults. The guideline focused on classical PDB and did not consider the diagnosis or management of rare PDB‐like syndromes.

We evaluated tools for the diagnosis of PDB and evaluation of disease extent, the effects of bisphosphonates and other drug treatments on various clinical outcomes, the predictors of treatment response, and the effects of nonpharmacological treatments. Because of limitations in the evidence base, we were unable to evaluate how well imaging techniques and biochemical tests performed in differentiating PDB from other conditions such as hyperostosis frontalis interna, chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, and osteosclerotic metastases or in evaluating the clinical role and performance of invasive techniques like bone biopsy in differential diagnosis. That being said, clinical experience indicates that PDB can usually be differentiated quite easily from other conditions by the patient's clinical characteristics and the typical appearances of the disease on radiographic and scintigraphic examination. 61

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^28bf56fa]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To construct a clinical guideline for pyogenic osteomyelitis management, with a new standard of evidence to resolve the gap between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence, through the use of a novel open access approach utilizing social media tools.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review study used a novel approach from the WikiGuidelines Group, an open access collaborative research project, to construct clinical guidelines for pyogenic osteomyelitis. In June 2021 and February 2022, authors recruited via social media conducted multiple PubMed literature searches, including all years and languages, regarding osteomyelitis management; criteria for article quality and inclusion were specified in the group's charter. The GRADE system for evaluating evidence was not used based on previously published concerns regarding the potential dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Instead, the charter required that clear recommendations be made only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were drafted to discuss pros and cons of care choices. Both clear recommendations and clinical reviews were planned with the intention to be regularly updated as new data become available.

Findings

Sixty-three participants with diverse expertise from 8 countries developed the group's charter and its first guideline on pyogenic osteomyelitis. These participants included both nonacademic and academic physicians and pharmacists specializing in general internal medicine or hospital medicine, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology. Of the 7 questions addressed in the guideline, 2 clear recommendations were offered for the use of oral antibiotic therapy and the duration of therapy. In addition, 5 clinical reviews were authored addressing diagnosis, approaches to osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer, timing for the administration of empirical therapy, specific antimicrobial options (including empirical regimens, use of antimicrobials targeting resistant pathogens, the role of bone penetration, and the use of rifampin as adjunctive therapy), and the role of biomarkers and imaging to assess responses to therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

The WikiGuidelines approach offers a novel methodology for clinical guideline development that precludes recommendations based on low-quality data or opinion. The primary limitation is the need for more rigorous clinical investigations, enabling additional clear recommendations for clinical questions currently unresolved by high-quality data.

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^bbb8ac3b]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis can be difficult to diagnose and there has previously not been a prospective approach to identify all children in a defined geographic area. The aim of this study was to assess the annual incidence of osteomyelitis in children, describe the patient and disease characteristics in those with acute (< 14 days disease duration) and subacute osteomyelitis (≥ 14 days disease duration), and differentiate osteomyelitis patients from those with other acute onset musculoskeletal features.

Methods

In a population-based Norwegian study physicians were asked to refer all children with suspected osteomyelitis. Children with osteomyelitis received follow-up at six weeks, six months and thereafter as long as clinically needed.

Results

The total annual incidence rate of osteomyelitis was 13 per 100 000 (acute osteomyelitis 8 and subacute osteomyelitis 5 per 100 000). The incidence was higher in patients under the age of 3 than in older children (OR 2.9, 95%: CI 2.3–3.7). The incidence of non-vertebral osteomyelitis was higher than the incidence of vertebral osteomyelitis (10 vs. 3 per 100 000; p = .002). Vertebral osteomyelitis was more frequent in girls than in boys (OR 7.0, 95%: CI 3.3–14.7). ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr had the highest positive predictive laboratory value to identify osteomyelitis patients at 26% and MRI had a positive predictive value of 85%. Long-bone infection was found in 16 (43%) patients. ESR, CRP, white blood cell count, neutrophils and platelet count were higher for patients with acute osteomyelitis than for patients with subacute osteomyelitis. Subacute findings on MRI and doctor's delay were more common in subacute osteomyelitis than in acute osteomyelitis patients. Blood culture was positive in 26% of the acute osteomyelitis patients and was negative in all the subacute osteomyelitis patients.

Conclusion

The annual incidence of osteomyelitis in Norway remains high. ESR values and MRI scan may help to identify osteomyelitis patients and differentiate acute and subacute osteomyelitis.

### Osteomyelitis [^3419874d]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Bone and joint infections are painful for patients and frustrating for both them and their doctors. The high success rates of antimicrobial therapy in most infectious diseases have not yet been achieved in bone and joint infections owing to the physiological and anatomical characteristics of bone. The key to successful management is early diagnosis, including bone sampling for microbiological and pathological examination to allow targeted and long-lasting antimicrobial therapy. The various types of osteomyelitis require differing medical and surgical therapeutic strategies. These types include, in order of decreasing frequency: osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection (after trauma, surgery, or insertion of a joint prosthesis); that secondary to vascular insufficiency (in diabetic foot infections); or that of haematogenous origin. Chronic osteomyelitis is associated with avascular necrosis of bone and formation of sequestrum (dead bone), and surgical debridement is necessary for cure in addition to antibiotic therapy. By contrast, acute osteomyelitis can respond to antibiotics alone. Generally, a multidisciplinary approach is required for success, involving expertise in orthopaedic surgery, infectious diseases, and plastic surgery, as well as vascular surgery, particularly for complex cases with soft-tissue loss.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^cbefb98f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on the results of recent studies, the current approach to pyogenic osteomyelitis and PJI management can increasingly incorporate newer diagnostic and therapeutic concepts. Such changes include recognizing the low value and high cost and burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients with possible osteomyelitis, reducing or eliminating the routine ordering of low-value, low-accuracy blood biomarkers (eg, inflammatory markers), increasing adoption of oral step-down therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest established to be necessary for optimizing cure in RCTs (eg, not more than 6 weeks for osteomyelitis without a prosthetic implant, 12 weeks for PJI treated with DAIR). These changes incorporate considerations of high value care and implementation in LMIC and resource-constrained settings, and thus are applicable across diverse care environments.

Limitations

The main limitation of this study was that the establishment of only 2 clear recommendations highlights the need for additional high-quality studies of osteomyelitis. In particular, studies are needed regarding new approaches to diagnostics; to elucidate the comparative effectiveness of various antimicrobial options, including adjunctive rifampin or anaerobic therapy; to identify which patients are more likely to relapse after completion of therapy; to further clarify antibiotic durations of therapy; to define the role and optimal methodologies of surgical management; and to define the role of nonantimicrobial adjunctive strategies (eg, hyperbaric oxygen therapy). We also seek to incorporate authors from LMIC countries in future revisions to ensure the WikiGuidelines are broadly applicable to these settings.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^5945a176]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — timing of empiric antibiotics and obtaining cultures — is guided as follows: Delaying the administration of antimicrobial agents for up to 48 to 72 hours may be reasonable if this allows desired cultures of bone or other tissues to be obtained, with observation when antibiotics are intentionally delayed; the child should be observed for signs of potential local or systemic progression of the infection, and the location and frequency of assessment are determined on a case-by-case basis. A delay of greater than 48 to 72 hours is more difficult to justify, and if the blood culture becomes positive for a likely pathogen while waiting for a diagnostic procedure, antibiotics can be started without further delay. Observational data indicate that obtaining invasive cultures up to 24 to 48 hours after the initiation of antibiotics does not appear to impact the rate of positive bone culture results and, based on these data, the need to delay therapy until desired cultures are obtained may be less important than generally thought. An intentional, but cautious, delay may be particularly helpful in children who are not systemically ill-appearing and when the presentation is indolent (e.g., symptoms present for 7 to 14 days with no or minimal progression) or not characteristic of AHO caused by S. aureus or when uncommon etiologies are suspected; blood cultures can usually be obtained prior to antibiotics and may offer a modest chance of establishing a microbiologic diagnosis.

### Antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks versus 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled trial [^49e2d912]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Duration of treatment for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis is mainly based on expert recommendation rather than evidence. We aimed to establish whether 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.

Methods

In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with microbiologically confirmed pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis and typical radiological features from 71 medical care centres across France. Patients were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks or 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment (physician's choice in accordance with French guidelines) by a computer-generated randomisation list of permuted blocks, stratified by centre. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were classified as cured at 1 year by a masked independent validation committee, analysed by intention to treat. Non-inferiority would be declared if the proportion of cured patients assigned to 6 weeks of treatment was not less than the proportion of cured patients assigned to 12 weeks of treatment, within statistical variability, by an absolute margin of 10%. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2006-000951-18, and Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00764114.

Findings

Between Nov 15, 2006, and March 15, 2011, 359 patients were randomly assigned, of whom six in the 6-week group and two in the 12-week group were excluded after randomisation. 176 patients assigned to the 6-week treatment regimen and 175 to the 12-week treatment regimen were analysed by intention to treat. 160 (90.9%) of 176 patients in the 6-week group and 159 (90.9%) of 175 of those in the 12-week group met the criteria for clinical cure. The difference between the groups (0.05%, 95% CI -6.2 to 6.3) showed the non-inferiority of the 6-week regimen when compared with the 12-week regimen. 50 patients in the 6-week group and 51 in the 12-week group had adverse events, the most common being death (14 [8%] in the 6-week group vs 12 [7%] in the 12-week group), antibiotic intolerance (12 [7%] vs 9 [5%]), cardiorespiratory failure (7 [4%] vs 12 [7%]), and neurological complications (7 [4%] vs 3 [2%]).

Interpretation

6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is not inferior to 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment with respect to the proportion of patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis cured at 1 year, which suggests that the standard antibiotic treatment duration for patients with this disease could be reduced to 6 weeks.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children — incidence and presentation: The incidence of AHO in children ranges from 1.2 to 13 cases per 100 000 children per year and may vary as virulent pathogen strains emerge and then wane over time. In children, AHO occurs most frequently in the long bones (eg, femur, tibia, and humerus), but 10% to 25% of cases involve short or non-tubular bones. Most of the cases involve a single bone, but about 5% involve multiple bones. Most of the children with AHO present within 1 week of the onset of symptoms, but some cases are more indolent.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — monitoring response to treatment: In children with suspected or confirmed AHO receiving antimicrobial therapy, we suggest performing sequential monitoring of CRP in addition to serial clinical evaluation to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation and low certainty of evidence).

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^c3bc0ff1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for vertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to biopsy and culture, IDSA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider sending appropriately stored specimens for fungal and mycobacterial cultures and bacterial NAAT, if aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures reveal no growth in patients with suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^87aa691b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

IDSA native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) guideline methodology — panel composition, literature review, evidence grading, consensus development, and conflicts of interest — are described as follows: A panel of 11 experts, including specialists in infectious diseases, spine orthopedic surgery, and neuroradiology, was convened, and among the 11 panel members, 9 are from the United States, 1 is from Europe, and 1 is from the Middle East. The panel identified 13 clinical questions and assigned 3 different groups, divided into the Diagnosis, Management, and Follow-up sections, to draft responses. The search looked at publications from 1970 to December 2014. The guideline followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system recommended by IDSA, in which the assigned strength of a recommendation is either "strong" or "weak", and high-quality evidence does not necessarily lead to strong recommendations; conversely, strong recommendations can arise from low-quality evidence if one can be confident that the desired benefits clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences. For consensus development, panel members met in person twice during the 2010 and 2012 IDSA annual meetings and participated in 9 teleconferences. All members complied with the IDSA policy regarding conflicts of interest, and no limiting conflicts were identified.

### Imaging in non-bacterial osteomyelitis in children and adolescents: diagnosis, differential diagnosis and follow-up-an educational review based on a literature survey and own clinical experiences [^7750db0c]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

All studies that used MRI and other imaging modalities described a significantly higher lesion detection rate with MRI compared to conventional radiography and bone scintigraphy. Most studies reported asymptomatic lesions that were detected only by MRI. This underscores the need and the utility of whole-body MRI in diagnosing CNO.

The site of lesions was specified in 7/15 studies. Only some of the studies that used other imaging modalities mentioned the lesion site in MRI. One study reported only lesions of the mandible; it is known that the lower jaw, along with the temporomandibular joint, can be affected, especially in older children.

CNO lesions show a high predilection for three specific anatomic locations: around the knee (femora, tibiae, fibulae), pelvis (including sacrum and hip) and spine. Bone marrow alterations within the hands and feet can pose a diagnostic dilemma, as physiologic patchy bone marrow signal occur frequently at these locations. Typical patterns of CNO/CMRO involvement in whole-body MRI were first described by von Kalle et al. These findings also include transphyseal extension with involvement of the metaphysis and epiphysis, periostitis, surrounding soft tissue changes or joint effusion (which may be missed by conventional radiography).

Falip et al. published a longitudinal case series review in 2013 showing many examples of CNO lesions on radiography and MRI. Additionally, a diagnostic strategy was presented as a flowchart based on clinical data, laboratory results and imaging results, focused on whole-body MRI; herein, the authors suggest a therapeutic test with follow-up in patients with results highly suspicious for CNO (multifocal lesions in typical sites such as long bone metaphysis, spine and clavicle, as well as findings of physeal widening). Biopsy was suggested for atypical findings such as solitary lesion or multifocal atypical lesions.

Keep in mind/Key point: hallmarks of CNO — multifocality — specific pattern with three "hot regions"

Where specified (9/15) all studies applied STIR or TIRM sequences. Three out of 9 studies included contrast-enhanced series, and 2/9 studies performed Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). Leclair et al. performed whole-body MRI with STIR and diffusion weighted sequences in 16 children with CNO; they reported increased signal within CNO lesions with corresponding increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Diffusion weighting can be helpful in distinguishing between benign inflammatory processes and malignancy.
