## Question

Monocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate monocytosis and determine whether it reflects reactive disease, clonal hematopoiesis, oligomonocytic CMML, or overt CMML, and how to act on that information. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true monocytosis and excluding spurious counts. Then, I should assess for reactive causes. Next, I will examine clonal markers, bone marrow features, and flow cytometry to separate CMML mimics. After that, I should risk-stratify and plan management. Finally, I need to ensure follow-up for pre-CMML states and outline red flags requiring urgent referral [^1166VEcB] [^115WGPTw].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality: I need a CBC with differential and a peripheral smear to verify that the absolute monocyte count is persistently ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L with monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of leukocytes on at least two occasions separated by at least 3 months, because both WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 adopted this lowered threshold and require persistence, replacing older cutoffs and duration requirements that used to mandate ≥ 1×10⁹/L for at least 3 months [^111Zpa5o] [^115jwtrh]. Wait, let me verify that I am not overlooking transient elevations from sample handling or intercurrent illness; repeating the count after a few weeks helps avoid overcalling a reactive spike as clonal disease [^notfound].

> Next, I should review for reactive causes because I need to ensure I am not attributing a secondary monocytosis to a myeloid neoplasm; chronic infections like TB, endocarditis, and leishmaniasis, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and IBD, and even medication effects like G-CSF can raise monocytes, so a careful history, exam, targeted labs, and imaging if indicated are essential before labeling a clonal process [^113D73zb] [^116KHFLR]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if an infection or autoimmune flare explains the monocytosis, I should treat the underlying condition and recheck counts; persistent monocytosis despite correction of the reactive driver should prompt me to reconsider a clonal process rather than prematurely concluding it is reactive [^notfound].

> If monocytosis persists and reactive causes are excluded, I should confirm or refute clonality with molecular testing; next-generation sequencing panels covering CMML-associated genes (TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, RAS pathway, SETBP1, RUNX1, spliceosome genes) and cytogenetics detect clonal lesions in most CMML and help distinguish CHIP/CCUS/CMUS from overt neoplasm, but I need to check that sensitivity is adequate (ideally detecting down to ~2% VAF for CHIP/CCUS, and considering a higher VAF threshold as supportive for CMML when dysplasia is borderline) [^111Zpa5o] [^112PSuab] [^115G829r]. Wait, I should double-check that I am not overinterpreting isolated DTA mutations in an older adult; these can be age-related CHIP and do not by themselves diagnose CMML without supportive morphologic or immunophenotypic features, whereas spliceosome mutations or multiple hits are more worrisome for myeloid neoplasia and warrant closer follow-up or bone marrow evaluation [^1146Ddau] [^115CueiE].

> I will now examine bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics, since diagnostic dysplasia in at least one lineage in ≥ 10% of cells, along with confirmation of < 20% blasts/promonocytes in blood and marrow, is required for CMML, and cytogenetic abnormalities occur in roughly 30% and support clonality when morphology is equivocal; if dysplasia is absent or minimal, documented clonal molecular or cytogenetic abnormalities can substitute as co-criteria under WHO 2022/ICC 2022 [^111Zpa5o] [^114c4L26]. Hold on, I should verify that promonocytes are counted as blast equivalents; yes, WHO includes promonocytes with blasts in the blast percentage calculation, and exceeding 20% shifts the diagnosis to AML, so I need to ensure accurate blast and promonocyte enumeration on aspirate smears [^111Zpa5o].

> But wait, what if morphology is indeterminate or MPN features cloud the picture; I should order monocyte subset flow cytometry to quantify the classical monocyte fraction (CD14++CD16−), because an expansion to ≥ 94% of total monocytes is highly sensitive and specific for CMML versus reactive monocytosis and helps differentiate CMML from MPNs with monocytosis, although autoimmune disease can occasionally blunt this signal by expanding intermediate monocytes, so I must interpret results in clinical context [^116cpqBx] [^113fLvGx] [^1167ExoL]. I need to ensure the lab uses a validated method and a robust event threshold; multicenter validation confirms the assay's robustness and supports routine use when CMML is suspected [^1173kz2M].

> Now I will synthesize the differential; if persistent monocytosis meets ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L and ≥ 10% with clonal evidence and appropriate morphology, I can diagnose CMML and proceed to staging by blast count and symptom phenotype; if the absolute monocyte count is 0.5–0.9×10⁹/L with supportive clonal/morphologic/flow features, that fits oligomonocytic CMML, which has a favorable prognosis but a meaningful risk of evolution to classical CMML or AML and merits follow-up akin to CMML [^111Zpa5o] [^113artr6] [^111hewSU]. Hmm, wait a minute, if there is monocytosis without diagnostic dysplasia or blasts but with low-level clonal mutations and no flow abnormality, that may be CMUS or CCMUS depending on cytopenias; conversely, if all clonal and morphologic studies are negative and reactive causes remain plausible, idiopathic monocytosis of undetermined significance is reasonable with periodic surveillance [^115G829r] [^1166VEcB]. I should confirm exclusion of BCR-ABL1 and TK fusions such as PDGFRA/B, FGFR1, and PCM1-JAK2 when eosinophilia or atypical features are present because these represent different, TK-inhibitor–responsive entities and are not CMML even if monocytosis is present [^117DXTJj] [^111wmzrQ].

> Next, I should review risk stratification; the Mayo Molecular Model incorporates truncating ASXL1, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelets < 100×10⁹/L, absolute monocyte count > 10×10⁹/L, and circulating immature myeloid cells, assigning low, intermediate-1/2, and high risk with median survival ranging from ~97 months to ~16 months, which helps decide timing of allogeneic stem cell transplantation versus supportive or disease-modifying therapies [^114c4L26]. I should double-check molecular prognosticators: ASXL1 mutation, particularly truncating, confers adverse prognosis, whereas a TET2-mutant without ASXL1 may be favorable, and this should guide transplant timing discussions in higher-risk patients [^114c4L26].

> For management, I need to ensure the plan matches risk and symptoms; lower-risk myelodysplastic-phenotype CMML often benefits from supportive care, ESAs for anemia, and careful monitoring, while proliferative or higher-risk disease warrants cytoreduction with hydroxyurea or hypomethylating agents, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option for appropriately selected intermediate- to high-risk patients, with attention to comorbidities such as renal disease that can complicate transplant eligibility [^114c4L26] [^1149Bnuk]. Hold on, I should verify expectations: current drug therapy is largely palliative and does not reliably modify disease biology, so counseling on goals of care and transplant timelines is essential [^notfound].

> If I diagnose oligomonocytic CMML or CMUS/CCMUS, I should confirm a surveillance plan; reassessing counts and symptoms every 3–6 months, repeating bone marrow if cytopenias worsen or blasts appear, and resequencing if the clone enlarges or new mutations accrue are prudent, given documented evolution to classical CMML or AML in a subset over time [^113artr6] [^1166VEcB]. Let me reconsider: the absolute risk is not trivial, and the presence of multiple mutations or spliceosome lesions strengthens the case for closer follow-up or earlier definitive therapy when appropriate [^115CueiE].

> Finally, I need to ensure red flags trigger urgent action; unexplained persistent monocytosis with cytopenias, splenomegaly, B symptoms, circulating blasts, or concerning molecular features such as ASXL1 mutation should prompt expedited hematology referral, comprehensive molecular testing, and consideration of early transplant evaluation rather than prolonged watchful waiting [^114c4L26] [^115WGPTw]. I should double-check that I have not missed a treatable reactive cause or a TK fusion masquerading as CMML, because addressing those changes management entirely and avoids inappropriate therapy [^117DXTJj].

Monocytosis is defined as an **absolute monocyte count ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L** [^111Zpa5o] and can reflect either clonal or reactive causes. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is the **most common clonal cause** [^112avKrb], with diagnostic criteria requiring persistent monocytosis, dysplasia, and clonal mutations [^114c4L26]; monocyte subset flow cytometry (classical monocytes ≥ 94%) aids diagnosis [^113fLvGx]. Reactive monocytosis arises from infections, autoimmune disease, or inflammation [^113D73zb]; evaluation should include history, examination, and targeted labs to exclude these causes [^113Y9xBJ]. Persistent monocytosis without a reactive cause warrants **bone marrow and molecular testing** [^114GYZTF] to distinguish CMML, oligomonocytic CMML [^116uZG5D], or other myeloid neoplasms [^114fCcLX]. Management is cause-specific: treat reactive causes; for CMML, use risk-adapted therapy, including hypomethylating agents [^114c4L26] and allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high-risk disease [^112avKrb].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

The WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 define monocytosis as an **absolute monocyte count ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L** with monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of leukocytes [^111Zpa5o] [^116uZG5D]. Persistence for ≥ 3 months is required to distinguish transient from chronic monocytosis [^115jwtrh].

---

## Etiology and classification

Monocytosis is broadly classified as **clonal or reactive** [^113YLuYV].

---

### Clonal monocytosis

Clonal monocytosis reflects neoplastic proliferation of monocytes, most commonly due to CMML; other myeloid neoplasms (e.g. MDS, MPN) can also feature monocytosis [^111Zpa5o]. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with **overlapping myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features** [^114c4L26], characterized by persistent monocytosis, dysplasia, and clonal mutations (TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1) [^114c4L26].

---

### Reactive monocytosis

Reactive monocytosis arises from **non-neoplastic processes**, including:

- **Infections**: Tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, brucellosis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, HIV, EBV [^113D73zb] [^116ymMFA].
- **Autoimmune/inflammatory**: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease [^113D73zb] [^116QrMf7].
- **Hematologic**: Recovery from marrow injury, chemotherapy, or cytokine therapy (e.g. G-CSF) [^113D73zb] [^116KHFLR].
- **Solid tumors**: Paraneoplastic monocytosis via cytokine-driven myelopoiesis [^116KHFLR].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to distinguish clonal from reactive monocytosis:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic evaluation** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm persistent monocytosis (≥ 3 months) [^11345bTJ] |
| 2 | Exclude reactive causes (history, exam, infections, autoimmunity, inflammation) [^113Y9xBJ] |
| 3 | Peripheral smear for dysplasia, blasts, eosinophilia [^112ehgtg] |
| 4 | Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for dysplasia, blast count, cytogenetics [^111Zpa5o] |
| 5 | Molecular testing (NGS) for CMML mutations (TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1) [^112PSuab] |
| 6 | Flow cytometry for monocyte subsets (classical monocytes ≥ 94%) [^113fLvGx] |
| 7 | Exclude BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA/B, FGFR1, JAK2 fusions [^1113DPgo] |

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

The clinical significance depends on the **underlying cause**. CMML carries a median survival of 20–40 months [^117UqaPM] and a 15–20% risk of transformation to AML [^114c4L26]. Prognosis is shaped by molecular features (e.g. ASXL1 mutations) [^114c4L26], blast count, and cytogenetics [^113EjUzn]. Reactive monocytosis generally resolves with treatment of the underlying condition and has a favorable prognosis [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Reactive monocytosis**: Treat the underlying infection, autoimmune disease, or inflammatory condition [^notfound].
- **CMML**: Risk-adapted therapy, including hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) for symptomatic or high-risk disease [^114c4L26]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option for eligible high-risk patients [^114c4L26].
- **Oligomonocytic CMML**: Manage similarly to classical CMML with close monitoring and supportive care [^116MZTkX].

---

## Emerging research and controversies

Recent advances include the **lowered monocyte threshold to 0.5×10⁹/L** [^111Zpa5o], incorporation of monocyte subset flow cytometry [^113fLvGx], and expanded molecular panels for clonality assessment [^112PSuab]. Controversies persist regarding the optimal classification of oligomonocytic CMML and pre-CMML states (CHIP, CCUS, CMUS) [^117P7748], and the role of novel targeted therapies remains under investigation [^117TNCvo].

---

Monocytosis is defined as an **absolute monocyte count ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L** [^111Zpa5o] and can reflect clonal or reactive causes. CMML is the most common clonal cause [^notfound], while infections, autoimmune disease, and inflammation drive reactive monocytosis [^113D73zb]. Persistent monocytosis without a reactive cause warrants **bone marrow and molecular testing** [^114GYZTF] to distinguish CMML, oligomonocytic CMML, or other myeloid neoplasms [^111Zpa5o]. Management is cause-specific: treat reactive causes; for CMML, use risk-adapted therapy, including hypomethylating agents [^114c4L26] and allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high-risk disease [^114c4L26].

How I approach chronic myelomonocytic leukemia variants and molecularly defined entities with monocytosis

The diagnosis and management of CMML variants and molecularly defined entities presenting with monocytosis, mimicking CMML, require special attention. These variants can broadly be divided into three categories: (i) oligomonocytic CMML; (ii) CMML associated with a concomitant myeloid neoplasm; and (iii) molecularly defined entities with monocytosis.

Oligomonocytic CMML. This category encompasses patients who present with sustained relative monocytosis (≥ 10% of white blood cells) and absolute monocytosis not meeting current diagnostic criteria for CMML (absolute monocyte count 0.5- < 1.0x10 9 /L). Based on the 2016 WHO classification, these patients would be classified as having either MDS or MDS/MPN-Unclassifiable. Except for an absolute monocyte count of ≥ 1x10 9 /L, if these patients meet other CMML diagnostic criteria, along with a M01 fraction > 94% on monocyte repartitioning flow cytometry, and a molecular signature consistent with CMML (TET2, SRSF2, and ASXL1), I consider them as having oligomonocytic CMML and follow and manage them as such. Over time, several of these patients will have clonal evolution to either CMML or secondary AML.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^1179YNWH]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We identify monocytosis in a substantial proportion of the general aging population. A higher prevalence of CH was found in those with monocytosis than in matched population-based control subjects, especially when the monocytosis was persistent over time. Although not necessarily reflecting a clonal monocyte population, in a fraction of subjects with monocytosis, CH might constitute very early clonal dominance in the development of malignant myelomonocytic disease. Clinical attention seems warranted for cases with spliceosome gene mutations or with multiple mutated genes. Longitudinal studies are needed to track the evolutionary trajectory of cases with monocytosis and age-related CH and decide on the added value of a clinical follow-up for these cases.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115CueiE]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Only a small proportion of older individuals with monocytosis developed a myeloid malignancy. It might be that a long latency period is required for a very early stage of clonal monocytosis to develop into malignant disease. In addition, supported by a higher level of inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other WBC counts, a major proportion of individuals in this study probably suffered from reactive monocytosis despite the presence of CH. Clearly, CH in the presence of monocytosis does not directly imply the presence of a clonal monocyte proliferation with malignant potential. This stresses the fact that mutational screening should not be used as an isolated screening tool to distinguish CMML, oligomonocytic CMML, and other potential CMML prestagesfrom a reactive monocytosis, especially when more liberal criteria (eg, concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 × 10 9 /L) to define a PB monocytosis are applied and other diagnostic criteria are not met. Indeed, this also questions whether all clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis may support a diagnosis of CMML, as it is currently used in the 2016 WHO criteria. For example, we previously described the clonal evolution of a CMML case which was remarkably stable and whose diagnosis could be questioned in hindsight. The combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations, in contrast, was associated with clonal expansion of monocytic cells, which confirms the specificity of this mutational spectrum for myelomonocytic disorders.

Introduction

Monocytes are part of the myeloid lineage that expands with age and represent key players in inflammatory and immune reactions. Normal monocyte values range between 0.3 and 0.9 × 10 9 /L, constituting 2% to 8% of the total white blood cell (WBC) population in peripheral blood (PB). Abnormal production and accumulation of monocytes may occur in numerous conditions. Monocytosis may be explained by inflammatory conditions ("reactive monocytosis"), as present in acute stress, myocardial infarction, chronic infection, systemic inflammation, and autoimmune disorders. Besides secondary causes, PB monocytosis is the defining phenotypic hallmark of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a chronic myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features that occurs almost exclusively in older individuals. In addition, monocytosis may accompany other myeloid malignancies. Current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for CMML define monocytosis as a persistent (≥ 3 months) increase in PB monocyte counts ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L in combination with a relative excess of monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of the WBC count that cannot be explained by secondary causes. Driver gene mutations are detected in the majority of patients with CMML and most frequently involve SRSF2, TET2, and ASXL1 genes, although none of these are CMML-specific. In current WHO criteria, clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis can support a diagnosis of CMML, even in the absence of typical myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative features.

Discussion

This is the first study assessing the occurrence of monocytosis in an unbiased and prospective cohort of community-dwelling individuals. To investigate the potential presence of pre-CMML conditions among older individuals with clonal monocytosis, we studied the relation between monocytosis and clonal hematopoiesis in a nested case-control design. Our results help to distinguish mutational spectra of importance in the context of monocytosis and show that the presence of CH in individuals with monocytosis is not sufficient to diagnose (prephases of) CMML in asymptomatic or community-dwelling individuals.

Monocytosis was detected in a substantial proportion of older individuals, and its prevalence increased with age. CMML is characterized by a strong male predominance, especially with aging. In this population-based cohort, we also observed higher monocyte counts and a higher prevalence of monocytosis in males. The definition of monocytosis was in accordance with current cutoffs used in WHO criteria to define monocytosis in CMML, except for the evaluation of 3-month persistence of monocytosis, the evaluation of which was hampered by the large time interval for follow-up blood counts. When applying less stringent proposed criteria that have been proposed in the literature (eg, monocytosis ≥ 10% of WBC count and ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L) to define mild but relevant monocytosis, we identified a much higher proportion of individuals with monocytosis (up to 12%). The high prevalence of monocytosis according to these criteria indicates that these may not be clinically useful to define prestages of CMML in the absence of other cocriteria.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^114fCcLX]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias (CMML) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte counts in the peripheral blood, accompanied by dysplasia, abnormal proliferation, chromosomal anomalies and somatic mutations of haematopoietic cells. More than 95% of CMML patients harbour somatic mutations. CMML must be separated from other myeloid neoplasms and reactive monocytosis. The clinical presentation of CMML varies, but most frequently shows signs and symptoms of haematopoietic insufficiency or myeloproliferation. Robust instruments are available for assessing the prognosis of patients with CMML, such as the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system molecular. Treatment options for patients with CMML are still inadequate and generally less effective than those for other myeloid neoplasms. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This article explains essential aspects of CMML pathophysiology and provides an overview of diagnostic considerations, prognostic assessment and therapeutic options.

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^116uZG5D]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past half century, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was defined as a myelodysplastic (MD)/myeloproliferative (MP) neoplasm with the hallmark characteristic of peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L, in conjunction with MD and/or MP bone marrow (BM) features.

Because of constant technological advancement and a rapidly evolving knowledge base, preexisting conceptions are being challenged, making the continuous adaptation of disease definitions necessary. In this regard, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) introduced major common changes to the diagnostic criteria of CMML. First, in the presence of additional CMML features, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis was lowered to ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L absolute monocyte count in both classifications, thereby incorporating cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic (OM)-CMML into the diagnosis of CMML. Second, the CMML-0 subgroup was eliminated because of its limited clinical relevance. Finally, in the current classifications, the diagnostic focus is shifted onto recurrent molecular aberrations, thus replacing solely clinical criteria such as persisting monocytosis for ≥ 3 months in the absence of alternative diagnoses.

### Peripheral blood monocytosis is associated with long-term disease severity in pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease [^114ZF9FX]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peripheral blood monocytosis (PBM) is a marker of increased disease severity in adults with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We sought to determine whether PBM serves as a prognostic biomarker in patients with pediatric-onset IBD for a more aggressive long-term disease course when followed into adulthood.

Methods

Patients with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease were identified within an adult tertiary care center, within a consented, prospectively collected natural history disease registry, to compare clinical outcomes between patients with and without PBM from the years 2009 to 2019. Patients demonstrating elevation in PBM at any time defined membership and long-term clinical trajectories were compared with pediatric-onset patients without PBM.

Results

A total of 581 patients with IBD, diagnosed by 18 years of age, were identified for inclusion, of which 440 patients were diagnosed with Crohn disease and 141 with ulcerative colitis. Monocytosis was detected by complete blood cell counts in 40.1% of patients. PBM was associated with steroid and biologic exposure, number of IBD-related surgeries, and increased health care utilization. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, accounting for elevation of inflammatory markers and other values associated with acute disease activity as well as steroid use, showed persistently increased odds of biologic exposure, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, but not surgeries, after detection of monocytosis.

Conclusions

Within patients with pediatric-onset IBD, the sub-cohort with PBM had associated worse clinical outcomes and other markers of increased disease severity.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia [^1124JBo4]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a morphological hybrid between myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterized by clonal monocytosis. Myeloid neoplasm-associated somatic mutations are present in > 90% of patients with CMML but are not diagnostically specific but a subset are prognostically relevant. Current drug therapy in CMML is mostly palliative and not disease-modifying. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment modality in CMML and its timing is determined by formal prognostic models including the recently developed BLAST and BLAST-molecular risk models.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic innovations [^117TNCvo]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Epigenetic dysregulation in CMML leads to myeloid bias and clonal monocytosis. Subsequent acquisition of epigenetic/ transcription factor mutations typically results in dysplastic CMML, whereas signaling mutations are more commonly associated with the more aggressive proliferative CMML. Increased activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in clonal monocytes as well as accumulation of leukemia-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells, causing suppression of the adaptive immune system, drive more severe clinical manifestations with inferior outcomes. Despite active research, there remains an unmet clinical need to improve outcomes for CMML patients. Single-agent therapy fails to alter disease biology and the complex pathophysiology of CMML highlights the need to explore combination strategies, with several clinical trials currently underway.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115pJXXH]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Monocytosis may occur in numerous inflammatory conditions but is also the defining feature of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Clonal somatic mutations detectable in CMML may occur with aging in otherwise healthy individuals, so-called "clonal hematopoiesis" (CH). We investigated whether the combination of CH and monocytosis would represent an early developmental stage of CMML. We studied community-dwelling individuals with monocytosis (≥ 1 × 109/L and ≥ 10% of leukocytes) in the population-based Lifelines cohort (n = 144 676 adults). The prevalence and spectrum of CH were evaluated for individuals ≥ 60 years with monocytosis (n = 167 [0.8%]), and control subjects 1:3 matched for age and sex (n = 501). Diagnoses of hematological malignancies were retrieved by linkage to the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Monocyte counts and the prevalence of monocytosis increased with advancing age. Older individuals with monocytosis more frequently carried CH (50.9% vs 35.5%; P < .001). Monocytosis is associated with enrichment of multiple gene mutations (P = 0.006) and spliceosome mutations (P = 0.007) but not isolated mutated DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1. Persistent monocytosis over 4 years was observed in 30/102 evaluable individuals and associated with a higher prevalence of CH (63%). Myeloid malignancies, including 1 case of CMML, developed in 4 individuals with monocytosis who all carried CH. In conclusion, monocytosis and CH both occur at an older age and do not necessarily reflect clonal monocytic proliferation. In a fraction of older subjects with monocytosis, CH might constitute early clonal dominance in developing malignant myelomonocytic disease. Mutational spectra deviating from age-related CH require attention.

### Monocytosis is a biomarker of severity in inflammatory bowel disease: analysis of a 6-year prospective natural history registry [^116QrMf7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with alterations of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Monocytes respond to inflammation and infection, yet the relationship between monocytosis and IBD severity is not fully understood. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of monocytosis in IBD and the association between monocytosis and disease severity and IBD-related health care utilization.

Methods

We used a multiyear, prospectively collected natural history registry to compare patients with IBD with monocytosis to those without monocytosis, among all patients and by disease type.

Results

A total of 1290 patients with IBD (64.1% with Crohn disease; 35.9% with ulcerative colitis) were included (mean age 46.4 years; 52.6% female). Monocytosis was found in 399 (30.9%) of patients with IBD (29.3% with Crohn disease; 33.9% with ulcerative colitis). Monocytosis was significantly associated with abnormal C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, worse quality of life, active disease, and increased exposure to biologics (all P < 0.001). Compared with patients without monocytosis, patients with monocytosis had a 3-fold increase in annual financial health care charges (median: $127,013 vs. $32,925, P < 0.001) and an increased likelihood of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.5; P < 0.001), IBD-related surgery (AOR, 1.9; P = 0.002), and emergency department (ED) use (AOR, 2.8; P < 0.001). Patients with monocytosis had a shorter time to surgery, hospitalization, and ED visit after stratifying by disease activity (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with IBD with monocytosis, regardless of disease type, are at increased risk for worse clinical outcomes, hospitalization, surgery, and ED use. Peripheral monocytosis may represent a routinely available biomarker of a distinct subgroup with severe disease.

### Clonal monocytosis of renal significance [^1149Bnuk]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Clonal monocytosis reflects a preneoplastic or neoplastic sustained increase in the absolute monocyte count in the absence of reactive causes. Causes of clonal monocytosis include clonal cytopenias with monocytosis and acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a prototypical myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm in adults, characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis. Kidney abnormalities, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, are frequent in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are predictors of worse outcomes. In addition, acute kidney injury/chronic kidney disease often limits eligibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation or enrollment in clinical trials. In this review, we highlight clonal monocytosis-related etiologies that give rise to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, with special emphasis on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and lysozyme-induced nephropathy. Monocytes produce lysozyme, which, in excess, can accumulate in and damage the proximal renal tubular epithelium. Early identification of this etiology and a timely reduction in monocyte counts can salvage kidney function. Other etiologies of kidney injury associated with clonal monocytosis include direct renal infiltration by monocytes, renal extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated glomerulopathy, autoimmune (membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease) and paraneoplastic manifestations, thrombotic microangiopathy, obstructive nephropathy due to myeloproliferation, and urate nephropathy due to tumor lysis syndrome. We propose to group these mechanistic etiologies of kidney injury as clonal monocytosis of renal significance and provide guidance on their diagnosis and management.

### Flow cytometry based monocyte subset analysis accurately distinguishes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from myeloproliferative neoplasms with associated monocytosis [^1167ExoL]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Monocytosis can occur in patients with MPN, especially PV (≈20%) and PMF (≈15%), is associated with poor outcomes, and at diagnosis, can make it difficult to distinguish between MPN and CMML. This has important diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications for affected patients. Our study successfully demonstrates the use of monocyte partitioning by multiparametric flow cytometry to distinguish CMML from MPN with monocytosis. This test when used in addition to bone marrow morphology and molecular studies will help improve our diagnostic accuracy. Given the high prevalence of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in CMML (≈30%), alterations in the MO2 fraction have been described, giving rise to false negative flow cytometry results. This subset of patients' needs further prospective evaluation.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^114B4Htu]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

This population of community-dwelling individuals, as well as the results from this study, are considerably different from the cohort presented by Cargo and colleaguesthat evaluated patients presenting in hematology practice for the evaluation of monocytosis. In that study, individuals with clinically significant monocytosis but not (yet) meeting WHO criteria were found to have a mutational spectrum and clinical outcome indistinguishable from WHO-defined CMML. The median VAF in our study was 2.7%, compared with 39% in the study by Cargo and colleagues. Although various differences in sequencing technique and sensitivity may be noted between these studies, this is unlikely to explain the substantial differences in the mutational spectrum associated with monocytosis. Our cohort comprised unselected community-dwelling individuals for whom monocytosis was detected incidentally at study inclusion, without known associated health complaints. Indeed, there was a relatively low prevalence of accompanying cytopenias compared with diagnosed CMML patients. The clinical study by Cargo and colleagues probably included individuals with a more advanced stage and more suspect of overt clonal myeloid disease. Thus, the meaning of CH in the context of monocytosis presumably depends on the clinical burden of monocytosis and may very well be a continuum of (stepwise) clonal outgrowth and progression.

Results

Age-related changes in monocyte count and the emergence of monocytosis in older individuals

PB monocyte counts were available for 144 676 Lifelines participants. This population included 60 088 men and 84 588 women, with a median follow-up of 8.6 years (range, 0–13.8 years). Higher monocyte counts were observed for male participants across all ages compared with females. Upon aging, an increase in absolute monocyte count was observed in the cohort of individuals ≥ 60 years (Figure 1A). The prevalence of monocytosis, defined as a PB monocyte count ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L and ≥ 10% of total WBC count, increased with advancing age. In total, 167 out of 21 729 (0.8%) evaluable Lifelines participants ≥ 60 years had monocytosis at the study inclusion visit. Consistent with the observed sex differences in monocyte count, there was male predominance in monocytosis prevalence (Figure 1B). PB counts for community-dwelling individuals ≥ 60 years with and without monocytosis are presented in Table 1. Platelet count (P = 0.004) and hemoglobin levels (P < .001) were higher for individuals with monocytosis. Individuals with monocytosis had higher levels of mean corpuscular volume (P = 0.001). Monocytosis further associated with a concomitant increase of total WBC count (P < .001), neutrophil count (P < .001), and also lymphocyte count (P < .001). Finally, monocytosis associated with higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (concentrations (P < .001). Recently, alternative criteria were proposed to define a persistent monocytosis that is suggestive of pre-CMML conditions, including a lower absolute monocyte count or the presence of an absolute but not relative increase in monocytes. When these criteria were applied to our crosssectional community-based cohort, almost half of all individuals (41%) were meeting the proposed cutoff criteria for absolute monocytosis (monocyte count ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L), with a substantial percentage (12%) also having a relative increase in monocyte count ≥ 10% of the total WBC count (Figure 1C).

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^114okR7v]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Mutational screening in this case-control cohort revealed a higher prevalence of CH in community-dwelling individuals with monocytosis, especially in cases with long-term persistent monocytosis. Isolated mutations in genes most commonly involved in age-related CH (DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1) were detected at comparable frequencies in individuals with monocytosis and control subjects. In addition, the combination of monocytosis and CH did not necessarily involve a clonal expansion of mutated monocytes. Thus, although both monocytosis and DTA mutations develop with advancing age, these phenomena are not necessarily related. In contrast, the presence of monocytosis is associated with a higher prevalence of spliceosome mutations. These mutations occur in > 50% of MDS and CMML patients, and aberrant splicing is considered one of the key drivers of MDS and myeloproliferative neoplasm disease pathophysiology. In addition, we identified a significantly higher proportion of individuals with monocytosis carrying combinations of gene mutations. Acquisition of additional mutations may contribute to the expansion of the mutated clone that may eventually transform into malignant disease, including CMML. We propose that individuals with dysregulated monocyte counts in combination with a mutational signature that deviates from common age-related CH may be at risk for an early stage in the development of malignant myeloid disease.

Table 1.
2017, World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

While absolute monocytosis is uncommon in chronic myeloid leukemia, it can occur in BCR-ABL1 p190 isoformdriven disease and, regardless of the presence or absence of a "myelocyte bulge", assessment for BCR-ABL1 fusions by fluorescence in situ hybridization, cytogenetics, and/or molecular techniques should be pursued. Chromosomal translocations/rearrangements involving PDGFRA and PDGFRB can give rise to myeloid neoplasms, often characterized by prominent eosinophilia and responsiveness to imatinib. Among these, PDGFRB -rearranged myeloid neoplasms can be associated with absolute monocytosis (< 1% of all cases morphologically diagnosed as CMML), usually with concomitant eosinophilia, and given their unique responsiveness to imatinib are best classified as molecularly defined neoplasms and not as CMML. More than 20 fusion partner genes have been described with PDGFRB, with t(5;12)(q31-q32; p13), giving rise to the ETV6(TEL)-PDGFRB fusion, being the most common. The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion arising due to the CHIC2 deletion is the most common PDGFRA aberration and is uncommonly associated with monocytosis. While most PDGFRB re-arrangements can be identified by conventional karyotyping, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is karyotypically occult and can only be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or molecular analyses. Similarly, FGFR1 and PCM1-JAK2 rearrangements are very uncommon causes of monocytosis and are more commonly associated with eosinophilia. Monocytosis can occur in the context of other myeloid neoplasms such as MDS and MPN and is associated with poor outcomes in MPN. While monocytosis in MDS can be a reflection of an ongoing evolutionary trajectory to CMML (oligo-monocytic CMML), in MPN, the utilization of monocyte repartitioning flow cytometry (discussed below) and driver mutation status can help differentiate CMML from MPN with monocytosis. Among classical MPN-driver mutations, while JAK2 V617F can occur in 10% of CMML patients, mutations involving MPL and CALR are extremely infrequent and their detection should raise questions with regards to a bona fide CMML diagnosis. Occasionally NPM1 and FLT3 driver mutations are identified in CMML patients with excess blasts (5–19%). For all practical purposes I consider these cases as acute myelomonocytic leukemia in evolution and treat them as such.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^114GYZTF]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

CMML was first described in the early 1970sand has been reported as a preleukaemic state. The model of leukaemic transformation corresponds to that of myelodysplastic syndromes. However, CMML differs from myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) in the obligatory monocyte population that is detectable in the blood at diagnosis. Due to the similarity of CMML and MDS, the French American British classification (FAB) proposalsclassified CMML and MDS as close relatives, thus creating a problem because many people now believe that CMML is just a variant of MDS. However, it has become clear that CMML is more than MDS plus monocytosis, not only based on its clinical presentation but also with regard to genetic alterations and therapeutic problems. The FAB classification proposed an obligatory monocytosis of more than 1000/μL, which was retained over the years until the threshold was lowered to 500/μL in both the WHO classification of 2022and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) classification. In addition, signs of dysplasia in blood and marrow have always been included as characterizing features of CMML. Inspired by the concept of 'oligomonocytic leukaemia', the threshold of 500 monocytes/μL is now used as a defining event in CMML, together with evidence of clonality by the means of detection of somatic mutations or chromosomal aberrations. This proposal solves, at least in part, another problem in the diagnosis of CMML, namely the differentiation against various non‐myeloid diseases with reactive monocytosis, as well as distinction between CMML and some other myeloid malignancies. Table 1 presents a list of differential diagnoses that need to be excluded, especially in those rare cases without proof of clonality. The increasing availability and decreasing cost of DNA sequencing promote investigations of clonality, which either confirm the suspected diagnosis of CMML or, in case of negative findings, point to reactive monocytosis. There is evidence that molecular screening can be performed on peripheral blood cells.

### How I treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^1157YxAQ]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy that may deserve specific management. Defined by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L and monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the white blood cells, this aging-associated disease combines cell proliferation as a consequence of myeloid progenitor hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with myeloid cell dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. The only curative option for CMML remains allogeneic stem cell transplantation. When transplantation is excluded, CMML is stratified into myelodysplastic (white blood cell count < 13 × 10 9 /L) and proliferative (white blood cell count ≥ 13 × 10 9 /L) CMML. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, the management of myelodysplastic CMML is largely inspired from myelodysplastic syndromes, relying on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to cope with anemia, and careful monitoring and supportive care, whereas the management of proliferative CMML usually relies on cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, although ongoing studies will help delineate the role of hypomethylating agents in this patient population. In the presence of excessive blasts and other poor prognostic factors, hypomethylating agents are the preferred option, even though their impact on leukemic transformation and survival has not been proved. The therapeutic choice is illustrated by 4 clinical situations among the most commonly seen. Although current therapeutic options can improve patient's quality of life, they barely modify disease evolution. Improved understanding of CMML pathophysiology will hopefully lead to the exploration of novel targets that potentially would be curative.

Individuals with persistence of monocytosis have a higher prevalence of CH and biased mutational profile

WHO criteria for CMML require the persistence of peripheral monocytosis over a 3-month period. A follow-up for Lifelines participants was available after a median period of 3.8 years and included monocyte counts for n = 102 668. Studying the persistence of monocytosis and its relation to CH was thus limited by the loss to follow-up of potential high-risk cases during this latency period (supplemental Table 2). Among 167 individuals with monocytosis at the study inclusion visit, 102 could be evaluated for long-term persistence of monocytosis (eg, detection of monocytosis at baseline and follow-up visit). In total, 30 out of 102 (29%) evaluable individuals ≥ 60 years had persistence of monocytosis over this period (Figure 3G). We grouped individuals and their respective 1:3 control subjects based on the persistence of monocytosis over time. Prevalence of CH was highest in those with persistent monocytosis over time: 19 (63%) of individuals with persistent monocytosis carried CH, as compared with 28% of matched control subjects (P = 0.001) (Figure 3H and supplemental Figure 4). When following current WHO diagnostic criteria, this would translate into an estimated prevalence of 1.85 in 10.000 for (undiagnosed) CMML in community-dwelling individuals. The highest absolute monocyte counts at baseline visits were found among individuals with persistent monocytosis, although this was not statistically significant (Figure 3I).

### Prognostic significance of monocytosis in patients with myeloproliferative disorders [^113EjUzn]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

Based on clinical and pathological findings, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) differs from other myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders by its hallmark, monocytosis. It is unknown whether the presence of monocytosis and the diagnosis of CMML carry a prognostic significance. The present study aimed to determine whether the survival of patients with CMML differs from that of patients with BCR/ABL-negative CML or Ph(1-), BCR/ABL-unknown CML, once other potentially prognostic variables have been accounted for. The records of 485 patients with myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders [CMML, n = 304; BCR/ABL-negative CML, n = 107; Ph(1-), BCR/ABL unknown, n = 74] were analysed. Of the covariates found to be significantly (P < 0.01) associated with survival in univariate and multivariate analyses, the following remained predictive and adversely associated with survival, after accounting for the influence of other covariates: increasing age, white blood cell count, platelets, bone marrow blasts and cellularity, decreasing hemoglobin, abnormal karyotype, and diagnosis of CMML. The diagnosis of CMML is prognostically significant and independently associated with a shorter survival and a higher risk of death than BCR/ABL-negative CML or Ph(1-) BCR/ABL-unknown CML.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^116KHFLR]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Reactive monocytosis is very common in practice and while viral infections and recovering bone marrow (from injury, drugs or chemotherapy) are frequent causes, sustained reactive monocytosis is more common in chronic infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leishmaniasis and leprosy and in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and mixed connective tissue disorder. Reactive monocytosis can also be seen in the context of metastatic visceral neoplasms, either due to enhanced mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow, or due to increased monopoiesis mediated by CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2).

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^111L2YRy]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of CMML and minimal diagnostic criteria

The diagnostic criteria of CMML, as defined by the WHO, are depicted in Online Supplementary Table S1. Our faculty is of the opinion that these criteria are valid in general for the classical form of CMML, but need adjustments for special variants of CMML. Based on consensus discussion, the following concept is proposed.

The classical form of CMML is defined by the following pre-requisite criteria: (i) persistent (at least 3 months) absolute PB monocytosis (≥ 1×10 9 /L) and relative monocytosis (≥ 10% of PB leukocytes); (ii) exclusion of BCR-ABL1 + leukemia, classical MPN and all other hematologic neoplasms that may serve as a primary source of monocytosis; and (iii) a blast cell count of 0–19% in PB and/or BM smears and exclusion of all (other) histopathological, morphological, phenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic signs that qualify as evidence of AML. In addition, morphological and/or histopathological evidence for diagnostic dysplasia in one or more of the three major BM cell lineages (≥ 10% of megakaryocytes and/or erythroid precursor cells and/or neutrophilic cells) must be present. If dysplasia is absent or not diagnostic (< 10%), the presence of cytogenetic or molecular lesions (mutations) typically found in CMML and/or the presence of CMML-related flow cytometry abnormalities may be employed as co-criteria and may lead to the diagnosis of CMML, provided that the pre-requisite criteria listed above are fulfilled. Pre-requisite criteria and co-criteria of the classical form of CMML are presented in Table 1.

### Monocytosis and a low lymphocyte to monocyte ratio are effective biomarkers of ulcerative colitis disease activity [^114DGqyU]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current biomarkers in ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited by their performance, cost, and limited availability in daily practice. This study examined alterations in the leukocyte profiles as biomarkers of UC activity, including the effects of age, gender, and medications.

Methods

Case-control study that included 110 UC subjects, 75 subjects with Clostridium difficile infection, and 75 non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects, randomly selected from a single-institution IBD database. Mean values of neutrophils (N), lymphocytes (L), monocytes (M) and their ratios were compared between groups. Receiver operator curve analyses assessed the performance of each biomarker in discriminating disease states. Subgroup analyses examined leukocytes profiles with endoscopic activity.

Results

Elevated monocyte counts and decreased L/M values significantly differed between subjects with active UC and UC in remission and performed better than the other leukocyte profiles. A monocyte count of 483 and L/M ratio of 3.1 were 60% sensitive and had a specificity of 61% and 53%, respectively for active UC. Monocyte count > 860 and L/M value < 1.6 had a 75% positive predictive value for UC activity. Those markers also correlated with endoscopically active disease. L/M and N/L values performed best at differentiating active UC from non-IBD controls, whereas N/L and N values performed best at differentiating from C. difficile controls.

Conclusions

Monocytosis and a low L/M ratio might be effective, readily available, and low-cost biomarkers to identify disease activity in UC patients. N/L values were more effective in distinguishing active UC patients from patients without IBD and those with C. difficile infection.

### Adipose tissue macrophages promote myelopoiesis and monocytosis in obesity [^112kbpzu]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue (AT), contributing to insulin resistance and diabetes. However, relatively little is known regarding the origin of AT macrophages (ATMs). We discovered that murine models of obesity have prominent monocytosis and neutrophilia, associated with proliferation and expansion of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors. AT transplantation conferred myeloid progenitor proliferation in lean recipients, while weight loss in both mice and humans (via gastric bypass) was associated with a reversal of monocytosis and neutrophilia. Adipose S100A8/A9 induced ATM TLR4/MyD88 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production. IL-1β interacted with the IL-1 receptor on BM myeloid progenitors to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils. These studies uncover a positive feedback loop between ATMs and BM myeloid progenitors and suggest that inhibition of TLR4 ligands or the NLRP3-IL-1β signaling axis could reduce AT inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity.

Hematological malignancies developing in community-based individuals with monocytosis

To investigate the incidence of hematological malignancies for individuals with monocytosis, a linkage of the Lifelines cohort to the NCR was performed. Incident malignancies could be evaluated for n = 21 601 older Lifelines participants, of whom 166 with monocytosis after a median follow-up of 7.7 (range, 6.1–11.4) years. Monocytosis associated with a higher risk of developing a hematological malignancy (P = 0.002, Gray's test; sHR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.29–6.55; p = 0.01) (Figure 5A). A total of 6 out of 166 developed a hematological malignancy during follow-up, and all were carrying CH. Four out of 6 developed a myeloid malignancy, and only 1 individual developed CMML. Out of 500 evaluable control subjects, n = 7 developed a hematological malignancy, of whom 5 were carrying CH.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^116AmTew]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Various forms of myeloid neoplasia can display persistent monocytosis, which may phenotypically overlap histopathology, and are differentiated by molecular diagnostics and, in this case, yield a diagnosis of CMML.NGS has been particularly transformational in diagnosis, risk stratification, and etiologic understanding of hematologic malignancy. Prognostic scoring systems use clinically obtained variables such as NGS mutations, blast percentage, blood cell counts, and transfusion dependency to predict risk of progression of disease to AML and overall survival to help guide clinical interventions. Importantly, as our understanding of mutations evolves, clinically obtained NGS panels are often not comprehensive. Thus, it is essential to review what was tested when considering "negative" test results. For example, no panel genetic testing before 2021 included UBA1 testing. Although not obtained in this case, flow cytometry of peripheral blood from patients with CMML also often demonstrates an immunophenotypic skew toward CD14 ++ CD16 + classical monocytes reaching a threshold of ≥ 94%, highly suggestive against reactive monocytosis.

Curative treatment for CMML requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which carries its own significant risks of morbidity and mortality. This patient has intermediate‐risk CMML by multiple scoring systems. Therapy for lower‐risk disease generally includes supportive measures such as transfusions and medications that improve cytopenias, whereas individuals with high symptom burden are increasingly managed with off‐label Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), especially ruxolitinib (RUX). For higher‐risk and/or progressive disease, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and HSCT can also be used (Supplemental Table 2). Notably, the clinical presence of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases is not included in risk stratification, and whether autoimmune features of MDS or CMML impacts prognosis is controversial. Because manifestations are variable, these do not have a standardized treatment approach and are often treated according to type and severity of disease in collaboration with rheumatology.

### Multicenter validation of the flow measurement of classical monocyte fraction for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia diagnosis [^113fLvGx]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) diagnosis requires both the presence of persistent peripheral monocytosis (≥ 1 × 10 9 /L) and monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the total white blood cell count. Such a monocytosis can also be seen in various diseases, including chronic or acute infections, chronic inflammatory processes, and hematopoietic malignancies, more specifically myeloproliferative neoplasms. CMML is characterized by a clonal hematopoiesis with abnormal myeloid differentiation, which is either dysplastic, leading to cytopenias, or exacerbated, leading to myeloproliferation, or both. Dysplasia of one or more myeloid lineages might be observed, yet is not mandatory. If myelodysplasia is absent or minimal, an acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormality should be detected for diagnosis statement. Indeed, most CMMLs have somatic mutations, especially of TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1 genes, and genes of the Ras pathway, although none of them are specific to the disease. For all these reasons, diagnosis of CMML has hitherto remained difficult.

We found that accumulation of classical monocytes (cMo) CD14 ++ CD16 − analyzed by flow cytometry, at the expense of intermediate monocytes (iMo) CD14 ++ CD16 + and nonclassical (ncMo) CD14 − / low CD16 +, can be a powerful tool to diagnose CMML, regardless of mutational background, subtype, or dysplastic versus proliferative features. We showed that a relative accumulation of cMo ≥ 94% of total peripheral blood monocytes distinguishes CMML from any type of reactive monocytosis with high specificity (94.1%) and sensitivity (91.9%). This 94% threshold was subsequently validated in two other independent studies, the latter highlighting the efficacy of this test to distinguish CMML from myeloproliferative neoplasms with associated monocytosis. Moreover, the sensitivity of cMo accumulation was recently demonstrated to increase with the subtype, reaching 100% for CMML type 2.

The flow cytometry-based monocyte subset analysis, hereafter referred to as "monocyte assay", is now proposed as an additional diagnostic modality in CMML. Since this assay has been largely adopted by diagnosis laboratories in France, we sought to assess its use throughout a nationwide survey and its performance through a multicenter evaluation.

Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms

This category of myeloid neoplasms is defined by overlapping pathologic and molecular features of MDS and MPN, often manifesting clinically with various combinations of cytopenias and cytoses. The definition of cytopenias is the same as that for MDS. The classification includes major revisions in the diagnostic criteria of CMML and terminology changes for other MDS/MPN types. (Table 5)

Table 5
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia diagnostic criteria, subtypes, and blast-based subgrouping criteria reflect diagnostic refinement and emphasize unifying characteristics

The prototype and most common MDS/MPN is chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), which is characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis and various combinations of somatic mutations involving epigenetic regulation, spliceosome, and signal transduction genes. Diagnostic criteria are revised to include prerequisite and supporting criteria. (Table 6) The first prerequisite criterion is persistent absolute (≥ 0.5 × 10 9 / L) and relative (≥ 10%) peripheral blood monocytosis. Namely, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis is lowered from 1.0 ×10 9 /L to 0.5 ×10 9 /L to incorporate cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic CMML. To enhance diagnostic accuracy when absolute monocytosis is ≥ 0.5 ×10 9 /L but < 1.0 ×10 9 /L, detection of one of more clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality and documentation of dysplasia in at least one lineage are required. Abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets is introduced as a new supporting criterion. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to classifying individuals with unexplained clonal monocytosis who do not fit the new diagnostic criteria of CMML.

In these instances, a documented history of MPN excludes CMML. The presence of MPN features in the bone marrow and/or high burden of MPN-associated mutations (JAK2, CALR or MPL) tends to support MPN with monocytosis rather than CMML.

c Criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions should be specifically excluded in cases with eosinophilia.

d Morphologic dysplasia should be present in ≥ 10% of cells of a haematopoietic lineage in the bone marrow.

Monocytosis in older individuals from the general population associates with a higher prevalence of CH

Guided by the fact that both CMML and CH predominantly occur in older individuals, we studied the prevalence and spectrum of CH in all individuals ≥ 60 years with monocytosis at the study inclusion visit. The flowchart for the nested case-control study is shown in Figure 2. Cases and control subjects were fully matched for age and sex (Table 1). We obtained data on CH by error-corrected next-generation sequencing of 27 genes for all 167 monocytosis cases and 501 matched control subjects. The mean sequencing depth was 9126 consensus reads, and the consensus read depth was > 500× for 97.7% of all regions (supplemental Figure 1). This revealed 379 mutations in leukemia-associated genes. In agreement with previous population-based cohorts, mutations were most frequently detected in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 genes. The majority of detected gene mutations were present at low VAF ≤ 10% (supplemental Figure 2). As a primary outcome for the nested case-control analyses, a higher prevalence of CH was found in the cohort with monocytosis (50.9%) as compared with control subjects (35.5%) (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–2.72; P < .001) (Figure 3A and supplemental Table 2). We additionally corrected the association between monocytosis and CH for baseline differences in hemoglobin, platelet, and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts using a multivariable logistic regression model, resulting in a comparable risk estimate (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.33–3.03; P < .001). In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses restricting to variants ≥ 2% VAF compatible with the definition of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, which confirmed a higher prevalence of CH in monocytosis cases (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.23–2.72; p = 0.002) (supplemental Figures 4–6). The prevalence of CH increased with age for both cases with monocytosis and control subjects (Figure 3B). For individuals with CH, no significant differences were observed in the number of mutated genes (P = 0.12) (Figure 3C). Absolute monocyte counts were higher in the presence of CH for individuals with monocytosis (P = 0.023) but not for control subjects (P = 0.398) (Figure 3E-F and supplemental Table 3).

Diagnosis update of OM cases previously not classified as CMML

Considering that the most impactful revision in both classifications was lowering the PB monocytosis threshold from ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L to ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L for the diagnosis of CMML, we additionally analyzed 2130 well-described OM cases (PB monocytes, 0.5 × 10 9 /L-1.0 × 10 9 /L) diagnosed during the same time interval defined earlier. Applying WHO22 and ICC22 criteria to diagnose OM-CMML led to 1.5 times more cases being classified as CMML based on the WHO22 than with the ICC22 criteria (356 vs 241 cases; Figure 1 C; supplemental Figure 3 B; supplemental Table 1). This difference originated mainly from differing BM requirements: the ICC22 requires myeloid proliferation and age-adjusted hypercellularity, whereas the WHO22 requires dysplasia in ≥ 1 myeloid lineage.

A closer inspection of reclassified OM cases revealed the majority of those being previously classified as MDS (WHO22, 89.6%; ICC22, 88.8%; supplemental Figure 4 A-C), in accordance with previous reports showing high transformation rates of OM-MDS cases into genuine CMML. Importantly, when assessing the equivalent ICC22 diagnosis of OM cases exclusively classified as CMML in the WHO22 classification, they fell into either the MDS or clonal monocytosis of undetermined significance (CMUS)/clonal cytopenia and monocytosis of undetermined significance (CCMUS) categories (supplemental Figure 4 D-E).

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115QFcSd]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Monocytosis and spliceosome mutations associate with inferior OS

Finally, we investigated whether CH affects the prognosis of older individuals with monocytosis. The presence of monocytosis was significantly associated with poor survival compared with those without monocytosis (age- and sex-corrected HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.65–3.21; P < .001). The presence of CH was not associated with a higher risk of death for these individuals with monocytosis (age- and sex-corrected HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.512–2.12; p = 0.92) nor for control subjects (age- and sex-corrected HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.80–2.26; p = 0.26) (Figure 5B). Although these results should be interpreted cautiously due to low numbers, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of mutational spectra in community-based subjects with monocytosis. The number of mutated genes did not affect OS (Figure 5C). However, the presence of spliceosome mutations is associated with a higher risk of death in older individuals with monocytosis (P < .001) (Figure 5D).

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^1166VEcB]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Apart from somatic mutations, other factors, such as epigenetic modifications, chronic inflammation or aging-related processes, may also trigger the selection and expansion of pre-malignant neoplastic clones in myeloid neoplasms including CMML. - Some of these conditions may present with persistent monocytosis without signs of an overt myeloid neoplasm and may represent pre-phases of overt CMML. In other patients, however, no or another hematopoietic neoplasm develops during follow-up. Therefore, our faculty concluded that this pre-phase should be termed idiopathic monocytosis of unknown significance, provided that the following criteria are met: (i) persistent (at least 3 months) relative (≥ 10%) and absolute (> 0.5x10 9 /L) monocytosis; (ii) no diagnostic dysplasia and no signs of myeloproliferation; (iii) no signs and criteria of a myeloid or other hematopoietic neoplasm fulfilled; (iv) no flow cytometric abnormalities or somatic mutations related to a myeloid, mast cell or lymphoid neoplasm detected in leukocytes; and (v) no reactive condition that would explain reactive monocytosis is detected (Table 4 and Online Supplementary Table S3). If CHIP-like mutations are found in such patients, but no hematopoietic neoplasm can be diagnosed using the WHO criteria, the final diagnosis changes to clonal monocytosis of unknown significance (Online Supplementary Table S3). It is also worth noting that idiopathic cytopenias of unknown significance can precede CMML.- Especially in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia of unknown significance, a CMML may be detected upon deeper investigations or during follow-up. - Finally, as mentioned before, oligomonocytic CMML, although proposed as a special variant of CMML, must also be regarded as a potential pre-phase of classical CMML. In this regard it is important to note that these patients should have a regular follow-up with repeated investigations of all disease-related parameters. A summary of non-clonal and clonal conditions potentially preceding CMML is shown in Table 4. With regard to criteria delineating non-clonal pre-diagnostic conditions, like idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance from the clonal conditions described above (CHIP, CCUS, CHOP), we refer the reader to the pertinent literature.

Table 1.
Minimal diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. *

The exclusion of various reactive states producing monocytosis (and sometimes even dysplasia) was also discussed and regarded as being of great importance. However, these mimickers cannot a priori exclude the presence of a concomitant CMML, but may indeed occur in CMML patients in the context of certain infections. Furthermore, most of these mimickers do not produce persistent monocytosis. Proof of clonality by molecular and cytogenetic studies, and other disease-specific parameters, together with global and specific laboratory (e.g. microbial screen) tests should easily lead to the conclusion that the patient is suffering from reactive monocytosis but not from (or also from) CMML.

The a priori exclusion of AML as a criterion should apply to both the classical and the special variants of CMML, whereas the a priori exclusion of other indolent hematopoietic neoplasms should only apply to the classical variant of CMML and oligomonocytic CMML but not to other special CMML variants. This is because several previous and more recent studies have shown that CMML may be accompanied by (or may accompany) other myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms, such as systemic mastocytosis. In several of these patients, the CMML clone is dominant and the additional sub-clone is smaller in size and usually not relevant clinically, even if these smaller clones express certain driver mutations, such as KIT D816V or a rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB. Rarely, a Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia may develop as an additional small-sized (sub)clone in a patient with CMML. Our faculty is of the opinion that the presence of additional (chronic) myeloid, mast cell, or lymphoid neoplasms does not exclude a diagnosis of CMML, provided that diagnostic WHO criteria for CMML are fulfilled. Moreover, these concomitant neoplasms should not exclude a diagnosis of CMML even when the driver of the concomitant disease (e.g. KIT D816V) is detectable in CMML monocytes. Thus, whereas the occurrence of AML is always regarded as transformation of CMML, the occurrence of indolent myeloid, mast cell, or lymphoid neoplasms should be regarded as concomitant disorders. Co-existing myeloid neoplasms and CMML may be derived from the same original founder clone.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^1132XLun]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is classified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm by the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic tumors. It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (> 1×10⁹/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin < 10 gm/dL and platelets < 100×10⁹/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age > 65 years, WBC > 15×10⁹/L, anemia, platelets < 100×10⁹/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^1146Ddau]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Mutational spectrum associated with monocytosis in older individuals

We next compared the mutational spectrum between cases with monocytosis and control subjects. Overall, a significant overlap was observed in the mutational spectrum of individuals with monocytosis and control subjects representing background age-related CH (Figure 3D). We subsequently evaluated the association of monocytosis with individual gene mutations. A higher proportion of individuals with monocytosis carried DNMT3A variants (P = 0.03). No significant differences were observed with regard to TET2 (P = 0.18) and ASXL1 (P = 0.10). Monocytosis was associated with a higher proportion of spliceosome mutations (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) (7.2%) when compared with control subjects (2.4%) (P = 0.007) (Figure 4A). The clonal trajectory from age-related CH to myeloid neoplasms may occur in a stepwise manner. Isolated mutated DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 are most frequently detected upon aging. In fact, the prevalence of CH confined to isolated mutated DNMT3A (P = 0.42), TET2 (P = 0.86), or ASXL1 (P = 1.00) (DTA) was comparable between cases with monocytosis and control subjects (Figure 4B). In contrast, individuals with monocytosis more frequently carried multiple gene mutations (21 out of 167 vs 29 out of 501; p = 0.006) or isolated gene mutations other than DTA (P = 0.010). Higher VAFs, consistent with increased clonal outgrowth, were found for individuals with mutational spectra involving multiple mutated genes, but this was observed both in the monocytosis and control cohort (Figure 4C-D and supplemental Figure 3). The combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations, which may be specific for a myeloid neoplasm with myelodysplasia and monocytosis, was observed twice in this community-based cohort with monocytosis (n = 167) and in 3 of the control subjects (n = 501). Other mutations observed at moderate frequencies in CMML, including RUNX1, CBL, NRAS / KRAS, and SETBP1, were detected in a few (n = 4) population-based individuals with monocytosis.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^116MZTkX]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Oligomonocytic CMML

Over the past few years, more and more cases of cytopenic patients exhibiting relative monocytosis (≥ 10%) and moderately increased absolute blood monocytes not reaching the required threshold to diagnose classical CMML (1.0x10 9 /L) have been described. These cases have recently been referred to as oligomonocytic CMML. According to the WHO classification most of these patients would be classified as having MDS (with monocytosis) or perhaps MPN/MDS-unclassifiable. However, most of these patients exhibit typical features of CMML, including a typical morphology of PB and BM cells, splenomegaly, and CMML-related molecular features (e.g. mutations in TET2 and SRSF2). - Some of these patients have prominent BM monocytosis without diagnostic PB monocytosis at diagnosis.

Whereas several of these cases remain stable without progression, the majority will develop 'overt' CMML or, eventually, secondary AML during follow-up. Therefore, oligomonocytic CMML may also be regarded as a potential pre-phase of classical CMML. Our faculty is of the opinion that the term oligomonocytic CMML should be used in clinical practice. Diagnostic pre-requisite criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are: (i) persistent (lasting at least 3 months) absolute peripheral monocytosis of 0.5–0.9×10 9 /L and relative blood monocytosis (≥ 10% of blood leukocytes); (ii) exclusion of BCR-ABL1 + leukemia, classical MPN and all other myeloid neoplasms that can explain monocytosis; and (iii) a blast cell count of 0–19% in PB and/or BM smears and exclusion of all histopathological, morphological, phenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic signs that count as proof of AML. Diagnostic dysplasia in one or more of the three major BM lineages (≥ 10%) must also be documented. If dysplasia is lacking or 'sub-diagnostic' (< 10%), the presence of cytogenetic or molecular lesions (mutations) typically found in CMML and/or the presence of CMML-related flow cytometry abnormalities, may also lead to the conclusion that the patient has oligomonocytic CMML provided that the other diagnostic criteria described above are fulfilled and all other myeloid neoplasms have been excluded. The proposed criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are listed in Table 3. Patients with oligomonocytic CMML should be managed and followed clinically in the same way as patients with classical CMML.

Table 6.
Commonly mutated genes detectable in patients with classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Our faculty recommends that next-generation sequencing studies should be regarded as a standard approach in all patients with suspected or known CMML as well as in patients with idiopathic monocytosis of unknown significance and in those with persistent reactive monocytosis (in order to exclude an additional clonal component). When a CMML-related mutation is found in an individual with idiopathic monocytosis of unknown significance or reactive monocytosis, the diagnosis may change to clonal monocytosis of unknown significance or oligomonocytic CMML, depending on additional findings.

Our faculty also recommends that the next-generation sequencing assay should have sufficient sensitivity (to detect 2–5% clonal cells) and should cover all relevant lesions shown in Table 6. In the context of CHIP/ARCH, a cutoff variant allele frequency of 2% is considered diagnostic, whereas in the context of CMML, we propose 10% as the variant allele frequency diagnostic cut off and thus marker to count as a co-criterion of CMML when, for example, no diagnostic morphological dysplasia can be documented (Tables 1 and 3), similar to the definition in MDS. Determining the variant allele frequency is also useful for documenting the clinical impact of certain driver lesions in special CMML variants (e.g. with JAK2 V617F or KIT D816V) and clone expansion during follow-up. Therefore, our faculty recommends that molecular studies in CMML should report variant allele frequencies with sufficient precision and sufficient sensitivity – in the same way as in MDS. Finally, our faculty recommends that molecular markers should increasingly be used to optimize prognostic scoring systems in CMML. -

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification and management [^114c4L26]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by prominent monocytosis and an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15%-20% over 3–5years).

Diagnosis

Newly revised diagnostic criteria include sustained (> 3months) peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (≥ 0.5×10 9 /L; monocytes ≥ 10% of leukocyte count), consistent bone marrow (BM) morphology, < 20% BM or PB blasts (including promonocytes), and cytogenetic or molecular evidence of clonality. Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while > 95% harbor somatic mutations: TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), RAS pathway (~30%), and others. The presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival (ASXL1 WT /TET2 MT genotype being favorable).

Risk Stratification

Several risk models serve similar purposes in identifying high-risk patients that are considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) earlier than later. Risk factors in the Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10×10 9 /L, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, platelet count < 100×10 9 /L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells; the resulting 4-tiered risk categorization includes high (≥ 3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors); the corresponding median survivals were 16, 31, 59, and 97months. CMML is also classified as being "myeloproliferative (MP-CMML)" or "myelodysplastic (MD-CMML)", based on the presence or absence of leukocyte count of ≥ 13×10 9 /L.

Treatment

ASCT is the only treatment modality that secures cure or long-term survival and is appropriate for MMM high/intermediate-2 risk disease. Drug therapy is currently not disease-modifying and includes hydroxyurea and hypomethylating agents; a recent phase-3 study (DACOTA) comparing hydroxyurea and decitabine, in high-risk MP-CMML, showed similar overall survival at 23.1 versus 18.4months, respectively, despite response rates being higher for decitabine (56% vs. 31%).

Unique Disease Associations

These include systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, leukemia cutis and lysozyme-induced nephropathy; the latter requires close monitoring of renal function during leukocytosis and is a potential indication for cytoreductive therapy.

### Flow cytometry based monocyte subset analysis accurately distinguishes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from myeloproliferative neoplasms with associated monocytosis [^113YLuYV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndrome characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis (absolute monocyte count/AMC ⩾1 × 10(9)/l, ⩾10% of the total white blood cell count) and an inherent risk for leukemic transformation. Monocytosis, however, is not pathognomic for CMML and can be associated with reactive and clonal processes, including MPN such as polycythemia Vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). On the basis of the flow cytometric expression of CD14/CD16, monocytes can be classified into; classical MO1 (CD14 + /CD16 –), intermediate MO2 (CD14 + /CD16 +) and non-classical MO3 (CD14 − /CD16 +) fractions, with MO1 constituting the major monocyte population (85%) in healthy conditions. A recent publication using multiparametric flow cytometry demonstrated a characteristic increase in classical monocytes (cut off value 94%) in CMML patients, distinguishing them from other causes of reactive and clonal monocytosis. The associated sensitivity and specificity values were 95.1% and 90.6%, respectively. This pattern was independent of mutational background and CMML patients that responded to hypomethylating agents had normalization of the MO1 fraction, thus potentially acting as a biomarker predicting response. These findings were validated by a second study, where MO1 monocytes were also found to define a favorable subset of MDS patients, characterized by a higher prevalence of SF3B1 mutations. Given the inherent difficulty in distinguishing CMML cases from MPN cases with absolute monocytosis, we carried out this study using a similar multiparametric flow cytometry approach.

### Prognostic significance of peripheral monocytosis after reperfused acute myocardial infarction: a possible role for left ventricular remodeling [^117R7eQn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the significance of peripheral monocytosis in clinical outcome after reperfused acute myocardial infarction (AMI), especially relating to post-infarct left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Background

Peripheral monocytosis occurs two to three days after AMI, reflecting infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the necrotic myocardium. However, the prognostic significance of peripheral monocytosis after AMI remains to be determined.

Methods

A total of 149 patients with first Q-wave AMI were studied. White blood cell (WBC) count, percentage of monocytes and serum C-reactive protein level were measured every 24 h for four days after the onset of AMI. We assessed association between peripheral monocytosis and prognosis including pump failure, LV aneurysm and long-term outcome after AMI.

Results

Patients with pump failure (p < 0.0001) or LV aneurysm (p = 0.005) had higher peak monocyte counts than those without these complications. Predischarge left ventriculography revealed that peak monocyte count was positively correlated with LV end-diastolic volume (p = 0.024) and negatively correlated with ejection fraction (p = 0.023). Multivariate analyses showed that peak monocyte count ≥ 900/mm(3) was an independent determinant of pump failure (relative risk [RR] 9.83, p < 0.0001), LV aneurysm (RR 4.78, p = 0.046) and cardiac events (RR 6.30, p < 0.0001), including readmission for heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction and cardiac deaths, including sudden deaths.

Conclusions

Peripheral monocytosis is associated with LV dysfunction and LV aneurysm, suggesting a possible role of monocytes in the development of LV remodeling after reperfused AMI.

3 Monocytic and Myelomonocytic Leukemias

Mature and immature monocytes are usually part of the malignant clone in diverse myeloid neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myeloid leukemias. Chronic leukemias typically presenting with monocytosis include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) where only absolute monocytosis is found, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), where relative and absolute monocytosis are usually present (Table 3). Clonal monocytes in CMML and other chronic myeloid neoplasms are CD14+ cells. In myelomonocytic and monocytic AML, clonal monocytic cells may also be detected. A morphologic classification of monocytic cells and their progenitors detectable in myeloid leukemias, together with morphologic criteria, is shown in Table S5.

Patients with JMML usually present with splenomegaly, leukocytosis and monocytosis, and a hypercellular BM. Blast cells may be increased but are less than 20%. CMML is usually diagnosed in adults and defined by relative and absolute monocytosis. In most cases, leukocytosis and splenomegaly are detected. Depending on the blast count, CMML is split into CMML‐1 (BM blasts < 10% and PB blasts < 5%) and CMML‐2 (BM blasts 10%–19%, circulating blasts 5%–19%). In both JMML and CMML, the presence of AML and CML must be excluded by definition. However, both types of neoplasms can transform into overt (secondary) AML.

Based on the 2022‐updated WHO classification (5th Edition), many AML variants are defined by molecular and cytogenetic aberrations. However, two types of AML are defined by monocytic differentiation, namely acute myelomonocytic leukemia (myelomonocytic AML) and acute monocytic leukemia (monocytic AML). For myelomonocytic AML, the following criteria apply: (i) at least 20% of all cells are monocytes or monocyte precursors, (ii) ≥ 20% of cells are maturing granulocytic cells, and (iii) ≥ 3% of the blasts are positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO). Monocytic AML is defined by the following criteria: (i) ≥ 80% of cells are monocytes and/or monocyte precursors, (ii) < 20% of cells are maturing granulocytes, and iii) blasts and promonocytes (monocytic cells) must express at least two of the following markers: CD11c, CD14, CD36, or CD64 or show non‐specific esterase (NSE) positivity.

### The use of targeted sequencing and flow cytometry to identify patients with a clinically significant monocytosis [^117ALYsw]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) remains centered on morphology, meaning that the distinction from a reactive monocytosis is challenging. Mutational analysis and immunophenotyping have been proposed as potential tools for diagnosis; however, they have not been formally assessed in combination. We aimed to investigate the clinical utility of these technologies by performing targeted sequencing, in parallel with current gold standard techniques, on consecutive samples referred for investigation of monocytosis over a 2-year period (N = 283). Results were correlated with the morphological diagnosis and objective outcome measures, including overall survival (OS) and longitudinal blood counts. Somatic mutations were detected in 79% of patients, being invariably identified in those with a confirmed diagnosis (99%) but also in 57% of patients with nondiagnostic bone marrow features. The OS in nondiagnostic mutated patients was indistinguishable from those with CMML (P = 0.118) and significantly worse than in unmutated patients (P = 0.0002). On multivariate analysis, age, ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, NRAS, and RUNX1 mutations retained significance. Furthermore, the presence of a mutation was associated with a progressive decrease in hemoglobin/platelet levels and increasing monocyte counts compared with mutation-negative patients. Of note, the immunophenotypic features of nondiagnostic mutated patients were comparable to CMML patients, and the presence of aberrant CD56 was highly specific for detecting a mutation. Overall, somatic mutations are detected at high frequency in patients referred with a monocytosis, irrespective of diagnosis. In those without a World Health Organization-defined diagnosis, the mutation spectrum, immunophenotypic features, and OS are indistinguishable from CMML patients, and these patients should be managed as such.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia diagnosis and management [^112avKrb]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare, heterogeneous myeloid malignancy classified as a myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndrome by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its initial presentation can be incidental or associated with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative symptoms and up to 20% of patients harbor a concurrent inflammatory or autoimmune condition. Persistent monocytosis is the hallmark of CMML but diagnosis can be challenging. Increased understanding of human monocyte subsets, chromosomal abnormalities, and somatic gene mutations have led to more accurate diagnosis and improved prognostication. A number of risk stratification systems have been developed and validated but using those that incorporate molecular information such as CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS)-Mol, Mayo Molecular, and Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) are preferred. Symptom-directed approaches forms the basis of CMML management. Outcomes vary substantially depending on risk ranging from observation for a number of years to rapidly progressive disease and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. Patients who are low risk but with symptoms from cytopenias or proliferative features such as splenomegaly may be treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or cytoreductive therapy, respectively, with the goal of durable symptoms control. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should be considered for intermediate to high risk patients. The lack of effective pharmaceutical options has generated interest in novel therapeutics for this disease, and early phase clinical trial results are promising.

Role of flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing and bone marrow biopsies in the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

Conventional flow cytometry has a limited diagnostic role in CMML, given that immature/neoplastic monocytes do not express unique surface markers and that promonocytes/monoblasts are frequently CD34-negative (blast marker). Flow abnormalities that can be detected in CMML include abnormal myeloid maturation patterns involving CD11b, CD13 and CD16, along with aberrant expression of CD56 on monocytes. Monocyte repartitioning by flow cytometry has gained popularity, especially given its ability to differentiate CMML from other reactive and clonal causes of monocytosis. Based on the expression of CD14 and CD16, monocytes can be divided into three categories: CD14 + /CD16 - classical (M01), CD14 low /CD16 + intermediate (M02), and CD14 - /CD16 + non-classical monocytes (M03) (Figure 2). These subsets differ in their chemokine receptor expression, phagocytic activity, epigenetic profiles and have unique metabolic pathway dependencies. In CMML, a pivotal study demonstrated an increase in the M01 subset, with an established cutoff > 94% being associated with sensitivity and specificity values of 90.6% and 95.1%, respectively. These findings have been validated independently and this method importantly is effective in identifying MDS patients whose disease eventually evolves into CMML and in distinguishing CMML from MPN with monocytosis. False negative findings secondary to autoimmunity/inflammation (expansion of the M02 fraction) and false positive findings in myeloid neoplasms such as MDS, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and classical chronic myeloid leukemia have been documented. I do use this flow cytometry assay for screening patients who present with sustained monocytosis, especially when there is suspicion of an underlying clonal process and to differentiate CMML-associated monocytosis from other myeloid neoplasms with monocytosis.

Results

We evaluated data from 10 822 patients who were newly diagnosed with MM at VA medical centers between 2000 and 2019, and their demographic and clinical characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 69.7 years (IQR 62.9–77.0 years), with 97.6% of patients being male. AMC did not vary significantly based on race. Abnormal AMC (including low, elevated, and severely elevated) was present in 25.3% of patients at diagnosis (2737 out of 10 822 patients); with 5% having low, 16.7% having elevated, and 3.6% having severely elevated AMC. Patients with monocytosis (elevated or severely elevated AMC) had higher median LDH (179 [IQR, 139–246] and 216 [IQR 161–345], respectively). Among evaluable patients, ISS stage 2 and 3 was present in 73.3% of the overall cohort and in 82.5%, 72.1%, 75.2%, and 77.5% of patients with low, normal, elevated, and severely elevated AMC, respectively.

Table 1.
Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with MM at diagnosis included in the study (n = 10 822)

Inferior OS with abnormal AMC at diagnosis

Median OS of the entire population was 3.36 years (95% confidence interval, 3.26–3.47). The OS of patients with abnormal AMC at diagnosis was significantly inferior than that of patients with normal AMC. Median OS of patients with low, severely elevated, elevated, and normal AMC at diagnosis was 2.3, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.6 years (P < .001), respectively (Figure 1).

### Characteristic repartition of monocyte subsets as a diagnostic signature of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^116cpqBx]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/ myeloproliferative neoplasm whose diagnosis is currently based on the elevation of peripheral blood monocytes to > 1 × 10(9)/L, measured for ≥ 3 months. Diagnosis can be ambiguous; for example, with prefibrotic myelofibrosis or reactive monocytosis. We set up a multiparameter flow cytometry assay to distinguish CD14(+)/CD16(-) classical from CD14(+)/CD16(+) intermediate and CD14(low)/CD16(+) nonclassical monocyte subsets in peripheral blood mononucleated cells and in total blood samples. Compared with healthy donors and patients with reactive monocytosis or another hematologic malignancy, CMML patients demonstrate a characteristic increase in the fraction of CD14(+)/CD16(-) cells (cutoff value, 94.0%). The associated specificity and sensitivity values were 95.1% and 90.6% in the learning cohort (175 samples) and 94.1% and 91.9% in the validation cohort (307 samples), respectively. The accumulation of classical monocytes, which demonstrate a distinct gene expression pattern, is independent of the mutational background. Importantly, this increase disappears in patients who respond to hypomethylating agents. We conclude that an increase in the fraction of classical monocytes to > 94.0% of total monocytes is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker that rapidly and accurately distinguishes CMML from confounding diagnoses.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^115WGPTw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Collectively, we consider VEXAS in patients with robust adult‐onset multisystem inflammation with or without vasculitis, especially, though not universally, if cytopenia or macrocytosis is present and the patient is male, with a broader differential diagnosis including myeloid neoplasia with inflammatory features. LVV appears to be an uncommon phenotype. Testing should ideally include whole‐gene UBA1 sequencing, not limited amplicon testing at M41, and is commercially available from companies such as the Genomic Testing Cooperative and Blueprint Genetics. This can currently be performed by rheumatology or hematology/oncology, but in the future, it is most likely to be incorporated into hematologic clinical NGS mutation panels for hematologic malignancy.

Hematology approach to diagnosis and management of suspected

Hematology consultation should be pursued in patients with vasculitis and cytopenia if counts are severe or trending down despite treatment (Figure 2) or associated with symptoms such as difficult‐to‐treat or chronic infections, presence of bleeding or bruising, worsening fatigue, and/or B symptoms. Persistent overproduction of cells such as lymphocytosis, erythrocytosis, or, as in this case, monocytosis should also lead to hematology consultation, especially when cytopenia coexists. Hematologists will consider a wide differential diagnosis that includes various hematologic malignancies and a multitude of alternative and potentially reversible diagnoses (Figure 2). For example, monocytosis is most commonly reactive to acute or chronic infection. If no reversible cause is identified or if cytopenia or cytoses persists despite their treatment, further tests are needed, including bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and various context‐dependent functional and molecular clonal analyses that may include flow cytometry, NGS, cytogenetics, T cell receptor clonality, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In our practices, these tests are typically ordered and interpreted by the hematologist or oncologist, given their expertise.

Abnormal AMC after diagnosis is associated with poor OS

We next evaluated AMC at follow-up time points after induction therapy. Abnormal AMC (low, elevated, and severely elevated) at multiple subsequent time points indicated poor OS (Figure 2; supplemental Figure 1). We focused on later time points when the direct impact of induction regimen might have been less. As seen in Figure 2 A-B, abnormal AMC at 1 and 2.5 years after MM diagnosis was associated with significantly lower OS at both the time points. Median OS at 1 year was 2.6, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.7 years (P = 0.046), whereas the median OS at 2.5 years was 2.0, 2.6, 3.4, and 3.9 years (P < .001) in patients with low, severely elevated, elevated, and normal AMC, respectively.

Figure 2.

Developing an abnormal AMC during follow-up is associated with poor OS

We further investigated whether a change in AMC category at follow-up from AMC at diagnosis was predictive of outcome. Patients with normal AMC at diagnosis who developed abnormal AMC > 1 year after MM diagnosis experienced inferior outcomes compared with patients who maintained a normal AMC (Figure 3 A-B). In contrast, patients with monocytosis at diagnosis (both elevated and severely elevated) had no significant change in survival irrespective of whether the abnormal AMC persisted or normalized (supplemental Figure 3 C-E). We did not have an adequate number of patients with low AMC at diagnosis to study the impact of change in AMC at follow-up.

### Monocytosis in polycythemia vera: clinical and molecular correlates [^111vJFtx]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Monocytosis (absolute monocyte count, AMC ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L) might accompany a spectrum of myeloid neoplasms, other than chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In the current study, we examined the prevalence, laboratory and molecular correlates, and prognostic relevance of monocytosis in polycythemia vera (PV). Among 267 consecutive patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined PV, 55 (21%) patients displayed an AMC of ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L and 18 (7%) an AMC of ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L. In general, PV patients with monocytosis were significantly older and displayed higher frequencies of leukocytosis (81% vs. 50% at AMC ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L) and TET2/SRSF2 mutations (57%/29% vs. 19%/1% at AMC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L). In univariate analysis, AMC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L adversely affected overall (OS; p = 0.004; HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4–4.8) and myelofibrosis-free (MFFS; p = 0.02; HR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3–15.1) survival; during multivariable analysis, significance was borderline sustained for OS (P = 0.05) and MFFS (P = 0.06). Other independent risk factors for OS included unfavorable karyotype (P = 0.02, HR 3.39, 95% CI 1.17–9.79), older age (P < .0001, HR 3.34 95% CI 1.97–5.65), and leukocytosis ≥ 15 × 10 9 /L (P = 0.004, HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.26–3.29). In conclusion, in the current study, we encountered a higher than expected prevalence of monocytosis in patients with PV and the mutation profile and age distribution of PV patients with monocytosis is akin to those of patients with CMML and might partly contribute to their worse prognosis.

### Monocytic leukemia cutis diagnosed simultaneously with refractory anemia with monocytosis: a case report [^111tMovA]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

A case of leukemia cutis (LC) of monocytic lineage in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is presented. Cutaneous infiltrates were recognized concurrent with diagnosis of refractory anemia (RA) with monocytosis. Skin infiltrates subsequently spontaneously regressed although MDS progressed with increasing monocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Death occurred 6 months after diagnosis with evolution of acute monoblastic leukemia complicated by sepsis. This case supports previous observations of poor prognosis associated with leukemia cutis. LC associated with MDS is reviewed including the role of monocytes.

RNA-seq was used to identify the partner gene and confirm the presence of a BCR-PDGFRB fusion. Identification of this fusion product resulted in successful treatment and long-term remission of this myeloid neoplasm. Based on our results, we suggest that despite current WHO recommendations, screening for PDGFRB rearrangement in cases of leukocytosis with eosinophilia and no other etiologic explanation is necessary, even if the karyotype is normal.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^111tTK3G]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia:

CMML is a neoplasm associated with aging, often arising in the background of clonal hematopoiesis (bi-allelic TET2, or TET2/SRSF2 mutations), with the subsequent acquisition of mutations involving signaling (RAS pathway or JAK2 V617F), epigenetic regulation (SETBP1, DNMT3A and EZH2), transcription factors (RUNX1) and pre mRNA splicing (SF3B1 and U2AF1), shaping clinical phenotypes (Figure 1). There are pCMML subtypes in which oncogenic RAS pathway mutations (NRAS, CBL, KRAS and PTPN11) are clear initiating driver mutations, occurring early in the course of disease, associated with poor outcomes (decreased survival and higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) (Figure 1). Unlike in MDS, MPN or AML, TP53 mutations are extremely infrequent in CMML (< 1%), and are only really encountered at the time of CMML to AML transformation, or in the context of therapy-related CMML.

The 2016 iteration of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms has outlined diagnostic criteria for CMML which include the presence of sustained peripheral blood monocytosis, absence of reactive causes, the presence of < 20% blasts and promonocytes (blast equivalents) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and exclusion of molecularly defined myeloid neoplasms that can present with monocytosis (BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 and PCM1-JAK2 rearrangements), with or without dysplasia (Table 1). In the absence of dysplasia, a diagnosis of CMML can be made if the monocytosis has persisted for ≥ 3 months, reactive causes have been excluded, or somatic cytogenetic or molecular markers frequent in CMML (e.g. ASXL1, TET2, SRSF2 and SETBP1) can be documented. While this approach is very reasonable, there are limitations and important nuances associated with these criteria.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^113YxmPt]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diag nostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to distinguish between 'normal', pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.

### Utility of JAK2 V617F allelic burden in distinguishing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from primary myelofibrosis with monocytosis [^1177vwvU]. Human Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

The concurrent presence of JAK2 V617F, monocytosis, and bone marrow fibrosis can be observed in both chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). It can be challenging to distinguish CMML with JAK2 mutation and fibrosis from other myeloid neoplasms, particularly PMF. To identify key features that may help distinguish these 2 entities, we retrospectively studied 21 cases diagnosed as "CMML" with JAK2 V617F and bone marrow fibrosis that were identified from a cohort of 610 cases of CMML diagnosed in 2006 to 2016. Upon further review, we confirmed the diagnosis of CMML in 7 cases, 11 cases were reclassified as PMF, and 3 cases had features intermediate between CMML and PMF (gray zone). These 11 cases of PMF with monocytosis featured a higher JAK2 V617F allelic burden (median, 43%; range, 20%-62%) and atypical pleomorphic megakaryocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei. Complete blood count showed more pronounced myeloid left shift. In contrast, 7 CMML cases had significantly lower JAK2 V617F allelic burden (median, 17%; range, 5%-36%; P < .0001) and dysplastic megakaryocytes along with variable degree of dysplasia in other lineages. The median survival of PMF and CMML patients was 32 and 40 months, respectively. We conclude that besides morphology of megakaryocytes and other features, JAK2 V617F allelic burden can help differentiate CMML from PMF with monocytosis. SRSF2 and RAS mutations are observed in both disease categories. Rare gray-zone cases exist with hybrid features.

### Characteristics and long-term outcome in a large series of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia patients including 104 formerly referred to as oligomonocytic [^111hewSU]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently modified diagnostic criteria for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) have lowered the cut-off for absolute monocytosis. In the largest series to date, we have analysed 313 CMML patients, including 104 with oligomonocytic (OM)-CMML. Five-year survival was longer for OM-CMML than for other patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified OM-CMML as a favourable prognostic factor (HR 0.58; p = 0.002). The 5-year cumulative incidence of progression to classical CMML was 47%. Older age and transfusion dependence were adverse prognostic factors for OM-CMML. Our results support the inclusion of OM-CMML in the CMML category as a subtype with superior outcomes.

### Multicenter validation of the flow measurement of classical monocyte fraction for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia diagnosis [^1173kz2M]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral blood monocytes include three subsets defined by CD14 and CD16 surface markers. An increase in the CD14 ++ CD16 - classical monocyte fraction ≥ 94% of the total monocytes was proposed to rapidly and efficiently distinguish chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from reactive monocytosis. The robustness of this assay required a multicenter validation. The flow cytometry assay designed to quantify peripheral blood monocyte subsets was implemented by multiple diagnosis laboratories in France. A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate its performance. All the 48 French laboratories answered the questionnaire, revealing that 63% use this assay routinely. Central blind reanalysis of 329 cytometry files collected from five laboratories demonstrated an excellent correlation in classical monocyte fraction measurement (r = 0.93; p < 0.0001). The cutoff value of 94% classical monocytes being the critical readout for diagnosis, we then compared 115 patients with classical monocytes ≥ 94% and 214 patients with a fraction < 94% between initial analysis and reanalysis. An agreement was obtained in 311 files. Finally, an overt diagnosis, available for 86 files, confirmed a good sensitivity (93.6%) and specificity (89.7%). This survey demonstrates the robustness of the flow assay with limited variability of classical monocyte percentage between centers, validates the 94% cutoff value, and confirms its sensitivity and specificity.

Study variables and assessments

Baseline data obtained included the date of diagnosis, age, sex, race, serum LDH, β2m, serum albumin, and serum creatinine. Stage was calculated using baseline data (serum albumin and β2m) and classified according to the ISS, which is known to be associated with OS in newly diagnosed MM. The time to follow-up was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until development of another hematologic malignancy, death, truncation date (15 years after MM diagnosis), or the study end date, whichever came first.

Monocytosis was defined based on the institution's cut-off as an AMC increase greater than 0.8 × 10(800/mm 3). We obtained baseline and follow-up AMC in patients whose AMC was measured using an automated or manual differential. We used the AMC closest to and within 90 days of MM diagnosis and at 3-month intervals until 2.5 years after diagnosis. We chose a cut-off of 2.5 years based on the median OS of our cohort. AMC at the timepoint of interest was used to assign patients to AMC categories for the final analysis. Patients were stratified into 4 AMC categories: low (< 0.2), normal (0.2- < 0.8), elevated (0.8- < 1.25), and severely elevated (≥ 1.25). To avoid using treatment-related changes in AMC, we excluded any AMC obtained within 7 days of an abnormal neutrophil count. Survival analysis at each time interval included patients who had available laboratory data.

### Outcomes and molecular profile of oligomonocytic CMML support its consideration as the first stage in the CMML continuum [^114sCy5M]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients with OM-CMML are currently categorized in the various MDS categories of the 2017 WHO classification, but they display clinical, morphological, cytogenetic, molecular, and immunophenotypic profiles similar to those of patients with overt CMML. By definition, these patients present a relative monocytosis in the absence of absolute monocytosis and leukocytosis. The proliferative phenotype of CMML (ie, the presence of at least 13 × 10 9 /L leukocytes) has been associated with a mutational profile enriched in the RAS pathway, ASXL1, SETBP1, and JAK2 mutations. JAK2 mutations are observed in only ∼5% to 10% of patients with CMML, they are usually subclonal events, and the progressive increment in their VAFs are typically associated with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Different from the rest of the gene mutations associated with leukocytosis, JAK2 mutations have not been associated with worse outcomes in this disease. It may be very difficult to distinguish OM-CMML or CMML from myeloproliferative neoplasms with relative and/or absolute monocytosis (eg, essential thrombocythemia with monocytosis, prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis with monocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis with monocytosis). For these cases, the only way to establish an accurate diagnosis is to perform a BM biopsy with a detailed histologic examination. In this scenario, the analysis by FC of the distribution of peripheral blood monocyte subsets seems to be a very useful tool for discriminating between myeloproliferative neoplasms with monocytosis and CMML. Differential diagnosis with other situations such as systemic mastocytosis with an associated CMML requires further diagnostic workup (eg, KIT mutation analysis, FC assessment of expression of CD2 and CD25 on mast cells, blue toluidine staining of the BM) in addition to a histological examination of a BM biopsy specimen.

### Risk prediction for clonal cytopenia: multicenter real-world evidence [^115G829r]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the fifth edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumors, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was formally defined by the presence of a myeloid-associated somatic mutation in the blood or bone marrow, with a variant allele fraction (VAF) of ≥ 2% among individuals without a myeloid neoplasm (MN) diagnosis or unexplained cytopenia. If the patient has unexplained cytopenia(s), the condition is then diagnosed as clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS). In addition, if the patient has an absolute monocyte count (AMC) of ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L, monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of white blood cell (WBC) differential, and no morphologic findings of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in the bone marrow, CHIP and CCUS are further defined as clonal monocytosis of undetermined significance (CMUS) and clonal cytopenia and monocytosis of undetermined significance (CCMUS), respectively. These classifications are based on the International Consortium Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias.

### Mutational status affects myelodysplastic syndrome evolution to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^111ZgYx4]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the 4 th iteration of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification that came out in 2017, a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) still required a persistent absolute (≥ 1x10 9 /L) and relative (≥ 10% of white blood cell [WBC] count) monocytosis. Nevertheless, several reports suggested that up to 30% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) evolved into genuine CMML, raising for many years the question of a "preCMML" state. An oligo-monocytic CMML entity was subsequently described in patients displaying a relative monocytosis with an absolute monocyte count between 0.5x10 9 /L and 1x10 9 /L, providing a rationale to revise CMML diagnosis criteria in the recent 5 th edition of the WHO classification that considers a relative monocytosis ≥ 10% of WBC and an absolute monocyte count ≥ 0.5x10 9 /L. An increased fraction of circulating classical monocytes (cMO, defined by flow cytometry as CD14 ++ CD16 - fraction) ≥ 94%, which was shown to distinguish CMML from reactive monocytosis, was included as a supportive criterion for CMML diagnosis. Notwithstanding these new diagnosis criteria, MDS with bone marrow (BM) monocyte infiltration could represent another group of pre-CMML. The present longitudinal study aims at identifying robust predictors of MDS evolution to "overt" CMML.

Between 2018 and 2020, flow cytometry analysis of monocyte subset partition was performed in 44 patients with non-treated MDS and were included in a learning cohort together with 22 CMML patients (Table 1). In a control group of 19 patients with established, non-treated CMML according to the 2017 WHO classification, flow cytometry analysis of monocyte subsets mostly showed a relative accumulation of cMO ≥ 94% of total circulating monocytes. The same flow analysis in patients with an MDS diagnosis showed an increase in the fraction of cMO ≥ 94% in 18 of 44 (41%) patients, a proportion consistent with a previous report. These cases were defined as "CMML-like MDS", while MDS cases without an increase in the fraction of cMO ≥ 94% were designated as "other MDS" (n = 26) (Table 1; Figure 1A, B).

### Leukocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia in systemic mastocytosis: analysis of phenotype, genetics and prognosis in 596 patients from the GREM registry [^112MYSEz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukocytosis, monocytosis, and eosinophilia (L/M/E) are recurrent findings in systemic mastocytosis (SM).

Objective

To investigate the prevalence of L/M/E in SM and assess their association with clinical phenotype, mutational profile, and overall survival (OS) in advanced SM (AdvSM).

Methods

Within the German Registry on Disorders of Eosinophilia and Mast Cells (GREM), 596 SM patients (91% KIT D816V positive; 270 AdvSM, 326 non-AdvSM) were analyzed for L/M/E.

Results

In comparison to non-AdvSM, AdvSM patients had significantly higher leukocyte (median 9.4 vs. 6.9×10 9 /L), monocyte (median 0.7 vs. 0.5×10 9 /L), and eosinophil counts (median 0.3 vs. 0.1×10 9 /L; all P < 0.001) with highest counts (leukocytes: 10.2×10 9 /L, monocytes: 0.9×10 9 /L, eosinophils: 0.3×10 9 /L; all P < 0.001) being observed in SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN). High counts of L/M/E correlated with an increased number of additional somatic mutations (P = 0.012, P < 0.001, P = 0.020) with monocytosis being specially associated with mutations in ASXL1 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; 95% CI: 1.5–5.8), SRSF2 (OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2–4.0), and TET2 (OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2–4.0). In AdvSM, optimal OS cut-off values based on maximally selected rank statistics were ≥ 16.8×10 9 /L for leukocytosis (median OS: 1.6 vs. 4.7 years, P < 0.001), ≥ 1.1×10 9 /L for monocytosis (2.9 vs. 4.8 years, P < 0.001), and ≥ 1.5×10 9 /L for eosinophilia (1.7 vs. 5.0 years, P < 0.001). Monocytosis and/or eosinophilia defined a three-tiered risk model (median OS: 1.60 vs. 3.04 vs. 6.94 years, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Elevated counts of L/M/E are indicative of AdvSM and within AdvSM associated with additional somatic mutations, a subtype of SM-AHN and poor prognosis.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Cutaneous myeloid dendritic cell dyscrasia: a cutaneous clonal monocytosis associated with chronic myeloproliferative disorders and peripheral blood monocytosis [^114RGgtb]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Monocytes are critical components of the innate immune system and they can differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs). Cutaneous neoplasms of dendritic cell origin are uncommon and mostly represented by histiocytic lesions derived primarily from Langerhans cells. The myeloid DC (mDC) while recognized in the immunology literature does not have a well-defined neoplastic cutaneous counterpart. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous mDC dyscrasia were evaluated. Routine hematoxylin and eosin stain were performed followed by selective phenotypic studies. The patients were older without a gender predilection and exhibited an asymptomatic papular skin rash with a waxing and waning course. The biopsies demonstrated a dermal based monomorphic small mononuclear cell infiltrate. The cells expressed CD14, CD11c, HLA-DR, as well as granzyme and lysozyme that defines terminally differentiated monocyte/dendritic cells. Expression of BDCA-3 (CD141) by the tumor cells indicated that they were myeloid dendritic cells (mDC2). Each patient had a prior or subsequent diagnosis of an abnormal bone marrow biopsy that included myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. We propose the term cutaneous mDC cell dyscrasia for distinctive infiltrates of differentiated mDCs reflective of underlying myeloproliferative disease. The clinical course is variable and can be indolent although it is strongly correlated with myelodysplastic syndrome that included leukemia.

### How to differentiate congenital from noncongenital chronic neutropenia at the first medical examination? Proposal of score: a pilot study from the French severe chronic neutropenia registry [^111wezvK]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We developed a diagnostic score to differentiate congenital from noncongenital neutropenia at the time of diagnosis using reliable data collected at the first visit of a patients with neutropenia.

Study Design

In a pilot retrospective study, we included 120 patients diagnosed with chronic neutropenia; 61 had congenital and 59 had noncongenital neutropenia. We reviewed patient medical charts and collected the initial complete blood count (CBC) and other reliable data. We used logistic regression to determine the probability that the neutropenia was congenital.

Results

On the initial CBC, the degree of neutropenia had no predictive value; only monocytosis > 1.5 × 10 9 /l, hemoglobin < 90 g/l, or mild thrombocytopenia < 150 × 10 9 /l suggested congenital neutropenia. The most predictive factors for congenital neutropenia were a medical history (consanguinity and patient history of neutropenia), severe infections, and oral stomatitis or gingivitis at the time of diagnosis. The age at diagnosis had limited predictive value.

Conclusion

A diagnosis of congenital neutropenia may be reliably suspected based only on information from the CBC, some basic information from patient and parent interviews, and a clinical examination. A pilot score with six factors that could be readily, reliably collected, should facilitate the diagnosis of congenital neutropenia.

Multicenter validation of the 94% cMo threshold

Among the 245 files displaying more than 10,000 cMo events, we collected clinical data when available (demographic and hematological data, Table 1). We obtained 86 files associated to an overt diagnosis, namely 47 CMML according to the WHO 2017 criteria, 23 reactive monocytosis, and 16 non-CMML malignancies. Among the 47 CMML patients, 32 (68%) were newly-diagnosed CMML. The 15 patients who had a pre-existing diagnosis received supportive care (e.g. blood transfusion and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) or cytoreductive drugs, but none of them were treated with a hypomethylating agent.

### Longitudinal analysis of leukocyte differentials in peripheral blood of patients with acute respiratory viral infections [^112TywQS]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Leukocyte counts and differentials are commonly acquired in patients with suspected respiratory viral infections and may contribute diagnostic information. However, most published work is limited to a single timepoint at initial presentation to a medical provider, which may correspond to widely varying points in the course of disease.

Objectives

To examine the temporal development and time-dependent utility of routine leukocyte differentials in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections.

Study Design

We analyzed data from recent experimental human challenges with influenza A/H3N2, human rhinovirus (HRV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Routine clinical lab cell counts and differentials were measured daily from the time period immediately prior to inoculation through the eventual resolution of symptomatic disease.

Results

Approximately 50% of challenged individuals developed symptoms and viral shedding consistent with clinical disease. Subpopulations of WBC showed marked differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals over time, but these changes were much more profound and consistent in influenza infection. Influenza-infected subjects develop both relative lymphopenia and relative monocytosis, both of which closely mirror symptom development in time. A lymphocyte:monocyte ratio of < 2 correctly classifies 100% of influenza (but not RSV or HRV) infected subjects at the time of maximal symptoms.

Conclusions

Leukocyte differentials may suggest a viral etiology in patients with upper respiratory infection, but are not sufficient to allow differentiation between common viruses. Timing of data acquisition relative to the disease course is a key component in determining the utility of these tests.

### Myeloid / lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusion genes, version 3.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117DXTJj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions — clinical presentation includes extramedullary manifestations and systemic symptoms. EMD may present as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-ALL or B-ALL, or mixed phenotype blast phase disease and may occur alone or with chronic or blast phase disease involving bone marrow or peripheral blood, with lineage potentially differing between sites. These neoplasms are associated with a variety of symptoms, with the most common being weakness and fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgias or angioedema, rash or fever, and rhinitis, alongside blood count abnormalities such as neutrophilia, basophilia, thrombocytosis, monocytosis, myeloid immaturity, and mature or immature eosinophils with dysplasia plus anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

### CNL and aCML should be considered as a single entity based on molecular profiles and outcomes [^111Au4gq]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CNL and aCML (now renamed as MDS/MPN with neutrophilia in the fifth WHO classification but still called aCML in the International Consensus Classification), are rare myeloid neoplasms with overlapping characteristics. Despite the inclusion of molecular criteria in the 2016 WHO classification, differentiation between these entities remains problematical, and effective prognostication and treatment remain undefined. Here, we report one of the largest published cohorts of CNL and aCML cases, with 53 sequenced cases from a multicenter international study.

There were no differences in clinical presentations and outcomes of both diseases. Only the monocyte count was higher in aCML cases, which is not surprising given the fact that monocytosis is one of the exclusion criteria for CNL. The number of mutated genes was similar, and we found very few differences in the mutational profile of CNL and aCML. In fact, only 3 genes, CSF3R (one of the diagnostic criteria for CNL), EZH2, and TET2, were differentially mutated. The prevalence of TET2 and EZH2 mutations plus the high rate of cytogenetic aberrations may partly explain the monocytosis and dysplasia seen in aCML. Unfortunately, our panels did not include ETNK1, a gene reported to be mutated in aCML. When we looked into the affected pathways, no differences were found. This highlights the common molecular pathophysiology of these diseases and supports the notion of CNL and aCML being a continuum of the same disease. Of course, the minimal difference between these 2 entities might, in part, be attributable to the lack of central review of all cases, which was not possible because of the retrospective nature of our study and the long period of case collection (1986–2020). However, all cases with JAK2, SF3B1, and KIT mutations plus several others were centrally reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed. Furthermore, our results are comparable to those described in other studies, and, of note, none of the cases classified as CNL showed any evidence of dysplasia.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^111wmzrQ]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

CMML with rearranged PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2

In these patients, persistent substantial monocytosis (≥ 1.0x10 9 /L) is detected and all other consensus criteria for classical CMML (see previous paragraphs) are also met, except the following specific exclusion criteria: CMML to be excluded in the presence of a well-characterized diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with rearranged PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2 (Table 2). Except for neglecting the above-mentioned criteria, our proposal is otherwise fully in agreement with all of the other tenets postulated by the WHO classification. In relation to neoplasms with rearranged PDGFRA/B, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2, the WHO's definition of 'myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms' is too generic and there is a clinical need to know whether the underlying myeloid neoplasm is an aggressive disease, like AML, or a chronic neoplasm such as CMML or chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Our faculty is of the opinion that (unlike in previous times) the presence of one criterion-confirmed myeloid neoplasm should not a priori exclude the presence of another (second concomitant) myeloid or lymphoid neoplasm. Hence, when CMML is encountered in the context of another molecularly defined myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm (as a final diagnosis), it should be delineated as a specific subtype of the myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia along with the specific associated gene rearrangement (PDGFRA/B or FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2).

At the minimum, the findings from the current study warrant prospective monitoring of ALC and AMC during MDS clinical trials in order to determine their value as prognostic biomarkers and in providing insight into mechanism of drug action. It is possible that prognostic relevance of ALC is more or less pronounced depending on which specific lymphocyte subsets are studied and this too needs to be examined in future studies. Finally, it is important to recognize the limiting effect of multiple confounders, such as concurrent infections and use of drugs including corticosteroids, in the accurate assessment of both ALC and AMC.

### Clinical utility of classical and nonclassical monocyte percentage in the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^116HVib2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if a clinically applicable flow cytometry methodology could identify chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases.

Methods

Monocyte subset screening (CD14/CD16 expression) was performed on 68 blood and 25 bone marrow specimens with a monocytosis and/or flagged as possible CMML. Fifty thousand total events were obtained per case. Cases were categorized as CMML, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), or non-CMML + non-aCML by clinicopathologic diagnosis.

Results

The methodology differentiated blood and bone marrow CMML cases from non-CMML + non-aCML but not three aCML cases in the clinical setting. Furthermore, a decreased percentage of nonclassical monocytes (CD14dimCD16+) showed better sensitivity than the previously described approach that relied on increased percentage of classical monocytes (CD14brightCD16-).

Conclusions

Quantification of monocyte subsets is useful in clinical practice as a diagnostic marker of CMML in blood and bone marrow specimens. The percentage of nonclassical monocytes should be included in analysis of monocyte subsets.

Differential assessment of clinical and immunophenotypical parameters in established and reclassified cases

An assessment of clinical and immunophenotypical parameters was performed between WHO est and OM-CMML cases. A separate comparison of OM to ICC est cases was not performed, because we did not observe relevant differences in the composition of the WHO est and ICC est cohorts warranting a separate comparison (supplemental Tables 2.1–2.4). WHO new, compared with MD-WHO est cases, presented with significantly lower white blood cell counts (4.9 × 10 9 /L vs 7.2 × 10 9 /L; q < 0.001), absolute neutrophil counts (2.5 × 10 9 /L vs 3.3 × 10 9 /L; q < 0.001), and absolute (0.7 × 10 9 /L vs 2.0 × 10 9 /L; q < 0.001) and relative PB monocyte counts (16.2% vs 28.1%; q < 0.001; Table 1). Conversely, the WHO new cohort showed significantly higher platelet counts (197.4 × 10 9 /L vs 138.5 × 10 9 /L in MD-WHO est; q < 0.001). A small but significant difference in hemoglobin levels between WHO new and MD-WHO est cases (10.7 vs 11.3 g/dL; q < 0.001) did not affect sex-specific hemoglobin thresholds as an indicator of red blood cell transfusion dependency (q = 0.7). Finally, blast counts were significantly lower in WHO new cases, both in the PB (0.2% vs 0.4%; q < 0.001) and BM (4.0% vs 6.3%; q < 0.001). Of note, because the ICC new cohort was almost exclusively a subgroup of the WHO new cohort, all observations followed the same trends when comparing the ICC new with the WHO est or ICC est cohorts.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^116goXa1]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

CMML with JAK2 V617F

In these patients the situation is different. First, JAK2 V617F itself may be considered as a criterion of myeloproliferation in MDS/MPN, e.g. in cases with MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. In the context of CMML, the JAK2 mutation is also typically associated with other signs of myeloproliferation (including BM fibrosis) and with the 'myeloproliferative variant' of CMML. Therefore, our faculty concludes that JAK2 V617F should also count as a molecular co-criterion of MDS/MPN and thus for CMML. Second, the presence of a JAK2 -mutated MPN does not exclude the presence of a concomitant CMML if diagnostic criteria for both neoplasms are fulfilled. If this is not the case because the size of the MPN-like clone carrying JAK2 V617F is too small and/or other MPN features are clearly missing, the final diagnosis will be CMML with JAK2 V617F. On the other hand, in patients in whom the JAK2 allelic burden is high and clinical and laboratory features argue for an overt MPN rather than CMML (e.g. polycythemia and/or BM fibrosis without dysplasia and without molecular or flow cytometry-based signs of CMML) the final diagnosis will be JAK2 V617F + MPN with monocytosis. In a third group of patients, diagnostic criteria for both a distinct MPN and CMML are fulfilled and the mutation status confirms the presence of an overt JAK2 -mutated MPN (usually with high allelic burden). These patients are suffering from both MPN and CMML or from a gray zone disease displaying hybrid features between MPN and CMML. Our faculty concludes that it is therefore important to measure the JAK2 V617F allele burden in all patients with CMML. Other drivers, such as BCR-ABL1, are rarely found in patients with CMML. However, although in classical CMML, the presence of BCR-ABL1 must be excluded, it may be detected in rare patients, suggesting the existence of a special variant of CMML (defined by a co-existing chronic myeloid leukemia). In some of these cases, the chronic myeloid leukemia clone may be small. In other patients, however, the chronic myeloid leukemia may even mask the CMML at the initial diagnosis.

### Monocyte, lymphocyte and neutrophil ratios-easy-to-use biomarkers for the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis [^1168UXur]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

MLR in our study had a lower sensitivity and specificity than NLR and NLMR to distinguish between children with TB disease and nTB-LRTI. However, monocytosis and neutrophilia may be associated with a viral infection of the lower respiratory tract. It is therefore possible that the high rate of children with nTB-LRTI with viral pathogenesis resulted in many children with monocytosis and thus driving the lower sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between TB disease and nTB-LRTI controls.

The challenge remains to define optimal cutoffs for these ratios. As evidence was limited and cutoffs are highly variable in the literature, we did not use predefined cutoffs but calculated ROC curves and analyzed which cutoffs would best be suitable for our study population. Using this approach, we were able to detect TB disease in children referred for TB investigation using NLR and NMLR with sensitivities of 76%–80% and specificities of 76%–86%. Validation of these cutoffs proposed here in other settings may be useful.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^112pQdHi]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Atypical CML represents an uncommon and heterogeneous disease with overlapping features of both myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by leukocytosis (neutrophils and precursors comprising ≥ 10% of leukocytes) and prominent granulocytic dysplasia, useful in distinguishing it from CNL. Atypical CML also does not meet criteria for BCR-ABL -positive CML, demonstrates absence of PDGFRA/B and FGFR1, and presents with minimal basophilia and monocytosis.

CMML is another MPN/MDS overlap disorder whose diagnosis requires persistent (≥ 3 months) peripheral monocytosis > 1 × 10 9 /L, absence of BCR-ABL fusion or PDGFRA/B rearrangements, fewer than 20% blasts or promonocytes in blood and bone marrow, and evidence of dysplasia or clonal abnormality (or persistent monocytosis lasting ≥ 3 months with exclusion of all other causes). The chronic monocytosis and presence of dysplasia in CMML are central in distinguishing it from CNL.

Other myeloid malignancies must also be excluded, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) which each display characteristic genetic and morphological features and whose diagnostic criteria are well outlined in the revised 2016 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms.

Very rarely, paraneoplastic leukocytosis may result from ectopic production of G-CSF by certain solid tumors, mimicking the neutrophilic leukocytosis of CNL. Such cases are described primarily in association with urological malignancies such as renal cell carcinomabut have also been reported in other tumor types including lung, mesothelium –, thyroid, sarcoma, adrenal carcinoma, stomach, gallbladder, and malignant melanoma. The prognostic relevance of tumor-associated G-CSF production is uncertain, though some authors have suggested it may portend a poorer prognosis owing to G-CSF's role in autocrine growth stimulation, resulting in more aggressive tumor growth.

### Flow cytometric analysis of monocytes as a tool for distinguishing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from reactive monocytosis [^114dpHkW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether immunophenotypic features of monocytes are useful in differentiating chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) from reactive monocytosis, multiparameter flow cytometry was used to immunophenotype 20 bone marrow samples from patients with CMML, 10 normal marrow samples, and 20 marrow samples with reactive monocytosis. Monocytes in CMML exhibited aberrant antigen expression in all 20 cases. Abnormal antigen expression also was observed in monocytes in 11 of 20 reactive marrow samples. However, aberrant expression of 2 or more antigens was significantly less frequent in reactive monocytosis than in CMML (P = 0.002). CD56 expression with underexpression of a myeloid marker was unique to CMML monocytes. Subpopulations of monocytes with moderate levels of CD14 were present in all 3 groups. The proportion of CD14(moderate) monocytes was highest in CMML and was 20% or more in 13 of 20 CMML cases vs 3 of 20 reactive marrow samples (P = 0.003) and 2 of 10 normal marrow samples (P = 0.007). A combination of monocytosis with 2 or more immunophenotypic aberrancies with 20% or more of marrow monocytes showing moderate CD14 expression was 67% sensitive and 100% specific for CMML.

### Germline GATA2 mutation and bone marrow failure [^112UeeAM]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

GATA2 deficiency is an immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GATA2. It is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern or can be due to de novo sporadic germline mutation. Patients commonly have B-cell, dendritic cell, natural killer cell, and monocytopenias, and are predisposed to myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients may suffer from disseminated human papilloma virus and mycobacterial infections, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and lymphedema. The bone marrow eventually takes on a characteristic hypocellular myelodysplasia with loss of monocytes and hematogones, megakaryocytes with separated nuclear lobes, micromegakaryocytes, and megakaryocytes with hypolobated nuclei.

### Myeloid / lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions: reevaluation of the defining characteristics in a registry-based cohort [^113GtANg]. Leukemia (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of a TK fusion gene driven MLN may be missed due to the lack of eosinophilia and subsequent diverse morphological diagnoses. A significant proportion of patients were not initially diagnosed as MLN-TK or chronic eosinophilic leukemia but rather as subtype of MDS/MPN or MPN unclassified and decisive diagnostic assays such as cytogenetic analysis, FISH analysis or specific RT-PCR were not performed or only with delay. Moreover, newly available NGS technologies such as targeted RNA-sequencing, whole transcriptome or whole genome sequencing have revealed an increasing number of cytogenetically cryptic or cytogenetically difficult to identify fusion genes, e.g. ETV6::ABL1 and several fusion genes with involvement of PDGFRB.

A rarely recognized feature of MLN-TK is monocytosis > 1.0 × 10 9 /l which was identified in about one third of patients. It was clearly clustered in patients with hypereosinophilia > 1.5 × 10 9 /l and consequently in patients with FIP1L1::PDGFRA or ETV6::ABL1 fusion genes. However, only approximately 20% of these patients also had relative monocytosis ≥ 10%. Even with taking into account the new cut-off values for diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with absolute monocytosis of ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /l and relative monocytosis of ≥ 10%, these numbers did not substantially change. The data, therefore, clearly indicate that a MLN-TK may cause monocytosis but accompanying features include hypereosinophilia and relative monocytosis < 10% in the vast majority of patients (Table 5).

Besides MLN-TK, the concurrent presence of significant eosinophilia and monocytosis is also a typical feature in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis. While being the disease-defining characteristic for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, monocytosis is also identified in other myeloid neoplasms, potentially as marker of poor prognosis, e.g. in polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis and systemic mastocytosis. These data therefore also underscore the current guidelines for diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, other myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms and myeloproliferative neoplasms unclassified that the primary genetic work-up should not only exclude BCR::ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia but also cases of MLN-TK. Due to the excellent prognosis of imatinib-treated patients with PDGFRA/PDGFRB fusion genes, monocytosis had no obvious impact on progression and survival.

### CSF3R-mutant chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a distinct clinically subset with abysmal prognosis: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^1172v7Gc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) chacaterized by persistent peripheral blood monocytosis, hypercellular bone marrow and dysplasia at least in one myeloid lineage. CMML shares much of its molecular landscape with other myeloid neoplasms, while differs from others such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), given the high frequency of CSF3R mutations in the latter. In this article, we report a case of CSF3R-mutated CMML and dissect this rare entity by reviewing the medical literature, with the intent to understand how this rare mutation shapes CMML's clinical and morphological phenotype. CSF3R-mutated CMML emerges as a rare entity meeting the ICC/WHO diagnostic criteria for CMML and simultaneously showing clinical-pathological and molecular traits of CNL and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, rising an important and difficult diagnostic and therapeutical issue.

2 Evolving Classifications

The second half of the 20th century marked the emergence of multiple classifications that included chronic myeloid disorders. While Henry Rappaport's classification of malignant lymphomas began in the late 1950s, his 1966 Armed Forces Institute of Pathology monograph entitled "Tumors of the Hematopoietic System" went beyond malignant lymphoma and included myeloid neoplasms, including a category of myeloproliferative diseases and an entity of chronic monocytic leukemia. While well illustrated, the monograph did not provide specific diagnostic criteria for the entities discussed.

In 1971, the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) published its approach to the diagnosis of polycythemia vera based on red‐cell mass, arterial oxygen saturation, presence or absence of splenomegaly, platelet and white blood cell counts, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score, and serum B 12 levels. The diagnostic criteria did not include peripheral blood or bone marrow morphologic features, and a bone marrow biopsy was not required for diagnosis. The group went on to propose diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia.

In 1976, the World Health Organization (WHO), in the first edition series of the International Histological Classification of Tumors, published "Histological and Cytological Typing of Neoplastic Diseases of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues" by Mathé and Rappaport which, in many ways, was an abbreviated form of Rappaport's prior classification. It included a broad category of CML and other myeloproliferative diseases as well as chronic monocytoid (monocytic) leukemia but again, there were no real diagnostic criteria, and the classification was not widely adopted. The second edition tumor series from the WHO did not include a monograph on hematopoietic neoplasms.

Of more significance, 1976 marked the publication of the French‐American‐British Cooperative Leukemia Group (FAB) that provided detailed diagnostic criteria for acute leukemia, followed in subsequent years by the publication of criteria for a number of disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other chronic myeloid disorders. The FAB elevated what was called up to that time preleukemia to myelodysplastic syndrome with specific criteria on blast percentages, establishing a variety of disease categories ranging from refractory anemia to refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. The FAB also included chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as a type of MDS. In 1994, the same group described atypical CML, providing criteria for differentiating it from chronic granulocytic leukemia (now known as CML) and CMML.

### Monocytosis in congenital syphilis… [^1131ARja]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We evaluated hematological findings, with special reference to the monocyte count, in ten infants with congenital syphilis. One patient had a monocytic leukemoid reaction and eight had absolute monocyte counts considerably higher than normal control infants. Monocytes appear to be an essential participant in the cellular reaction to treponema pallidum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a monocytic leukemoid reaction in congenital syphilis.

### Myelodysplastic syndrome presenting as generalized granulomatous dermatitis… [^112UQaXm]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Observations A 71-year-old man developed a generalized, mildly pruritic eruption that slowly progressed over a 2-year period. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated interstitial dermal granulomatous inflammation. A complete blood cell count with differential showed marked monocytosis, and the findings of a subsequent biopsy of the bone marrow confirmed MDS. Lenalidomide therapy was initiated, and the patient's skin condition improved after 6 weeks of treatment; however, his MDS progressed to acute myeloid leukemia, and he died shortly thereafter. Extensive laboratory evaluations were performed. Abnormalities were found in values for monocytes, neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin, glucose, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody. Because of the markedly increased monocyte count in the peripheral blood, in conjunction with the patient's skin findings, weight loss, and adenopathy noted on computed tomograms, a bone marrow biopsy specimen was obtained.

The biopsy specimen showed increased monocytes, promonocytes, and blast cells, consistent with a diagnosis of MDS. Cytogenetic studies showed no abnormalities. Treatment with lenalidomide was initiated, and after 6 weeks, the patient's skin condition improved. During the 12 weeks between his initial evaluation at our institution and completion of 6 weeks of treatment with lenalidomide, his peripheral monocyte count decreased from 42% to 7%, but his leukocyte count increased from 6200/μL to 18 800/μL and contained 63% blast cells. It is unclear whether the granulomatous dermatitis in the present case represents a novel form of leukemia cutis or a cutaneous reaction due to the underlying MDS. On the basis of the observed cutaneous histopathologic findings, we suspect that the monocytes initially causing the peripheral monocytosis were the same as most of the cells making up the granulomatous cutaneous infiltrate.

We believe that these cells were different from the dysplastic cells in the bone marrow sample because the granulomatous dermatitis improved with the resolution of the peripheral monocytosis, whereas the dysplastic blast cells increased in the peripheral blood sample during this time. Unfortunately, the leukemic cells in the bone marrow sample lacked specific fluorescence in situ hybridization markers; therefore, we were unable to definitively show that these cells were not the same ones that caused the granulomatous dermatitis.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), NOS… [^117UqaPM]. seer.cancer.gov (2015). Low credibility.

Abstractor Notes The peripheral blood and bone marrow are always involved. The spleen, liver, skin and lymph nodes are the most common sites of extramedullary infiltration. The peripheral blood has persistent monocytosis. There are fewer than 20% blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The physician will run tests to exclude the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, the rearrangement of PDGFRA or PDGFRB. The physician uses the information from these tests to do a diagnosis of exclusion of Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. For more information, see the NCI website: https: //www. cancer. gov/types/myeloproliferative/hp/mds-mpd-treatment-pdq#section/_6ThephysicianwillrunteststoexcludetheBCR-ABL1fusiongene, therearrangementofPDGFRAorPDGFRB.
