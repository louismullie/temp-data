## Question

recommendation mumps igg is low

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what recommendations to follow when a mumps IgG result is low. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a low mumps IgG actually means and whether it correlates with protection. Then, I should verify the standard adult MMR vaccination recommendations and whether a third dose is indicated outside of outbreaks. Next, I will consider special populations such as immunocompromised patients, people with HIV, pregnancy planning, and healthcare workers. After that, I should review the role and timing of serologic testing and its limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and address common pitfalls in interpretation and testing strategy.

> Let me first confirm what a low mumps IgG signifies. Wait, let me verify the key point: there is no established serologic correlate of protection for mumps, so a low or even negative mumps IgG does not reliably indicate susceptibility, and a positive IgG does not guarantee protection, especially in previously vaccinated adults whose titers wane over time [^1115H1pv] [^115HQCfy]. I should double-check the waning data: vaccine effectiveness against mumps is about 88% after two doses and declines with time since the second dose, and antibody titers can fall substantially within a year after boosting, underscoring that IgG alone is an imperfect marker of immunity [^1157VUnA] [^117QsotN].

> Next, I should review the standard adult recommendations. For adults without acceptable evidence of immunity, routine practice is to give 1 dose of MMR; for those at higher risk of exposure or transmission (students, international travelers, healthcare personnel), 2 doses separated by at least 28 days are recommended, and birth before 1957 is generally considered presumptive evidence of immunity for measles and rubella but not necessarily for mumps, so documentation or vaccination is preferred when feasible [^113QVvGf]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance about birth year: while many programs accept pre-1957 as presumptive immunity for measles and rubella, for mumps, ACIP emphasizes documentation of vaccination or laboratory evidence, so relying on birth year alone for mumps can be risky in outbreak-prone settings [^115CSBvH].

> Now, about a third dose: I need to ensure I'm precise. ACIP recommends a third dose of a mumps-containing vaccine only for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses who are identified by public health authorities as being at increased risk during a mumps outbreak; this is not a routine recommendation outside of outbreak settings, and evidence suggests antibody gains after dose 3 tend to wane within a year, so durability remains uncertain [^115ZGVtm] [^111vXVij] [^117QsotN]. Let me reconsider whether any broader endorsement exists: current ACIP schedules and CDC guidance do not recommend routine third doses for all adults, reinforcing that the third dose is outbreak-specific rather than a universal booster strategy [^113QVvGf] [^113Tf6WT].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with immunocompromised patients. For persons with HIV, MMR is indicated only if the CD4 count is at least 200 cells/mm3 and there is no severe immunosuppression; it is contraindicated when CD4 is below 200, and if prior MMR was given before effective ART, revaccination with two appropriately spaced doses after immune reconstitution is advised [^117TYgEk] [^111adnCy]. But wait, what if the patient is on B-cell depleting therapy or has undergone transplantation? Live vaccines are generally avoided in severe immunosuppression; after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, MMR is considered only after immune reconstitution and typically no sooner than 2 years post-transplant without active GVHD, with individualized timing and avoidance of recent IVIG that could blunt response [^117QETUc] [^113Ew5ow] [^11475r95].

> For pregnancy planning, I should confirm the timing. MMR is contraindicated during pregnancy, and women should avoid conception for 1 month after vaccination; preconception vaccination is recommended to prevent rubella and mumps in pregnancy, and inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy is not an indication for termination [^111NGtoP] [^115ax2es]. Hold on, I should verify the waiting period: ACIP specifies a 4-week interval after MMR before attempting pregnancy, which aligns with the 1-month guidance in reproductive care statements [^111NGtoP] [^111adnCy].

> For healthcare personnel, I need to check the evidence requirements. Occupational health programs generally require documented immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella via two documented MMR doses, laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory confirmation of disease; in outbreak settings, even those born before 1957 without other evidence of immunity may be vaccinated, and pre-vaccination serologic screening solely for mumps is not routinely recommended because of assay limitations and the lack of a correlate of protection [^115CSBvH] [^117G9gto]. Hmm, wait a minute, could a low mumps IgG prompt a booster at hire? No, standard practice is to ensure two documented doses or other acceptable evidence; a low mumps IgG alone should not trigger a third dose outside of an outbreak context [^115CSBvH] [^113Tf6WT].

> Next, I should review the role and limitations of serologic testing. I should confirm that routine post-vaccination serology for mumps is discouraged because available assays are not validated against a correlate of protection and cannot distinguish functional neutralizing antibodies; moreover, in vaccinated persons, IgM may be absent during acute infection, and IgG may already be elevated at presentation, making serodiagnosis challenging and necessitating nucleic acid testing when disease is suspected [^113AFvSs] [^115HQCfy] [^1179hgPA]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach: in suspected mumps, collect a buccal swab for rRT-PCR and consider serum IgM, recognizing that PCR is preferred and that timing and specimen quality affect yield, especially in previously vaccinated individuals [^117G9gto] [^11623kgh].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach for an adult with low mumps IgG. First, I should confirm vaccination history; if there is no documentation of two MMR doses, give the missing dose(s) at least 28 days apart, prioritizing two doses for those in higher-risk categories such as students, healthcare workers, or travelers [^112oDf7Q] [^113QVvGf]. If two documented doses were given previously, I should not order routine serology and should not administer a third dose unless the person is identified by public health as being at increased risk during an outbreak, in which case a targeted third dose is reasonable given short-term effectiveness and acceptable safety profile [^115ZGVtm] [^111vXVij] [^113Tf6WT]. If the patient is immunocompromised, I need to ensure eligibility for live vaccination and consider revaccination strategies after immune reconstitution; if pregnancy is planned, vaccinate before conception with a 4-week waiting period afterward [^117TYgEk] [^111NGtoP].

> I should double-check common pitfalls. A low mumps IgG should not be overinterpreted as "unprotected", and a positive IgG should not be overinterpreted as "protected", given the absence of a correlate of protection and the frequency of waning titers after vaccination; therefore, management should be driven by documented vaccination history and outbreak risk rather than isolated serology results [^1115H1pv] [^115HQCfy]. But wait, what if the patient insists on a booster because of anxiety about low titers? I should counsel that routine third doses are not recommended outside outbreaks, that antibody rises after dose 3 often decline within a year, and that the clinical benefit is best demonstrated in outbreak settings with intense exposures, reinforcing a risk-based rather than titer-based approach [^117QsotN] [^113Tf6WT].

> Final recommendation: For an adult with a low mumps IgG, I should confirm MMR vaccination history; if fewer than two documented doses were given, administer the missing dose(s) with appropriate spacing; if two doses are documented, no immediate action is required outside of an outbreak, but if public health identifies the person as being at increased risk during a mumps outbreak, a third dose can be offered with counseling about short-term benefit and waning; throughout, avoid using mumps IgG alone to make decisions, and tailor actions to exposure risk, immune status, and pregnancy plans [^112oDf7Q] [^115ZGVtm] [^115HQCfy].

A low mumps IgG in a vaccinated adult indicates **waning immunity** [^1157VUnA] and does not reliably predict susceptibility, as no serologic correlate of protection exists for mumps [^1115H1pv] [^115HQCfy]. Routine **booster dosing is not recommended** outside outbreak settings; however, if the patient is part of an outbreak or at high risk, a **third MMR dose** may be given to reduce risk, with the understanding that antibody titers often decline within a year [^115ZGVtm] [^111vXVij] [^117QsotN]. For non-outbreak settings, prioritize documentation of two MMR doses and counsel on exposure risk; **serologic testing is not routinely indicated** and should not guide revaccination decisions [^112oDf7Q] [^111jemZK].

---

## Clinical significance of low mumps IgG

- **Waning immunity**: Vaccine-induced mumps immunity wanes over time, with declining antibody titers observed in adults who received two MMR doses in childhood [^1157VUnA] [^113Tf6WT].

- **No correlate of protection**: There is no established serologic correlate of protection for mumps; thus, low or negative IgG does not reliably indicate susceptibility [^1115H1pv] [^115HQCfy].

- **Outbreak risk**: Waning immunity contributes to outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations, particularly in close-contact settings such as universities and communal living environments [^113Tf6WT].

---

## Current recommendations for mumps vaccination in adults

According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the **routine schedule** is two MMR doses for adults without evidence of immunity, administered at least 28 days apart [^112oDf7Q]. A **third dose** is recommended only for persons previously vaccinated with two doses who are identified by public health authorities as being at increased risk during an outbreak [^115ZGVtm] [^111vXVij].

---

## Clinical implications of low mumps IgG

- **Susceptibility**: Low mumps IgG levels may indicate increased susceptibility to mumps infection, particularly in outbreak settings or environments with prolonged close contact [^notfound].

- **Waning immunity**: Declining antibody titers over time contribute to reduced vaccine effectiveness, especially in high-intensity exposure settings typical of outbreaks [^1157VUnA].

- **Complications**: Mumps infection can lead to complications such as orchitis, meningitis, and pancreatitis, even in vaccinated individuals [^112kynYT].

---

## Management strategies for low mumps IgG

- **Documentation**: Ensure the patient has documented receipt of two MMR doses. If documentation is incomplete, administer the missing dose(s) [^112oDf7Q].

- **Outbreak settings**: In outbreak settings or for individuals at increased risk, consider administering a third MMR dose to improve protection against mumps disease and related complications [^115ZGVtm] [^111vXVij].

- **Counseling**: Educate patients about mumps transmission, symptoms, and the importance of vaccination adherence [^112gY56u].

---

## Limitations of serologic testing for mumps immunity

- **No correlate of protection**: Serologic testing for mumps-specific IgG antibodies does not reliably predict protection against mumps infection [^1115H1pv] [^115HQCfy].

- **Assay variability**: Different laboratories use various assays, leading to variability in results and interpretation [^1179hgPA] [^114HbEno].

- **Limited availability**: Quantitative or semi-quantitative mumps IgG testing is not routinely available in many clinical settings [^113AFvSs].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A low mumps IgG in a vaccinated adult reflects **waning immunity** and does not reliably indicate susceptibility. Routine administration of a third MMR dose is not recommended outside outbreak settings; however, in outbreak or high-risk settings, a third dose may be considered to reduce infection risk, with the understanding that antibody titers may decline within a year. Clinicians should prioritize documentation of two MMR doses, counsel patients on exposure risk, and avoid routine serologic testing for mumps immunity.

Mumps — serology-based diagnosis, timing, and when to confirm by virologic testing: Although considered eliminated in the United States, the mumps vaccine "has a protective rate of ~88% following administration of the 2 doses". Immunity is "suggested by the presence of anti-mumps IgG-class antibodies", and diagnosis can be supported by "a positive serologic test for anti-mumps IgM antibodies and/or seroconversion or a 4-fold rise of mumps IgG antibody levels between acute and convalescent phase sera". For timing, "acute phase sera should be collected immediately… and convalescent sera collected approximately 5–10 days thereafter", with IgM that "peak approximately 1 week post onset". Quantitative or semi-quantitative mumps IgG testing "is no longer routinely available" locally, and "previously immunized patients… may not develop a detectable IgM response", so confirmation "requires isolation of the virus itself or detection of viral RNA", tests "largely limited to public health laboratories and the CDC".

Recommendation

Persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses of a mumps virus–containing vaccine who are identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak should receive a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine to improve protection against mumps disease and related complications.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^111vXVij]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Available evidence indicates that a third dose of MMR vaccine improves protection for persons at increased risk for mumps because of an outbreak. Because of the complexity of mumps outbreaks, including the setting, the group or population affected, and risk factors for transmission, public health authorities are uniquely positioned to advise parents, students, clinicians, and universities regarding when and for which groups a third dose of MMR vaccine is appropriate. At this time, evidence is limited and is not sufficient to fully characterize the effect of a third dose of MMR vaccine on reducing the size or duration of an outbreak, nor are any data available to demonstrate the duration of additional protection conferred by a third dose. In addition, limited immunologic evidence suggests antibody titers decline within 1 year after the third dose. As more data on duration of protection after receipt of the third dose become available, evidence for use of a routine third dose will be considered. No evidence is available regarding the benefit of an additional dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine to persons with documentation of receipt of 3 previous doses; therefore, no additional dose is recommended for persons in outbreak settings who have already received ≥ 3 doses of a mumps virus–containing vaccine.

### Long-term immunogenicity of measles vaccine: an Italian retrospective cohort study [^1121HTQy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, 93.4% of subjects without circulating anti-measles IgG at enrollment gained a protective titer after 1 or 2 booster doses. Our strategy seemed consistent with the purpose of eliciting protection in a subgroup with high risk of exposure (HCWs) and additional risk of complications (young adults). The low percentage of nonresponders received a specific recommendation of being evaluated in case of exposure, in particular if male or at high risk of complications.

The time between vaccination doses and the antibody titer evaluation is a determinant for persisting circulating antibodies; in particular, the time from the second dose to the antibody titer evaluation seems to be the main determinant of the persistence of circulating antibodies, with a major role compared to age at the time of the first dose of MMR vaccine. Therefore, the antibody titer and immunity decrease over the years, as already described for the anti–hepatitis B virus, anti-pertussis, and anti-mumps vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, the introduction of booster dose(s) in fully vaccinated but not measles-seroprotected subjects among HCWs is a topic not studied in the literature. Few official recommendations are available regarding the use of a third dose of MMR vaccine in other contexts; indeed, many studies showed that a booster dose of MMR vaccine in fully vaccinated subjects is safe and effective in preventing mumps infection in subjects exposed in close settings during outbreaks. The strengths of our study include the relevant sample size, the topic being poorly studied in the literature, and the comparison based on the age of the first dose; furthermore, the issue of vaccinations in nonresponder HCWs is of great importance in future decisions on vaccination strategies. The major limitation is related to the impossibility to analyze the subjects' immunostatus in relation to the commercial type of MMR vaccine, and it was not possible to evaluate if the subject had ever come into contact with wild virus. Moreover, a topic of discussion in the literature is the role of cell-mediated immunity in long-term response to the vaccine and protection against measles; therefore, hypothetically, a vaccinated subject not providing circulating antibodies could be immune. Ruckdeschel et al asserted that the lymphocyte responsiveness to measles complement fixation antigen seen in 2 pediatric residents who had negative anti-measles IgG titers and who had frequent exposure to patients affected by measles is the in vitro correlate of their clinical protection against infection. Nevertheless, a recent study asserts that the contribution of T cells to protection is generally considered minor in comparison to neutralizing antibodies, so more studies are needed to clarify this point.

### Mumps outbreaks: a problem in need of solutions [^111Q32nA]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To discuss what is presently known about recent mumps outbreaks and what solutions can be suggested to ensure more complete protection against mumps.

Methods

PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words "mumps" or "mumps virus" or "mumps vaccine". More than 1500 articles were found, but only those published in English or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.

Results

Prevention of mumps remains an unsolved problem. Available vaccines are effective but the protection they evoke declines over time. The use of booster doses can control outbreaks but it is not precisely defined whether they can prevent them. The rapid decline of antibody levels could limit the impact of the introduction of a third dose in the recommended immunization schedule. Furthermore, in most of the areas, mumps viral strains that are genetically different from those included in the vaccines are emerging and this might favour vaccine escape. However, also for this problem, its real relevance in favouring outbreak development is not precisely defined.

Conclusions

The true reasons for the development of mumps outbreaks in people with very high vaccination coverage are not clearly understood. The use of a booster dose or the preparation of vaccines containing the emerging serotypes are possible solutions, but both have some limitations. Further studies mainly devoted to improve our knowledge of the immune response to mumps vaccines are needed before long-term effective mumps vaccines can be prepared and outbreaks can be avoided.

### Are boosters necessary If adult patients Do not achieve seroconversion after 2 doses of the MMR vaccine? [^111aomwo]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend 2 documented doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine for adequate measles, mumps, and rubella immunity for all children and most adults. Sometimes, individuals are asked to provide serologic proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella for educational or employment purposes. In other instances, serologic testing may be used to help clarify whether an individual has immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella. These serologic tests may sometimes show negative or equivocal antibody titers to measles, mumps and/or rubella, raising the question of adequate immunity. This report provides practical guidance for clinicians on when to use serologic testing to determine measles, mumps, and rubella immunity.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^115ax2es]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Vaccination before infertility treatment and during pregnancy — immunizations should be completed before conception because some recommended vaccinations cannot be administered during pregnancy; vaccinations before or during pregnancy protect individuals, prevent vertical transmission to the fetus, and confer passive immunity, with maternal immunoglobulin (IgG) transfer increasing markedly during the last 4–6 weeks of gestation. During pregnancy, few vaccines are contraindicated and the contraindicated vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, and herpes zoster; vaccinations during pregnancy are indicated when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and guidance for special indications is outlined in a committee opinion published by the CDC.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^117QsotN]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two studies evaluated the geometric mean titers of mumps virus–specific antibodies after the third dose of MMR vaccine and demonstrated a significant increase (p < 0.0001) 1 month after vaccination; however, antibody titers declined to near baseline by 1 year after vaccination. In the absence of a correlate of protection that would define the level of antibodies needed to protect a person from mumps disease, the clinical significance of these laboratory findings is unclear.

Five studies evaluated the safety of the third dose of MMR vaccine among children and young adults (aged 9–28 years) using passive and active surveillance for adverse events (J. Routh, CDC, personal communication, 2017) (,–). No serious adverse events were reported among 14,368 persons who received a third MMR vaccine dose. Nonserious adverse events were mild and reported at low rates. Among children, 6%–7% reported at least one nonserious adverse event within 2 weeks after receiving the third dose. Among young adults who received a third dose, the prevalences of four symptoms were significantly elevated during the 4-week postvaccination period compared with the prevaccination period. These symptoms and estimated proportions of subjects with episodes attributable to receipt of the third dose were lymphadenopathy (12%), diarrhea (9%), headache (7%), and joint pain (6%). The median duration of these episodes was short (1–3 days).

Stakeholders' Values, Acceptability, and Implementation Considerations. During July–September 2017, CDC conducted surveys of stakeholders, including students and parents, universities and colleges, and health departments to assess values, acceptability, and considerations for implementation of a third MMR vaccine dose during mumps outbreaks. Because the response rates for the student and parent surveys were very low (< 0.5% in one university that agreed to participate), thereby limiting reliability of the results, the values regarding the benefits and harms of using a third dose to prevent mumps from the perspective of these stakeholders was based on expert opinion. Experts concluded that students and parents place high value on preventing mumps and its complications as well as preventing the harms associated with loss of productivity that can occur with mumps disease. Experts also concluded students and parents do not have concerns about safety of a third dose of MMR vaccine.

### Titerphilia-the irresistible urge to measure postimmunization antibody values [^111jemZK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Some physicians and parents request to measure antimeasles serum IgG antibodies after measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. Often, vaccine skeptical parents want to know if their child is "immune" after the first dose to avoid the second dose. In the usual healthy child, this should be discouraged for the following reasons. Commercially available antibody assays do not measure functional (neutralizing) antibodies. They cannot reliably measure immunity against measles and were designed to measure naturally acquired antibodies rather than those induced by vaccination. Furthermore, MMR also includes mumps and rubella vaccine viruses, which also require 2 doses for optimal protection; there is no reliable serologic correlate of protection for mumps. Therefore, the 2-dose MMR immunization concept is by far more effective, efficient and reliable than a single dose strategy based on a post-dose 1 positive anti-measles-IgG test. Consequently, physicians should resist the desire to measure antimeasles IgG antibodies unless there is a clear indication (e.g., immunodeficiency) or official recommendation as part of the national immunization program.

METHODS

Study Participants and Serum Samples

The serum samples used in this study were derived from a randomized, observer-blind study of the immunogenicity and safety of MMR vaccine formulations administered to 4516 children in their second year of life (NCT01681992), as described elsewhere. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by a national, regional, or investigational center institutional review board or independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legally acceptable representatives before enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive MMR-RIT or MMR II, with the first dose administered at 12–15 months of age. The serum samples analyzed were from blood samples obtained before vaccination and 42 days after the first of the 2 MMR doses administered.

Serologic assessment after suspected vaccine reaction — Summary Statement 4 (B) states that measuring levels of IgG antibodies to the immunizing agent in a vaccine suspected of causing a serious adverse reaction to determine whether they are at protective levels can help determine whether subsequent doses are required; such levels have been established for some but not all vaccines and may be available from diagnostic laboratories, and if serologic evidence of immunity is documented, consideration can be given to withholding additional doses although immunity might be less than if all doses were received; even if recommended doses or protective levels have already been achieved, evaluation of the reaction, including skin testing if indicated, should be undertaken.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination in people with HIV — Individuals who lack immunity and have CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 should receive two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days; the combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine has not been studied in immunocompromised hosts and should not be administered to people with HIV. The MMR vaccine is contraindicated for people with HIV with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, and for people with HIV with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 the vaccine has been shown to be safe, although antibody response may be lower than for patients without HIV; the MMR vaccine is also contraindicated for people with other immunocompromised conditions.

### Seroprevalence of measles and mumps antibodies among individuals with cancer [^111au8DE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The highly contagious nature of measles and mumps combined with the vulnerability of patients with cancer observed in this study highlight the need to increase community immunity in the United States. Efforts to increase vaccine education across diverse populations and to improve vaccine policy and support of childhood vaccination can help protect those who either have limited benefit from or cannot receive MMR vaccination. In addition, findings from this study underscore the need for national standards that require MMR vaccination or documented seropositivity among health care practitioners who work with patients with cancer.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, antibody testing is often used as a surrogate for immunity, but IgG seropositivity may not adequately measure actual immunity, especially for mumps. Given the complex immune responses necessary for protection, true immunity levels may be underestimated. We were also unable to confirm MMR vaccination history among most patients and were therefore unable to draw conclusions regarding the association of vaccination (or revaccination) with seroprevalence in this cohort. However, this limitation is common in most seroprevalence studies of vaccine-preventable diseases, in which vaccine recall can be inaccurate even among pediatric populations. Second, the study population included only patients during a specific period who underwent clinical blood draws from which residual plasma samples were available for testing. Although we tested the samples from all consecutive patients available during this period at a laboratory that serves all clinics within the cancer center, we may not have fully captured every patient who did not undergo blood draws as part of their routine clinical care (ie, patients returning for cancer survivorship). Furthermore, this approach limited our ability to look at the differences between specific cancer subtypes and treatments. In addition, the cancer center cares for a small pediatric population (primarily for HCT), which hampered our ability to include these young patients.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — In adults and adolescents with HIV with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and no evidence of immunity to MMR, a two-dose series (0.5 mL SQ) of MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart (AIII) is specified; MMR vaccine is contraindicated if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (AIII) and MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Evidence of immunity includes birth date before 1957, documentation of receipt of MMR vaccine, or laboratory evidence of immunity or disease for each pathogen. For measles post-exposure, for nonimmune individuals with CD4 count ≥ 200 cells mm3, administer MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or IG within 6 days of exposure and do not administer MMR vaccine and IG simultaneously; for nonimmune individuals with CD4 count < 200 cells mm3 or who are pregnant, administer IG within 6 days of exposure. For pregnant women without immunity to rubella, after pregnancy, administer two doses of MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and on ART (AIII). ACIP recommendations indicate no difference in recommendations.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^1175BvAY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial increase in the number of mumps outbreaks and outbreak-associated cases has occurred in the United States since late 2015 (1,2). To address this public health problem, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the available evidence and determined that a third dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective at preventing mumps. During its October 2017 meeting, ACIP recommended a third dose of a mumps virus-containing vaccine* for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses who are identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak. The purpose of the recommendation is to improve protection of persons in outbreak settings against mumps disease and mumps-related complications. This recommendation supplements the existing ACIP recommendations for mumps vaccination (3).

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^115Bi1AB]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination (2017)

The use of live vaccines is discouraged during immunosuppressive therapy (Table 3). 24 Exceptions can be made in specific circumstances (e.g. for mumps, measles, rubella and varicella in specific cases), in consultation with a vaccine specialist. In patients with immunosuppressive therapy, it is recommended that (live) vaccines, except for the yearly influenza vaccine, be given in consultation with a specialist in the field of vaccinations/immunology/travel diseases; additional measures may be necessary (e.g. titre control in common vaccines, live vaccine measures). Vaccines should preferably be administered before starting immunosuppressants.

Table 3
Advice on duration between stopping immunosuppressant and administration of live vaccine in adult patients

It is advised to wait for at least 4 weeks after a live vaccine to (re)start immunosuppressive medication. 3, 24, 25, 26 Beware of live vaccinations in newborns of mothers treated with immunosuppressive therapy, as it might be necessary to postpone live vaccines.

Pregnancy (2017)

The time a woman should wait to conceive after stopping biological therapy depends on the half‐life of the drug.

Recommendations Our recommendations are summarized in Table 4. We suggest starting or continuing biological therapy in pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment. In such cases there is a slight preference for etanercept given the short half‐life and the relatively low transplacental transfer to the fetus. It is recommended that biologics be stopped, especially the IgG immunoglobulins such as infliximab and adalimumab, before the end of the second trimester to minimize the risk of neonatal immunosuppression.

Table 4
Advice on contraception a

Pregnancy in a woman treated with a biologic requires a multidisciplinary approach, therefore counselling by a gynaecologist is recommended. It might be necessary to postpone administration of live vaccinations and bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccinations in neonates exposed to biologics in utero, especially in the third trimester. Pregnant patients treated with biologics should preferably be treated in an academic hospital. Data on pregnancy should preferably be kept in a registry.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111adnCy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — Administer two doses of MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart to people with a CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and who have no evidence of immunity to MMR (AIII), with evidence of immunity defined as: patient was born before 1957 and/or had documentation of receipt of MMR vaccine and/or has laboratory evidence of immunity or disease. The MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy, and women of childbearing potential who get the MMR vaccine should wait 4 weeks before getting pregnant. For pregnant women without immunity to rubella, delay immunization until after pregnancy, and then administer two doses of the MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart if the CD4 count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AIII). If no serologic evidence of immunity exists after two doses of MMR vaccine, consider repeating the two-dose MMR vaccine series, especially if the person is vaccinated while not virologically suppressed (CIII). Do not administer MMR vaccine to people with HIV with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 or uncontrolled HIV (not on ART or virologic failure) (AIII).

### British society for immunology and United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy [^1148vanb]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 30

Patients with secondary immunodeficiency treated with IgRT who continue to have a high infection burden despite trough IgG level in the normal range should have other treatments optimised (e.g. antibiotic prophylaxis, physical therapy) prior to immunoglobulin dose increase.

Recommendation 31

Immunoglobulin dose increases should be undertaken on a trial basis for 6–12 months, with a reduction to the previous dose if there is no measurable improvement in clinical infection burden.

Recommendation 32

Immunoglobulin dose decreases should be undertaken on a trial basis for 6–12 months, with a return to the previous dose if there is a significant increase in infection frequency.

For primary immunodeficiency there was strong consensus from the first round that patients' trough IgG levels should be maintained at over 8 g/L. Comments highlighted that infection monitoring was important, and that many patients were well controlled with much lower IgG levels. Despite these reservations regarding an 8 g/L threshold, there was an even stronger consensus that trough levels of over 10 g/L were necessary in some PIDs and SIDs.

Two rounds of questions regarding a minimal target trough IgG level for SID patients did not achieve consensus. In the first round a range of options (6, 7 and 8 g/L) were offered in a single question. While there was a majority in favour of the lower limit, there was no consensus. Many respondents appeared to agree with more than one suggested trough level. Therefore, in the second round target trough levels of 6 g/L and 8 g/L were offered in separate questions. Again, slightly more respondents favoured the lower figure, but without reaching consensus criteria. It seems that lower levels of IgRT are considered adequate in SID patients than in PID patients, although several comments acknowledged that there is little or no evidence to support any choice of optimum trough level.

### British society for immunology and United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy [^112VrFmW]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 5

If IgG is < 4 g/L with poor vaccine responses, IgRT should be considered unless the patient has a low frequency or severity of infection.

Recommendation 6

If IgG is < 4 g/L with preserved vaccine responses, IgRT should not be routinely started unless the patient has recurrent and/or significant infection despite prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months and optimised medical management and/or radiologically confirmed bronchiectasis.

Recommendation 7

In patients with primary immunodeficiency and increased burden of infection, if IgG is < 2 g/L, IgRT may be started without a trial of prophylactic antibiotics.

Note that this statement did not achieve consensus for secondary immunodeficiency.

Recommendation 8:

If IgG is < 2 g/L, vaccine response testing is unlikely to be helpful and IgRT should be considered unless the patient has low IgG due to protein loss (where vaccine responses may be preserved).

These consensus statements provide a framework on which to base clinical decisions. It is recognised that using IgG levels with defined cut offs (eg 2 or 4 g/l) relies on arbitrarily chosen threshold values and is not evidence based. It should be emphasised (and was highlighted in the comments from respondents) that any treatment decision should be individualised taking into account the full clinical picture. Respondents to the Dephi survey commented that vaccine response assessment is not straightforward and a number of responses highlighted the importance of the clinical context. There was consensus that vaccine responses may not be useful if IgG levels were below 2g/l, but also agreement that if in this situation the vaccine responses had been checked and found to be reduced this would provide further support to the use of immunoglobulin in primary immunodeficiency.

Although reaching consensus, concerns were expressed about the statement regarding 6 months of prophylactic antibiotics, highlighting that there is no evidence to support the 6 month time interval and that in some cases a shorter period of treatment with prophylactic antibiotics may be sufficient to demonstrate the need for IgRT.

Respondents also highlighted that bronchiectasis has a number of causes that do not respond to immunoglobulin and can be managed with respiratory therapy, and therefore the alternative causes and management of bronchiectasis should be considered at the same time as immunoglobulin therapy. Ideally treatment should be initiated before end organ damage such as bronchiectasis occurs, but it is recognised that diagnostic delays in immunodeficiency mean that this is not always possible.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^1157VUnA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two-Dose Mumps Vaccine Effectiveness and Immune Response. The median effectiveness of 2 doses of MMR vaccine in preventing mumps is 88%, with estimates ranging from 31% to 95% (,–). The studies reporting these findings were conducted during 2005–2016, and most included persons who received the second MMR dose < 10 years before the study. Several studies found decreasing effectiveness with increasing time after receipt of the second dose or reported increased risk for mumps with increasing time after receipt of the second dose. Limited laboratory data on immune response to mumps virus indicate both lower antibody titers and poorer antibody quality (e.g. lower avidity antibodies, failure to generate strong memory B cell responses) after either natural mumps infection or mumps vaccination compared with the responses to infection with or vaccination against measles and rubella. Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing mean mumps antibody titers decline over time in persons who have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (,–).

Since 2006, the predominant circulating mumps virus genotype in the United States has been genotype G. Mumps virus–containing vaccines available in the United States are manufactured using the genotype A Jeryl-Lynn mumps virus strain. When studied 4–6 weeks and 10 years after receipt of the second MMR dose at age 4–6 years, all recipients had neutralizing antibody against genotype G mumps strain; however, the geometric mean titers of antibodies were lower than those against the vaccine strain.

Third Dose of MMR Vaccine. Three epidemiologic studies provided evidence regarding use of a third dose of MMR vaccine for prevention of mumps, all conducted in outbreak settings among populations with high coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine (schools and a university). All studies reported lower attack rates among persons who received the third dose during the outbreak compared with persons who had received 2 doses before the outbreak, but only one study found a statistically significant risk ratio (6.7 versus 14.5 per 1,000 person-years; p < 0.001). Incremental vaccine effectiveness of the third versus the second MMR dose in these studies ranged from 61% to 88%, with one estimate being statistically significant (78.1%, 95% confidence interval = 60.9%–87.8%). This study also found that students who had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine ≥ 13 years before the outbreak had nine or more times the risk for contracting mumps than did those who had received the second dose within the 2 years preceding the outbreak.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2018 [^113QVvGf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Consistent with the existing recommended use of ZVL, ACIP recommended RZV for adults who are receiving low-dose (< 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or short-term (< 14 days of corticosteroids) immunosuppressive therapy, are anticipating immunosuppression, or have recovered from an immunocompromising illness. The clinical trials for RZV did not exclude adults with non-immunocompromising chronic health conditions. Therefore, given the safety and effectiveness profiles of other conjugate vaccines recommended for adults (e.g. hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccines), ACIP recommended that RZV should routinely be used for age-eligible adults with diabetes mellitus; chronic heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease; functional or anatomical asplenia; or complement deficiencies.

MMR Vaccination. On 25 October, ACIP updated MMR vaccination recommendations to include the use of a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses of a mumps virus–containing vaccine who are identified by public health authorities as being a part of a group or population at risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak. During a mumps outbreak, persons identified as being at increased risk and who have received ≤ 2 doses of mumps virus–containing vaccine or whose mumps vaccination status is unknown should receive 1 dose of MMR. This change is described in the 2018 adult immunization schedule as follows:

Administer 1 dose of MMR to adults who previously received ≤ 2 doses of mumps virus–containing vaccine and are identified by a public health authority to be at increased risk during a mumps outbreak.

Adults without evidence of immunity to mumps (defined as birth before 1957, documentation of receipt of MMR, or laboratory evidence of immunity or disease) are routinely recommended to receive 1 dose of MMR for mumps prevention. However, students in postsecondary educational institutions, international travelers, or household contacts of immunocompromised persons should receive 2 doses of MMR at least 28 days apart. In a mumps outbreak setting, those adults identified by a public health authority to be at risk should receive 1 dose of MMR regardless of whether they previously received 0, 1, or 2 doses of a mumps virus–containing vaccine.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) re-immunization and vaccine response after antiretroviral therapy (ART) — children with HIV: For certain vaccines the response to vaccination may be greater with immune reconstitution following ART and may vary with viral load, and for most vaccines patients with higher CD4 counts have improved immune response with response likely improved after ART is initiated. The ACIP made specific recommendations for routine MMR re-immunization after initiation of ART; individuals with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated prior to establishment of effective ART should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established unless severely immunosuppressed or with other acceptable current evidence of measles immunity. For some vaccines such as hepatitis B, ACIP recommends performing post-vaccination serology to ensure immune response, and children living in a household with an adult or child with HIV can receive MMR vaccine because the viruses in this vaccine are not transmitted from person to person.

Consensus recommendations and discussion

Starting immunoglobulin replacement therapy

Recommendation 1:

Patients with the following confirmed diagnoses should be given immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT):

- Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) according to current ESID* criteria, with recurrent infections.
- CVID according to current ESID criteria, without recurrent infections but with significant autoimmunity or inflammatory disease (eg GLILD †).
- XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinaemia)/autosomal recessive agammaglobulinaemia (ARA).
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID.
- Hyper IgM syndromes.
- Good's syndrome with low IgG level and recurrent infections. *European Society for Immunodeficiencies. †Granulomatous Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease.

Recommendation 2

Patients with other immunodeficiencies should not be routinely started on IgRT unless IgG levels are low or there is evidence of impaired humoral response. These cases should be discussed in an Immunology multidisciplinary team meeting before a decision to start IgRT is made.

Although there is broad consensus on the above statements it is imperative to emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach taking into account clinical information and alternative treatment options, regardless of diagnosis and absolute numerical results, in the decision to start IgRT. Improved access to genetic diagnosis should also facilitate decision making. Several comments from the respondents to the Delphi survey highlighted that some individuals with well-defined immunodeficiency, such as Good's syndrome and CVID, may remain well without immunoglobulin replacement. It was also highlighted by respondents that in some other immunodeficiencies, not listed above, IgRT may be of benefit; however, no comparative evidence was identified in the literature searches. A retrospective analysis of 32 patients with hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) and recurrent pulmonary infections did however conclude that in patients with HIES suffering from recurrent pulmonary infections a combination of prophylaxis with oral antibiotics and IgRT reduced the incidence of bacterial pneumonia.

Recommendation 3

If IgG is ≥ 4 g/L with preserved vaccine responses and a low infection burden, IgRT is not routinely indicated.

Recommendation 4

If IgG is ≥ 4 g/L and vaccine responses are poor (this will include patients with normal total immunoglobulin levels diagnosed as SPAD*), IgRT should not be routinely started unless the patient has recurrent and/or significant infection (see definition above) despite prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months and optimised medical management (e.g. including chest clearance) and/or radiologically confirmed bronchiectasis.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^113JRRbU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Despite this recommendation, mumps outbreaks continued to be reported throughout the United States, particularly in settings where persons have close, prolonged contact (e.g. universities and close-knit communities). To assist state and local health departments in responding to mumps outbreaks, CDC issued guidance on use of a third dose of MMR vaccine in the 2012 Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases. † The guidance was based on limited data and provided criteria for health departments regarding when to consider use of a third dose in specifically identified target populations. Additional evidence on effectiveness and safety of the third dose of MMR vaccine recently became available and was presented to ACIP during 2017. This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP regarding use of a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine during outbreaks and provides the recommendation for its use among persons who are at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak.

The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

### Presence of low mumps-specific IgG in oral fluids is associated with high mumps viral loads [^115tCPcE]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mumps outbreaks continue to occur in highly vaccinated populations. Although the diagnosis of mumps is primarily based on clinical symptoms, other viral infections such as parainfluenza can manifest in a similar manner. Therefore, laboratory confirmation of mumps virus infection is important.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to examine mumps cases during the January 2018 to March 2019 period in Ireland as well as to evaluate the association between mumps RNA viral loads, mumps IgG levels, age and gender among patients with laboratory-confirmed mumps virus infection.

Study Design

Oral fluid samples requested for mumps RNA testing (n = 1296) were included in the study. The mumps N gene was detected by real time PCR and reported as Ct values.

Results

The proportion of samples received monthly with detectable mumps RNA increased from 10.26%-70.3% during the recent outbreak. Acute mumps cases occurred predominantly in the 16–25 years old age cohort (67.5%) and in males (55.9%). Mumps RNA viral loads were significantly higher in females (p < 0.001). During the outbreak, a significantly higher proportion of samples had Ct < 30 (p < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between mumps IgG levels and Ct values in oral fluid samples (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The presence of low mumps virus-specific IgG in oral fluids is significantly associated with high mumps viral loads. Our findings show that mumps virus is maintained in circulation in the non-outbreak period and acute mumps cases occur predominantly in the MMR vaccinated young adult male population.

On May 17, 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated criteria for mumps immunity and mumps vaccination recommendations. According to the 1998 ACIP recommendations for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, for routine vaccination, a first dose of MMR vaccine is recommended at ages 12–15 months and a second dose at ages 4–6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine also are recommended for students attending colleges and other post-high school institutions. However, documentation of mumps immunity through vaccination has consisted of only 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine for all designated groups, including health-care workers.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^11425G29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The survey of health departments was distributed through the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to 81 health department jurisdictions, including 58 (72%) state and territorial health departments and 23 (28%) city or large urban health departments. Among the 61 (75%) responding health departments, 46 (75%) reported having one or more mumps outbreaks in their jurisdiction since January 1, 2016. Nearly half (47%, 20 of 43) of health departments that reported outbreaks indicated recommending an outbreak dose or third dose of MMR vaccine ** during one or more of these outbreaks. Compared with other mumps outbreak control measures, on a scale from not effective (0), to somewhat effective (5), to most effective (10), 42% (8 of 19) of health departments rated the intervention with an effectiveness score > 5 (more than somewhat effective) (median = 5, IQR = 3–7). On a scale from least cost beneficial (0), to somewhat cost beneficial (5), to most cost beneficial (10), 53% (8 of 15) of health departments rated the intervention with a cost benefit score > 5 (more than somewhat cost beneficial) (median = 7, IQR = 4–7).

GRADE Quality of Evidence Summary. The GRADE evidence type †† for critical outcomes was determined to be 4 for benefits (effectiveness for prevention of mumps) and 2 for harms (serious adverse events).

Methods

During March–October 2017, the ACIP Mumps Work Group held biweekly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence. Topics addressed included the epidemiology of mumps in the United States since introduction of a routine second dose of MMR vaccine; effectiveness, duration of protection, immunogenicity, and risk factors for 2-dose vaccine failure; and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of a third dose of MMR vaccine. Also assessed were stakeholders' values attributed to the perceived benefits and harms of a third dose of MMR vaccine, acceptability, and implementation considerations regarding use of a third dose of MMR vaccine. Where scientific data were lacking, the summary of evidence incorporated the opinions of the Mumps Work Group member experts. Quality of evidence related to the benefits and harms of a third dose of mumps virus–containing vaccine was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Methods and GRADE tables for the evidence for third dose of mumps virus–containing vaccine can be found at.

Summaries of the evidence reviewed were presented to ACIP at the February 2017, June 2017, and October 2017 meetings. At the October 2017 ACIP meeting, the proposed recommendation for a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine (i.e. MMR or measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [MMRV]) during mumps outbreaks was presented, and after a period for public comment, was approved unanimously by the voting ACIP members. §

Despite the established safety and efficacy of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after almost 50 years of widespread use, the United States is encountering higher levels of measles and mumps disease than has occurred for years. Return of disease threatens the health of those who remain unimmunized by choice as well as those who are immunized appropriately but experience loss of vaccine-induced immunity. The solution to continued threats of illness caused by these untreatable but readily preventable diseases is compliance with recommendations for administration of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Here we examine trends in the epidemiology of measles, mumps, and rubella in recent years and consider the consequences of loss of protective immunity within our country.

Implementation Considerations and Future Research

In the setting of an identified mumps outbreak, public health authorities should define target groups at increased risk for mumps during the outbreak, determine whether vaccination of at-risk persons is indicated, and provide recommendations for vaccination to health care providers. Persons at increased risk for acquiring mumps are those who are more likely to have prolonged or intense exposure to droplets or saliva from a person infected with mumps, such as through close contact or sharing of drinks or utensils. During an outbreak, persons identified as being at increased risk and who have received ≤ 2 doses of mumps virus–containing vaccine or have unknown vaccination status should receive 1 dose. Additional guidance can be found in the Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.

Contraindications and precautions for administration of a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine are the same as those for routine use of the vaccine (1 or 2 doses). CDC will monitor the burden of mumps among persons who have received 2 and 3 doses of mumps virus–containing vaccine and the duration of protection conferred by the third dose, as well as adverse events after the receipt of a third dose of a mumps virus–containing vaccine. Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS;). In addition, CDC will continue to collect data to assess the impact of receipt of a third dose of mumps virus–containing vaccine on mumps outbreaks.

### Measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (PRIORIX): recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^1115H1pv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

ITP is associated with the receipt of live attenuated measles vaccines. In the four randomized controlled clinical trials at the U.S. potency of PRIORIX, one case of ITP was identified among 1,960 PRIORIX recipients and one case among 933 M-M-R II recipients. From a previous postmarketing study conducted in the United States, the rate of ITP after M-M-R II is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 doses. However, strain- or vaccine formulation–specific data on ITP risk are sparse. Based on the clinical trials and the literature, the rates of ITP after vaccination were considered similar for PRIORIX and M-M-R II.

Short-term humoral immunity was assessed using data from 13 randomized controlled trials (.), four at the licensed U.S. potency of PRIORIX, and nine at a lower potency of PRIORIX used in other countries. Serologic response thresholds were achieved for all three antigens in all studies. Antibodies in all studies were more than 8.8-fold higher than the predefined seroresponse threshold for measles (200 mIU per mL; correlate of protection 120 mIU per mL) and more than 4.2-fold higher than the rubella correlate (10 IU per mL). Although an antibody correlate of protection has not been established for mumps, the anti-mumps antibody level was ≥ 3.3-fold higher than the mumps seroconversion threshold (10 IU per mL). The four studies conducted with PRIORIX at the U.S. potency found no significant difference in anti-measles, anti-mumps, or anti-rubella geometric mean concentrations (GMC) after the first dose between PRIORIX and M-M-R II recipients. Among the nine studies at a lower PRIORIX potency, eight showed no statistically significant difference between anti-measles or anti-rubella GMC levels, and seven showed no statistically significant difference between anti-mumps GMC levels. One study reported on persistence of the humoral immune response (2 years after vaccination) and found no difference between vaccines. None of the four studies that reported on GMC after a second dose noted a significant difference for any antigen at any potency after a second dose between PRIORIX or M-M-R II recipients.

Other considerations — vaccination in children and adolescents with HIV are as follows: For hepatitis A vaccine (HepA), "Postvaccination serology is recommended for patients with HIV following HepA, and, if lower than 10 mIU/mL, revaccination with a series of HepA can be considered". For hepatitis B vaccine, "postvaccination serology is recommended for people with certain risk factors, including HIV, and revaccination is recommended if levels are lower than 10 mIU/mL". Regarding measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), "Currently, the only vaccine for which there is a recommendation for revaccination is MMR, for which ACIP made specific recommendations for routine revaccination after initiation of ART", and individuals with perinatally acquired HIV vaccinated before effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) "should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine after effective ART has been established". For household contacts, "All members of a household who are aged > 6 months can receive yearly influenza vaccines", and contacts "can receive the LAIV or the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); there is no preference between LAIV and IIV"; for varicella, "Immunization against varicella is encouraged" for contacts without evidence of immunity, transmission of vaccine virus "is rare", and if smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) is needed, contact with the child or adolescent "should be avoided". For human papillomavirus (HPV), although immunocompetent initiators "between 9 and 14 years of age" may use a two-dose schedule "(0, > 6 months)", "a three-dose schedule (0, 1 to 2 months, > 6 months) is recommended for all children and adolescents who are immunocompromised, including those with HIV".

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^115CSBvH]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunity and post-exposure management — health care workers should have documented immunity to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), with adequate proof of immunity consisting of documented vaccination (2 doses MMR, > 28 days apart with first dose after 1st birthday), laboratory documentation of protective titers, laboratory documentation of disease, or birth before 1957. In the setting of a measles, mumps or rubella outbreak, vaccination with two doses of MMR also is recommended for those born before 1957 who do not otherwise have evidence of immunity. MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy and specific instructions should be provided regarding avoidance of conception for at least 3 months, and because it is a live virus vaccine, MMR should not be administered to individuals with severe immunosuppression. If inadvertent exposure occurs to an infected patient, non-immune health care workers should be furloughed from day 5 following first exposure until day 21 following last exposure for measles, from day 12 following first exposure until day 25 following last exposure for mumps, and from day 7 following first exposure until day 23 following last exposure for rubella (or seven days following onset of rash if the health care worker develops rubella).

### Age-specific seroprevalence of measles, mumps, and rubella IgG across all age groups in chonburi province, Thailand after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic [^115Pp1Kn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Thailand's Expanded Program on Immunization revised the timing of the second measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine dose to 2.5 years in 2014 and later to 1.5 years in 2020. These adjustments can temporarily reduce vaccine coverage as the population transitions to the new schedules. Combined with disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, these changes may have adversely affected vaccine uptake and overall population immunity. This study aimed to evaluate the age-specific seroprevalence of anti-measles, anti-mumps, and anti-rubella IgG in individuals across all age groups in Chonburi province, Thailand, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Between October 2022 and January 2023, 650 participants from Chonburi were included and categorized into nine age groups: < 5, 5–10, 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, 61–70, and > 70 years. The levels of antibodies were analyzed using commercial ELISA kits. Overall, 77.5%, 55.1%, and 84.1% were seropositive for MMR antibodies, respectively. Adolescents aged 11–20 years had the lowest seropositivity rates for measles (47.0%) and mumps (27.6%), followed by young adults aged 21–30 years. Rubella seropositivity rates were similarly low in these groups. This study highlights immunity gaps for measles in adolescents and young adults. To address this gap and support ongoing measles elimination efforts, targeted interventions, such as supplementary immunization activities with a booster dose of measles-containing vaccines for this age group, are recommended to prevent the potential resurgence of measles in the near future.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^115pEsE4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Solid organ transplantation (SOT) secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — evaluation and IgG replacement: Post-SOT SHG is associated with increased infections and mortality, particularly in LT, HT, and KT recipients. Published expert opinion has recommended screening of humoral immunity before SOT to identify the underlying PID and patients with lower baseline IgG levels at risk, and has recommended monitoring for decreasing IgG levels, loss of specific antibody titers, and recurrent and/or severe bacterial infections every 6 to 12 months after SOT. Published expert opinions have proposed that evaluations include serum IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, IgM, and specific antibody titers to tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and completing recommended vaccinations before SOT is an important piece of infection prophylaxis. The decision to initiate immunoglobulin G replacement therapy (IgG-RT) in SHG post-SOT should be made by a clinical immunologist, and based on the PI literature, IgG-RT could be considered even in the absence of infections if IgG levels are persistently below 350 mg/dL with documented lack of antibody response; patients are typically already on antibiotic and other antifungal/antiviral prophylaxis at time of SHG detection.

### Mumps resurgence in the United States [^116JjEKD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The recent mumps epidemic in the central United States has generated a large amount of public concern. A total of 2597 mumps cases have been reported in the United States in 11 states since January 1, 2006, representing a marked resurgence of mumps in a single year. The majority of these recent cases have occurred in college students age 18 to 25 years. Most were vaccinated with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella-containing vaccines. Such outbreaks provide an opportunity for clinicians to review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and morbidity of vaccine-preventable infections and also to review immunologic mechanisms and practice guidelines that might contribute to poor vaccine responses. A review of mumps is provided with discussion of potential mechanisms for vaccine failure.

### Iatrogenic antibody deficiency from B-cell targeted therapies in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^114XVZ61]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our group has recently published recommendations for management of secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia due to BCTT in AIRD. Clinical evaluation should take into account the degree of hypogammaglobulinaemia, infection history, assessment of antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens and whether a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate. Measurement of antibody responses 4–8 weeks after administration of the non-conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is typically used in the assessment of hypogammaglobulinaemia to identify functional/specific antibody deficiency. The UKguidelines recommend initiating IGRT in patients with secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia of any cause (IgG < 5 g/L), functional antibody deficiency and failure of antibiotic prophylaxis over 3 months in preventing infections. These guidelines are currently in the process of revision. Although there is no supportive evidence available, we would suggest that in some settings, for example, a history of severe/life-threatening infections with very low IgG levels (< 1–2 g/L) together with absent/very impaired (postvaccination) specific antibody responses, it may be appropriate to consider IGRT without a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency Guideline for Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous Administration advised IGRT in secondary immunodeficiency with severe or recurrent infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either serum IgG level of < 4 g/L or proven specific antibody failure. An IgG value of 4 g/L is also noted as a level for consideration of IGRT in other reviews of secondary antibody deficiency. In hypogammaglobulinaemia related to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the majority of infections occurred when IgG was below 3 g/L. Canadian guidelines from 2018 refer to IgG below the lower limit of the reference range on two occasions.

### Seronegative vaccinees may not benefit from multiple booster doses of MMR vaccine in restoring immunity [^116nXGef]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the decline of immune response over time has also been recorded for mumps in vaccinated young adults. This has been mainly attributed to antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and the infecting strain. Additionally, lower memory B cell frequency and waning antibody levels contribute to reduced immunity. Thus, enhancing the MMR vaccine formulation to elicit a stronger and more durable protection against measles and mumps, may offer a more sustainable strategy for controlling and eliminating these diseases. Therefore, continued research and innovation in vaccine development are crucial to address evolving challenges in infectious disease prevention and control. A mucosal vaccine would likely contribute to strengthening immunity against measles and provide a chance to induce long‐lasting immunity.

Further research is needed to elucidate vaccine failure mechanisms, optimize booster strategies, and identify novel correlates of protection to prevent measles resurgence in response to the growing threats of infectious diseases.

Interchangeability

PRIORIX and M-M-R II are fully interchangeable. ACIP General Best Practices states a preference that doses of vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer; however, vaccination should not be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously administered vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from the same manufacturer is unavailable. Studies have shown that PRIORIX is safe and immunogenic when administered as a second dose after M-M-R II.

### Varicella-zoster-virus vaccination in immunosuppressed children with rheumatic diseases using a pre-vaccination check list [^115cqZvY]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In countries with targeted immunization strategies the pre-vaccination checklist may be even more helpful protecting susceptible patients with urgent need for IS and high risk of chickenpox exposure. In patients without a 2-dose VZV vaccination and uncertain history of VZV disease, testing for VZV-IgG seems advisable prior to long-term IS, and negative or borderline VZV-IgG levels should lead to vaccination. On the other hand, post-exposure prophylaxis with acyclovir and VZV hyperimmune globulin may fail in preventing varicella disease during IS. Furthermore, reactivation and HZ often cause substantial morbidity during IS and occur much more often from latent wild-virus infection than after reactivation of the latent VZV vaccine strain.

One limitation of our study is that this is a rather small cohort of patients treated with various combinations of IS. We only documented an increase in VZV-IgG but CMI may be just as important. Long-term data for VZV-IgG and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in patients with leukemia or immunosuppression (IS) who received two doses of the VZV vaccine showed that VZV-IgG peaks and then declines over time, whereas long-lasting VZV-CMI persists and protects between 75–100% of vaccinees from clinically relevant VZV disease after exposure. Furthermore, post-vaccination titers are less in magnitude when compared to that following wild type VZV infection. In a cohort of 20 patients receiving HIIS at our center, including rituximab, all patients with a history of chickenpox maintained very high seroconversion levels of VZV-IgG (range 1052 to greater than 2000 mIU/ml) (unpublished data).

It is noteworthy that none of the screened patients "failed" the stratification process. Based on further experience and data the pre-vaccination checklist may be simplified in the future, especially concerning booster-live vaccinations. Moreover, the application of the pre-vaccination checklist for first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination on LIIS and booster MMR vaccination on LIIS and HIIS should be discussed. Two minor modifications have been proposed by experts regarding the application of the MMR vaccine: first, proof of an increase in antibody titer following "diagnostic immunization" with inactivated vaccines and, second, a higher threshold for CD4 + T cells (> 500/μl).

Vaccination timing prior to immunosuppression and household contacts in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) — Immunization is conditionally recommended for children with active non-systemic JIA who have not yet been immunized for measles, mumps, rubella, and/or varicella prior to starting immunosuppressive medications, but this recommendation excludes active, untreated systemic JIA in which delaying treatment initiation for vaccinations may be prohibitive; as per the CDC, immunosuppressive therapy should not be initiated until 4 weeks after administration of a live vaccine and ideally 2 weeks after administration of an inactivated vaccine, and if withholding/delaying medication initiation is not feasible, live-attenuated vaccine immunization should be deferred and given at a later time when disease is in remission and the child is no longer being treated; additionally, vaccines are strongly recommended for household contacts of children with JIA who are receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and household contacts and other close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence should receive all age- and exposure-appropriate vaccines, whether inactivated or live, with the exception of smallpox vaccine.

Corticosteroid-associated SHG — frequency and clinical impact — shows that SHG has been described in 12% to 58% of adult patients on chronic or high-dose corticosteroid therapy; short courses of oral corticosteroids have been associated with a transient drop in serum IgG lasting several weeks beyond cessation, whereas long-term oral corticosteroid therapy has been associated with more significantly decreased IgG levels; high-dose inhaled corticosteroids have not had a demonstrable effect on serum IgG levels; IgA and IgM levels are less affected than IgG by corticosteroids; and unlike other SHG types, corticosteroid-associated SHG does not appear to be associated with increased frequency or severity of infectious complications.

### Hypogammaglobulinemia in neonates: illustrative cases and review of the literature [^116NN3xQ]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

This article presents a review of causes of hypogammaglobulinemia in neonates utilizing illustrative cases to demonstrate commonly seen conditions. Overall, the causes of low immunoglobulin level can be divided into three main categories: decreased maternal transfer or production (due to physiological nadir, transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, medication effects, or immunodeficiency), increased loss of immunoglobulins (from the gastrointestinal (GI) system, lymphatics, kidneys, skin disease, or blood loss) or destruction/suppression (from medication effects). Treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia is generally tailored to the underlying cause and condition of the patient. This can be through supportive care, prophylactic measures, or with immunoglobulin G (IgG) replacement at the recommendation of an immunologist.

CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy — secondary hypogammaglobulinemia evaluation and management are guided by expert opinion. Published expert opinion has recommended screening quantitative immunoglobulins and specific antibody titers in response to vaccines before and 3 months after initiation of CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy to risk stratify the need for prophylactic IgG-RT. Management proposals include prophylactic IgG-RT for IgG levels less than 400 mg/dL during the first 3 months after initiation of CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy, with consideration of IgG-RT after the first 3 months for patients with IgG levels less than or equal to 400 mg/dL and serious, persistent, or recurrent bacterial infections. A position paper from Spain has proposed an IgG trough level above 400 mg/dL and IgG-RT in all pediatric patients approximately 1 month after initiation of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, with consideration of increasing the dose if infections persist; vaccination strategies are modeled after HSCT vaccination schedules. This preliminary guidance was made in the absence of specific data regarding the efficacy of prophylactic IgG-RT after CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy, is based on PI, SOT, HSCT, and B cell malignancy literature, and IgG level cutoffs need interpretation alongside other indicators of immune function.

ITP in children — diagnosis, Helicobacter pylori testing, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine management are addressed with graded directives. We recommend that bone marrow examination is unnecessary in children and adolescents with the typical features of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and is not necessary in children who fail IVIG therapy (both grade 1B). We suggest that bone marrow examination is also not necessary in similar patients prior to initiation of treatment with corticosteroids or before splenectomy (grade 2C) and that testing for antinuclear antibodies is not necessary in the evaluation of children and adolescents with suspected ITP (grade 2C). For H pylori, we recommend against routine testing for H pylori in children with chronic ITP (grade 1B). For MMR-associated ITP, we recommend that children with a history of ITP who are unimmunized receive their scheduled first MMR vaccine (grade 1B), and in those who have already received a first dose, vaccine titers can be checked; if full immunity is present (90% to 95% of children), no further MMR should be given, whereas if immunity is inadequate, reimmunization with MMR at the recommended age is advised (grade 1B).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111SKrEh]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — people with HIV should follow age-based dosing and immunosuppression criteria: Absence of severe immunosuppression is defined as CD4 percentages ≥ 15% for ≥ 6 months for people aged ≤ 5 years and CD4 percentages ≥ 15% and CD4 count ≥ 200 lymphocytes/mm3 for ≥ 6 months for people aged > 5 years; when CD4 percentages are not available for those aged ≤ 5 years, absence is defined as ≥ 6 months above age-specific CD4 count criteria (CD4 count > 750 lymphocytes/mm3 while aged ≤ 12 months and CD4 count ≥ 500 lymphocytes/mm3 while aged 1 through 5 years). The first dose should be administered at age 12 months through 15 months, and the second dose should be administered at age 4 years through 6 years (or as early as 28 days after the first dose). Individuals with perinatally acquired HIV who were vaccinated prior to the establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) should receive two appropriately spaced doses (28 days between each dose) of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established and there is no evidence of current severe immunosuppression, as defined by ACIP, and MMR vaccine is recommended for international travelers aged 6 months through 11 months. The MMR and MMRV vaccines are contraindicated in people with AIDS or HIV who have severe immunosuppression with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 or a CD4 percentage < 15%, and MMRV vaccine has not been studied in people with HIV and should not be substituted for MMR vaccine in people with HIV, regardless of CD4 count; when only CD4 counts or percentages are available for those aged > 5 years, assessment can be based on the available CD4 value.

### Measles virus neutralizing antibody response, cell-mediated immunity, and immunoglobulin G antibody avidity before and after receipt of a third dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in young adults [^1164aG5s]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are 97% effective against measles, but waning antibody immunity to measles and failure of the 2-dose vaccine occur. We administered a third MMR dose (MMR3) to young adults and assessed immunogenicity over 1 year.

Methods

Measles virus (MeV) neutralizing antibody concentrations, cell-mediated immunity (CMI), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody avidity were assessed at baseline and 1 month and 1 year after MMR3 receipt.

Results

Of 662 subjects at baseline, 1 (0.2%) was seronegative for MeV-neutralizing antibodies (level, < 8 mIU/mL), and 23 (3.5%) had low antibody levels (8–120 mIU/mL). One month after MMR3 receipt, 1 subject (0.2%) was seronegative, and 6 (0.9%) had low neutralizing antibodies, with only 21 of 662 (3.2%) showing a ≥ 4-fold rise in neutralizing antibodies. One year after MMR3 receipt, no subject was seronegative, and 10 of 617 (1.6%) had low neutralizing antibody levels. CMI analyses showed low levels of spot-forming cells after stimulation, suggesting the presence of T-cell memory, but the response was minimal after MMR3 receipt. MeV IgG avidity did not correlate with findings of neutralization analyses.

Conclusions

Most subjects were seropositive before MMR3 receipt, and very few had a secondary immune response after MMR3 receipt. Similarly, CMI and avidity analyses showed minimal qualitative improvements in immune response after MMR3 receipt. We did not find compelling data to support a routine third dose of MMR vaccine.

### Recommendation of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak [^113Tf6WT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Summary of Rationale for Recommendation for a Third Dose of Mumps Virus–Containing Vaccine in Persons at Increased Risk for Acquiring Mumps During an Outbreak

Mumps outbreaks have occurred primarily in populations in institutional settings with close contact or in close-knit communities. The current routine recommendation for 2 doses of MMR vaccine appears to be sufficient for mumps control in the general population, but insufficient for preventing mumps outbreaks in prolonged, close-contact settings, even where coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine is high. Waning of vaccine-induced immunity with time after receipt of the second vaccine dose in high intensity exposure settings typical of outbreaks contributes to this higher risk for mumps disease in these settings. Protection against severe disease, however, is maintained. Considering the evidence regarding the public health burden of disease and the known risk factors, persons who are at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak were identified as a public health priority for receiving a third dose of mumps virus–containing vaccine.

A third dose of MMR vaccine has at least a short-term benefit for persons in outbreak settings. No serious adverse events were reported, and rates of nonserious adverse events were low. Because mumps is prevented in persons who receive a third dose, complications will also be prevented. Together, the benefit of added protection through administration of a third dose of MMR vaccine outweighs the low risk for vaccine-associated adverse events. Universities and health departments value the prevention of mumps disease and mumps complications and recognize that there is a potential loss of productivity because of mumps disease. A third dose of MMR vaccine was considered acceptable to students, parents, universities/schools, and health departments. Regarding implementation, an ACIP recommendation would allow health departments to make more rapid decisions regarding use of a third dose of MMR vaccine and increase access to vaccine for persons identified by public health authorities as being at increased risk for mumps because of an outbreak. MMRV vaccine, which is the other vaccine licensed in the United States for the prevention of mumps, §§ may also be used when a third dose mumps vaccination is indicated among children aged ≤ 12 years.

Patient C

On November 2, 2015, a man aged 21 years developed left facial pain and swelling and tested positive for mumps by PCR on a buccal swab specimen. Twenty-two days after onset of symptoms, he was treated at an emergency department for neck stiffness, fever, and tachycardia. A lumbar puncture was performed, and he was empirically treated for meningitis with acyclovir and ceftriaxone. Volume of cerebrospinal fluid was inadequate for performing PCR testing for mumps, but Gram stain and bacterial culture were negative, and analysis was consistent with viral meningitis (40 lymphocytes/mm 3, 60 mg/dL of protein, and 67 mg/dL of glucose). Because the onset of mumps-related meningitis has been described as ranging from 4 days before the onset of parotitis until 3 weeks after, the patient's viral meningitis diagnosis was attributed to mumps. He was discharged with recommendations for symptomatic care, and meningeal symptoms resolved within 1 week.

Complications of mumps have been reported less frequently since licensure and widespread use of mumps-containing vaccines. However, this case series demonstrates that complications still occur, even in persons who have received the recommended 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. In addition, complications can occur at varying times throughout the course of the illness and in the absence of parotitis. Health officials should remain vigilant for these complications and their relation to mumps, and when mumps is suspected, conduct PCR testing on a buccal swab specimen and serology on a serum specimen.

### How to use immunoglobulin levels in investigating immune deficiencies [^1141pRkh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Children are often referred to immunologists for the evaluation of reduced serum immunoglobulins. Knowledge of the immunoglobulin levels in healthy children of different ages is necessary when estimating immunological deficiency states of various kinds. After the measurement of the serum levels of the three major isotypes, examination of the capacity of the child to form antibodies to several antigens is a reasonable next step in the evaluation. We can rely on vaccine responses to make the distinction between significant primary immunodeficiency diseases and transiently low immunoglobulin levels. On the other hand, normal values of IgM, IgG and IgA are not always enough to exclude a more serious condition. Regardless of immunoglobulin concentrations, if a child's history indicates that further evaluation is warranted, a complete humoral immunity study should be carried out, including IgG subclasses, specific antibody responses and identification of B lymphocyte populations.

### Inebilizumab (Uplizna) [^11711Szp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccinations

Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of UPLIZNA. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines following UPLIZNA therapy has not been studied, and vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell repletion.

Vaccination of Infants Born to Mothers Treated with UPLIZNA During Pregnancy

In infants of mothers exposed to UPLIZNA during pregnancy, do not administer live or live-attenuated vaccines before confirming recovery of B-cell counts in the infant. Depletion of B-cells in these exposed infants may increase the risks from live or live-attenuated vaccines. Non-live vaccines, as indicated, may be administered prior to recovery from B-cell and immunoglobulin level depletion, but consultation with a qualified specialist should be considered to assess whether a protective immune response was mounted [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.3	Reduction in Immunoglobulins

There may be a progressive and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia or decline in the levels of total and individual immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) with continued UPLIZNA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the levels of quantitative serum immunoglobulins during treatment with UPLIZNA, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, and until B-cell repletion after discontinuation of therapy. Consider discontinuing UPLIZNA therapy if a patient with low immunoglobulin G or M develops a serious opportunistic infection or recurrent infections, or if prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia requires treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins.

5.4	Fetal Risk

Based on animal data, UPLIZNA can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphopenia and reduce antibody response in offspring exposed to UPLIZNA even after B-cell repletion. Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to mothers exposed to other B-cell depleting antibodies during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving UPLIZNA and for at least 6 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Calculated globulin (CG) as a screening test for antibody deficiency [^112LCT65]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are no published studies of the utility of CG to screen for antibody deficiency, and the principal findings of the current study are that using appropriately established method-dependent CG cut-off values it is possible to detect primary and secondary antibody deficiencies, as well as small new paraproteins associated with immune-paresis. This approach fulfils the criteria of a screening test, and as a proof-of-principle, patients detected with low CG have been diagnosed with CVID and commenced on immunoglobulin replacement. Using the BCG methodology for albumin measurement and the Biuret method for total protein, a cut-off value of < 18 g/l for calculated globulin defines a population in which 89% have an IgG level of < 6 g/l.

A limitation of this study is that it did not evaluate the utility of CG in children, as the normal ranges for immunoglobulins vary with age; however, levels approximating the adult ranges are achieved by the age of 9–10 years and potentially further studies could address whether screening using CG could be used from 10 years of age. Clinically, children below this age have a higher frequency of infection which declines with age.

There are several approaches to the introduction of electronic comments to aid clinicians. The most straightforward would be on samples from primary care, as the use of intravenous fluids (which may temporarily perturb CG levels) in this setting would be unlikely, and the patients in the case histories all reported frequent contact with their GP. Several comments were developed for a low CG in primary care and the GP laboratory management committee liaison group selected the following comment on the basis that it interprets the underlying abnormality and suggests action which may be considered in the appropriate clinical setting: 'Low calculated globulin may represent antibody deficiency. Consider immunoglobulin measurement if there is a history of infections'.

In secondary care a similar comment could be used, with an added caveat that intravenous fluid administration in surgical, medical or intensive care may cause a temporarily low CG.

IDSA COVID-19 serology in high-suspicion symptomatic patients with negative NAATs — Recommendation 2 states that the IDSA panel recommends against using IgG antibodies to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative NAATs (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Supporting evidence identified 19 studies in such patients; PCR-negative/IgG-positive results ranged from 0% to 93%, with most studies reporting this combination in fewer than 50% of samples, and PCR-negative/IgM-positive results ranged from 2% to 83%. The guideline remarks that contemporary populations are more likely to have prior infection or vaccination than the study populations, which could negatively affect pooled specificity calculations.

### Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^112oDf7Q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This report is a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps. The report presents the recent revisions adopted by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on October 24, 2012, and also summarizes all existing ACIP recommendations that have been published previously during 1998–2011 (CDC. Measles, mumps, and rubella — vaccine use and strategies for elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome and control of mumps: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-8]; CDC. Revised ACIP recommendation for avoiding pregnancy after receiving a rubellacontaining vaccine. MMWR 2001;50:1117; CDC. Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] for the control and elimination of mumps. MMWR 2006;55:629–30; and, CDC. Immunization of healthcare personnel: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2011;60[No. RR-7]). Currently, ACIP recommends 2 doses of MMR vaccine routinely for children with the first dose administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. Two doses are recommended for adults at high risk for exposure and transmission (e.g., students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers) and 1 dose for other adults aged ≥ 18 years. For prevention of rubella, 1 dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 months. At the October 24, 2012 meeting, ACIP adopted the following revisions, which are published here for the first time. These included:

- For acceptable evidence of immunity, removing documentation of physician diagnosed disease as an acceptable criterion for evidence of immunity for measles and mumps, and including laboratory confirmation of disease as a criterion for acceptable evidence of immunity for measles, rubella, and mumps.
- For persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, expanding recommendations for vaccination to all persons aged ≥ 12 months with HIV infection who do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression; recommending revaccination of persons with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated before establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) with 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established; and changing the recommended timing of the 2 doses of MMR vaccine for HIV-infected persons to age 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years.
- For measles postexposure prophylaxis, expanding recommendations for use of immune globulin administered intramuscularly (IGIM) to include infants aged birth to 6 months exposed to measles; increasing the recommended dose of IGIM for immunocompetent persons; and recommending use of immune globulin administered intravenously (IGIV) for severely immunocompromised persons and pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who are exposed to measles. As a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps, the information in this report is intended for use by clinicians as baseline guidance for scheduling of vaccinations for these conditions and considerations regarding vaccination of special populations. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information becomes available.

### Serology to diagnose mumps… [^115HQCfy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaccination status and timing of specimen collection can affect the ability to detect IgM in persons infected with mumps.
- In general, IgM detection is highest in unvaccinated persons, intermediate in one-dose vaccine recipients, and lowest in two-dose vaccine recipients.
- Specimens collected more than 3 days post-parotitis onset are more likely to have a positive IgM result than those collected earlier. Recommended serologic assays Both EIA and IFA assays can perform well for diagnosis of primary mumps infection. Acute-phase mumps specimens may contain significant levels of mumps IgG, especially among persons with a history of 1 or 2 doses of MMR. The IFA format is particularly susceptible to interference by high levels of mumps IgG. Treatment of serum with an agent to remove human IgG antibody, such as Gullsorb ™ or a similar IgG inactivation reagent, is necessary to avoid false-positive IgM test results.

Testing results Negative IgM & positive IgG result Absence of a mumps IgM response in a vaccinated or previously infected individual presenting with clinically compatible mumps does not rule out mumps as a diagnosis. A positive IgG result is expected among previously vaccinated persons. Older persons or foreign-born persons with no history of mumps illness or vaccination may have detectable mumps IgG due to a previous subclinical infection. Positive IgM result Mumps diagnosis is supported by detecting mumps IgM antibody in serum specimen collected as soon as possible after symptom onset. A positive IgM test result indicates current or very recent infection or reinfection. A positive IgM test result may also be observed following mumps vaccination. Positive IgG result A single serum sample tested for mumps-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosing acute mumps infections.

The presence of mumps-specific IgG, as detected using a serologic assay, does not necessarily predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies or protection from mumps disease. Limitations of serologic tests The presence of mumps-specific IgG indicates a recent or a prior exposure to mumps virus or mumps vaccine. Serologic tests cannot differentiate between an exposure to vaccine and an exposure to wild-type mumps virus.

### Laboratory testing for mumps… [^1179hgPA]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Serology testing: IgM can aid in diagnosis but is not confirmatory. The availability of assays to detect IgM and to measure IgG antibodies varies among laboratories. Your state health department can provide guidance regarding available laboratory services in your state. At the direction of your state health department, providers and health departments may send serum specimens from suspected mumps cases to CDC for IgM detection. Use a capture IgM enzyme immunoassay that incorporates a recombinant mumps nucleocapsid protein as the antigen. Negative rRT-PCR or IgM result Failure to detect mumps virus RNA by rRT-PCR and/or a negative IgM result specimen from a person with clinically compatible mumps symptoms does not rule out mumps. This is because successful detection of mumps virus depends primarily on the timing of collection and quality of the clinical sample.

The following factors can affect mumps detection:

- Vaccinated individuals may shed virus for a shorter period and in smaller amounts, degrading the sample and hampering successful detection.
- Viral RNA may not be detectable in specimens that have been collected, stored or shipped improperly. IgM may be transient or absent and therefore not detected.
- In outbreaks among two-dose vaccine recipients, mumps virus RNA was detected in specimen from 30%–71% of case-patients ifthe specimen were collected within 3 days following onset of parotitis. IgM was detected in 13%–50% of these cases. Positive IgG result The presence of mumps-specific IgG, as detected using a serologic assay, does not necessarily predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies or protection from mumps disease.

### Mumps | Laboratory confirmation by IgM serology | Lab testing | CDC… [^114HbEno]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination status and timing of specimen collection can affect the ability to detect IgM in persons infected with mumps. In general, IgM detection is highest in unvaccinated persons, intermediate in one-dose vaccine recipients, and lowest in two-dose vaccine recipients. Specimens collected __ > __ 3 days post-parotitis onset are more likely to have a positive IgM result than those collected earlier. Failure to detect mumps IgM in previously vaccinated persons who are infected with mumps has been well documented. People with a history of mumps vaccination may not have detectable mumps IgM antibody regardless of timing of specimen collection. IgG test results are typically positive and elevated at the initial blood draw, making detection of a 4-fold rise or seroconversion unlikely and therefore not recommended. Q: What type of serologic assay is recommended for mumps IgM testing. A: Both EIA and IFA assays can perform well for diagnosis of primary mumps infection.

Acute-phase mumps specimens may contain significant levels of mumps IgG, especially among persons with a history of 1 or 2 doses of MMR. The IFA format is particularly susceptible to interference by high levels of mumps IgG. Treatment of serum with an agent to remove human IgG antibody, such as Gullsorb ™ or a similar IgG inactivation reagent, is necessary to avoid false-positive IgM test results. Q: What does a positive mumps IgG test result mean. A: A single serum sample tested for mumps-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosing acute mumps infections. The presence of mumps-specific IgG, as detected using a serologic assay, does not necessarily predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies or protection from mumps disease. See related questions regarding measurement of rise in IgG titer. Q: If the IgM result is negative and IgG is positive, can mumps be ruled out.

A: Absence of a mumps IgM response in a vaccinated or previously infected individual presenting with clinically compatible mumps as a diagnosis. A positive IgG result is expected among previously vaccinated persons. Older persons or foreign-born persons with no history of mumps illness or vaccination may have detectable mumps IgG due to a previous subclinical infection. does not rule out mumps. Q: Why is it difficult to demonstrate a rise in titer from persons with a history of vaccination.

### Strategies for the control and investigation of mumps outbreaks… [^117G9gto]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Mumps testing guidance summary Mumps cases can be confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or viral culture, usually in buccal swab specimens. rRT-PCR is the preferred method for laboratory confirmation of mumps. Immunoglobulin M testing of serum can be used to aid in diagnosis and to classify probable cases, but it is not confirmatory.
- If it has been > 3 days since parotitis onset, collect a buccal swab specimen for rRT-PCR and a serum specimen for IgM detection.
- If the patient has orchitis/oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, hearing loss, meningitis or encephalitis and does not have parotitis, collect a buccal swab specimen for rRT-PCR and a serum specimen for IgM detection regardless of the days since symptom onset. Additionally, a urine specimen can be collected for rRT-PCR if appropriate. Known close contacts Known close contacts should be assessed for presumptive evidence of immunity, and those without evidence of immunity should be brought up to date on MMR vaccination. Close contacts of mumps patient who do not have prior evidence of immunity should not be tested for laboratory evidence of immunity since a positive immunoglobulin G titer may indicate acute infection. Persons recommended to receive MMR should not be tested for laboratory evidence of immunity prior to receiving a dose since a positive IgG titer may indicate acute infection and does not indicate protection against mumps disease. No additional dose is recommended for people who had already received three or more doses before the outbreak.

Notify healthcare providers & institutions of the third-dose recommendation Public health officials should work with healthcare providers and institutions to notify people that they are at increased risk and should receive a third dose of MMR vaccine. Important messages to communicate include: Although there are no data that correlate levels of serum antibody with protection from disease, presence of mumps-specific IgG antibodies is considered evidence of either prior natural infection or vaccination and therefore is considered evidence of mumps immunity. For healthcare personnel who do not have presumptive evidence of mumps immunity, pre-vaccination antibody screening before MMR vaccination is not necessary.
