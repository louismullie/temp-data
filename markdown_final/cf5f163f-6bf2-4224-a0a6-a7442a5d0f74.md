## Question

What complications are associated with cryptorchidism in a 13-year-old?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what complications are associated with cryptorchidism in a 13-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major complication domains: malignancy risk, fertility impairment, torsion risk, and associated anatomic/endocrine issues. Then, I should verify how age 13 specifically amplifies each risk compared with early correction. Next, I will review immediate clinical priorities, including when to image versus when to operate, and guideline-based timing and surgical choices. After that, I will outline long-term surveillance for cancer and fertility, and I should double-check where guidelines differ from case reports about ultrasound screening. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic plan tailored to a 13-year-old and ensure counseling points are captured accurately [^116rkWMT] [^1178UWL2] [^115g4hPo] [^112zK71z].

> Let me first confirm the core complications with high-quality sources so I don't overstate anything: cryptorchidism confers a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of testicular germ cell cancer overall, and age at orchiopexy matters; orchiopexy before 13 years carries a relative risk around 2.23 vs the general population, while orchiopexy at 13 or older raises risk to about 5.40 in the NEJM Swedish cohort, indicating substantially higher risk when correction is delayed to adolescence; roughly 5% of testicular cancers are attributable to a history of cryptorchidism, which underscores population-level impact but not inevitability at the individual level [^1158yn2N] [^112bXHmK] [^111s4cYF] [^116rkWMT].

> I need to check fertility implications carefully, especially around puberty: histologic data show significant reductions in germ cell counts and markers in boys ≥ 9 years with acquired cryptorchidism, suggesting substantial spermatogenic compromise by early adolescence; adult outcome data indicate that men with previously acquired undescended testes have smaller testicular volume and lower sperm quality vs controls; long-term series suggest paternity near 90% after unilateral prepubertal repair but closer to 65% after bilateral repair, and if bilateral surgery is delayed until after puberty, fertility is described as "unlikely", though I should acknowledge this comes from lower-quality evidence and individual outcomes vary [^111JYGZb] [^1142uf5D] [^116HWKXZ] [^1178UWL2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acute risks — torsion in an undescended testis is uncommon but consequential: a recent series found 8.9% of pediatric torsion cases occurred in cryptorchid testes with only a 35% salvage rate, and torsion often presents with abdominal or inguinal pain rather than scrotal pain, so a high index of suspicion and timely exploration are critical; broader torsion reviews reinforce that delays devastate salvage, which is particularly relevant in adolescents [^116uYC7w] [^114cnYRg].

> Next, I will examine additional anatomic and endocrine issues so I don't miss anything: an associated patent processus vaginalis increases inguinal hernia risk, persistent undescended position predisposes to testicular atrophy, and even spontaneously descended testes can re-ascend and show impaired growth; endocrine correlations include inverse relationships between FSH and testicular volume and semen parameters, reflecting Sertoli cell/germinal compartment compromise over time [^111iMaQ4] [^116e6yGA] [^115SpXhb].

> Let me consider age-specific risk amplification at 13 years: guidelines have long recommended orchiopexy by 6–18 months to preserve fertility potential and mitigate malignancy risk; at 13, the child is a decade beyond the recommended window, and NEJM data show risk nearly doubles when correction occurs at ≥ 13 compared with < 13; histologic severity after age 9 further supports likely germ cell loss by early adolescence; in short, the missed window at 13 years magnifies all four risk domains compared with toddlers [^115g4hPo] [^112zK71z] [^1178UWL2] [^112bXHmK] [^111JYGZb] [^1147Ch6V].

> I should confirm immediate clinical priorities and avoid common pitfalls: first, if there is acute pain or tenderness in the groin/abdomen with a nonpalpable scrotal testis, torsion must be presumed and urgent surgical exploration should not be delayed for imaging when suspicion is high; if the exam is equivocal and time to OR is not immediate, Doppler can assist, but it should never postpone emergent exploration; second, for non-acute presentations at age 13, prompt referral to pediatric urology is mandatory — imaging is not recommended as a routine pre-referral step and can delay care; third, surgical decision-making in postpubertal patients may include orchiopexy if the testis appears viable and functional or orchiectomy if atrophic or intra-abdominal and high-risk, with bilateral or unilateral choices individualized to anatomy, endocrine status, and fertility goals [^114cnYRg] [^115oBJz1] [^117MpZbq] [^111hZV1G] [^1178UWL2] [^112cCP2Z] [^112TCoiG] [^112X5FJH].

> Wait, let me verify my cancer surveillance recommendations because I initially considered advocating annual ultrasound until age 35 based on a case report follow-up schema; but hold on, I should correct myself — high-quality guidelines emphasize education on testicular self-examination and periodic clinical examination after orchiopexy rather than routine ultrasound screening in asymptomatic adolescents and young adults, reserving ultrasound and tumor markers for concerning findings; counseling must explicitly cover the persistent increased malignancy risk despite surgical repositioning, which rises with later age at orchiopexy [^111q5yyL] [^116rkWMT] [^116HE4wQ] [^117PWghZ].

> I will now examine fertility preservation and assessment so I don't miss time-sensitive options: semen analysis at sexual maturity should be offered, particularly in bilateral cases or when testes are small/atrophic, with consideration of cryopreservation if oligospermia is found; inhibin B and gonadotropins can help gauge Sertoli and Leydig cell function in follow-up; even though men with prior acquired undescended testes often show diminished semen quality vs controls, outcomes vary, and early, individualized fertility counseling is prudent, especially if bilateral disease was present or surgery is delayed into puberty [^1142uf5D] [^116HWKXZ] [^111q5yyL].

> Let me think about endocrine monitoring more concretely: adolescents with long-standing cryptorchidism and those treated for testicular cancer are at increased risk of hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction over time, so periodic clinical assessment and targeted labs for testosterone, LH, FSH can be justified in symptomatic or high-risk patients; testicular volume correlates with spermatogenic parameters, and marked hypotrophy merits closer follow-up and counseling [^117KnH96] [^115SpXhb].

> I should double-check psychosocial aspects because adolescents process risk differently: cryptorchidism is linked with anxiety about cancer, body image, and fertility, so structured counseling on realistic risks, surveillance, and fertility options is essential; primary care and surgical teams should reinforce testicular self-exam skills and provide developmentally appropriate education and support [^111iMaQ4] [^116rkWMT].

> But wait, what if the presentation is unilateral and the testis is palpably inguinal and viable at 13 — does orchiopexy still help? Yes, orchiopexy at this age facilitates surveillance and may preserve residual function, though it does not normalize cancer risk, whereas a frankly atrophic or intra-abdominal testis found after puberty may reasonably be considered for orchiectomy after careful endocrine and fertility counseling; decisions should be individualized and explicitly documented with shared decision-making [^1178UWL2] [^112cCP2Z] [^112TCoiG].

> Synthesizing for a 13-year-old with cryptorchidism: immediate concerns include the possibility of torsion with low salvage if diagnosis is delayed, a substantially elevated and lifelong malignancy risk that increases with pubertal-age correction, compromised fertility potential especially if bilateral or long-standing, and associated hernia/atrophy risks; urgent urologic evaluation with timely surgery is indicated, imaging should not delay management, and long-term care should focus on education for self-exam with periodic clinical review, individualized fertility/endocrine assessment, and clear counseling that late orchiopexy aids surveillance and may preserve remaining function but does not erase cancer risk; I need to ensure this plan is anchored in guidelines and adjusted to unilateral vs bilateral anatomy and testicular viability at surgery [^116uYC7w] [^112bXHmK] [^115g4hPo] [^1178UWL2] [^116rkWMT].

Cryptorchidism in a 13-year-old carries significant risks: **testicular cancer risk is 2–8 times higher** [^112bXHmK] than in the general population [^116hEpua], especially with intra-abdominal testes or delayed orchiopexy [^114TapHd]. Fertility is often impaired due to **abnormal spermatogenesis** [^1158yn2N] [^1142uf5D], with higher risk of **subfertility or infertility** if bilateral or if surgery is delayed [^117PWghZ]. Additional complications include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, testicular atrophy, hypogonadism, and psychological distress [^111iMaQ4]. Early orchiopexy (before 18 months) reduces these risks [^115g4hPo] [^112GYnbU], but delayed surgery in adolescence necessitates ongoing surveillance and counseling [^116rkWMT] [^117PWghZ].

---

## Malignancy risk

- **Increased risk of testicular cancer**: Cryptorchidism is associated with a significantly increased risk of testicular cancer, particularly germ cell tumors such as seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors [^116hEpua]. The risk is approximately 2–8 times higher than in the general population [^112bXHmK].

- **Impact of delayed orchiopexy**: Delayed surgical correction (orchiopexy) beyond puberty significantly increases the risk of malignancy [^112bXHmK]. Early orchiopexy (before 18 months) reduces but does not eliminate this risk [^114TapHd].

- **Intra-abdominal testes**: Testes located intra-abdominally have a higher malignancy risk compared to inguinal or prescrotal testes [^115zojP6].

---

## Fertility impairment

- **Abnormal spermatogenesis**: Cryptorchidism leads to impaired spermatogenesis due to prolonged exposure of the testis to higher intra-abdominal temperatures [^1158yn2N], resulting in reduced sperm count, motility, and abnormal morphology [^1142uf5D] [^111JYGZb].

- **Bilateral cryptorchidism**: Bilateral undescended testes significantly increase the risk of infertility compared to unilateral cases [^117PWghZ] [^116HWKXZ].

- **Delayed orchiopexy**: Surgical correction after puberty does not fully restore normal spermatogenesis, leading to persistent subfertility or infertility [^112GYnbU] [^115zojP6].

---

## Testicular torsion

Increased risk stems from **abnormal positioning** and **lack of scrotal fixation**, which make undescended testes more prone to torsion [^114cnYRg]. Testicular loss may occur because torsion can cause **ischemia and necrosis**, leading to eventual loss of the testis if not promptly treated [^116uYC7w].

---

## Inguinal hernia

A patent **processus vaginalis** is often associated with cryptorchidism, increasing the risk of inguinal hernia. Hernia complications can include **incarceration**, **strangulation**, and **bowel obstruction** if not surgically corrected [^111iMaQ4].

---

## Testicular atrophy

Progressive **atrophy** occurs in long-standing undescended testes due to impaired blood supply, increased temperature, and hormonal dysfunction [^116e6yGA]. Irreversible damage often follows delayed surgical intervention, leading to **testicular atrophy** and the need for **orchiectomy** [^115zojP6].

---

## Hormonal dysfunction

Patients may develop **hypogonadism**, with reduced testosterone production, delayed puberty, and impaired secondary sexual characteristics. These **endocrine abnormalities** can persist even after surgical correction, requiring long-term hormonal monitoring and management [^112X5FJH].

---

## Psychological and psychosocial impact

In adolescents with cryptorchidism, **body image issues** can contribute to significant psychological distress, anxiety, and depression due to perceived differences from peers. Exposure to **social stigma** may lead to bullying and reduced self-esteem, negatively affecting overall quality of life.

---

## Surgical complications

Complications of **orchiopexy** include infection, hematoma, testicular atrophy, and recurrent undescended testis. Complications of **orchiectomy** may involve psychological distress and hormonal imbalance, particularly in post-pubertal patients with atrophic testes.

---

## Long-term surveillance and follow-up

Adolescents with cryptorchidism require **regular follow-up** including clinical examination, ultrasound, and hormonal evaluation to monitor for recurrence, malignancy, and hormonal dysfunction. Comprehensive **patient education** should address the increased risk of malignancy and infertility and emphasize the importance of regular self-examination and ongoing medical follow-up [^117PWghZ] [^116HE4wQ].

---

Cryptorchidism in a 13-year-old adolescent is associated with significant complications, including increased risk of malignancy, fertility impairment, testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, testicular atrophy, hormonal dysfunction, psychological distress, and surgical complications. Early **surgical intervention** and **regular follow-up** are essential to minimize these risks and ensure optimal long-term outcomes.

### Cryptorchidism (undescended testicle) [^116rkWMT]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Cryptorchidism refers to an undescended testicle, the most common genitourinary malformation in male children. It is diagnosed through history and physical examination findings, where primary care physicians play a critical role in early identification. Early surgical intervention reduces the risk of testicular cancer and preserves fertility. Patients should be referred for surgical intervention at six months of age or at the time of diagnosis if the child is older. After surgery, patients require lifelong surveillance and counseling regarding fertility implications and an increased risk of testicular conditions.

- **Endocrinologic evaluation**: Patients with bilateral undescended testicles that are nonpalpable should undergo endocrinologic evaluation for sexual development disorders.
- **Retractile testicles**: These are a variant of cryptorchidism and should be monitored annually until puberty, when acquired ascent becomes unlikely due to greater testicular volume.

Based on expert opinion, all patients with a history of cryptorchidism should undergo annual clinical examination and be taught self-examination techniques for early detection of testicular cancer.

### Acquired cryptorchidism: More harm than thought [^111JYGZb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired cryptorchidism (AC) has been recognized as a subgroup of undescended testes (UDT). There is growing evidence that its compromising effect equals that of congenital UDT (cUDT). This prospective study included an extensive histological examination of biopsies taken from AC patients.

- **Patients and methods**: From August 2013 to December 2014, 21 boys (3–12 years of age) underwent testicular biopsy during orchiopexy for AC. Patient and family histories were recorded. The amount of germ cells (GC) per tubule (T) and the amount of adult dark spermatogonia (Ad-S) per T were determined by resin semi-thin sections examination. The samples were also scanned for signs of malformation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed as markers for atypical germ cells.

- **Results**: Four (19%) boys were born prematurely, two (9.5%) were small for gestational age (SGA), and nine (43%) had a positive family history of UDT. The median of GC/T was 1.06 in boys < 9 years and 0.60 in boys ≥ 9 years. The median of Ad-S/T was 0.02 in boys < 9 years and 0.01 in boys ≥ 9 years. There were no signs of malformation, and no atypical cells were found. The immunohistochemical stains were negative in all specimens.

- **Conclusions**: Prematurity, SGA, and a positive family history appeared to be predictors for AC. Extensive histopathological examination of AC revealed a significant reduction of germ cell count and fertility markers, comparable with that in cUDT. The alterations were more severe in boys aged ≥ 9 years. It is unclear whether this was possibly caused by a longer duration of inguinal position.

### Fertility potential in a cohort of 65 men with previously acquired undescended testes [^1142uf5D]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate testicular function in men with previously acquired undescended testes (AUDT), where spontaneous descent was awaited until puberty, followed by orchiopexy in cases of nondescent, the study employed several methods. An andrological evaluation was conducted, including assessments of paternity, scrotal ultrasound, reproductive hormones, and semen analysis. Participants were categorized into three groups: men with AUDT, healthy controls, and men with previously congenital undescended testes (CUDT).

In comparison with controls, men with AUDT had significantly more abnormal testicular consistency, smaller testes, lower sperm concentration, and less motile sperm. Except for a more normal testicular consistency often observed in men with AUDT, no differences were identified between men with AUDT and men with CUDT. Furthermore, no differences were found between men with AUDT who experienced spontaneous descent and those who underwent orchiopexy.

Fertility potential in men with AUDT appears compromised compared to healthy controls, but is comparable with men with CUDT. This suggests that congenital and acquired UDT may share the same etiology. However, no significant difference was found between men who had spontaneous descent and those requiring orchiopexy. Notably, fertility potential remains unknown for men undergoing immediate surgery at diagnosis, highlighting the need for future research in this area.

### Age at surgery for undescended testis and risk of testicular cancer [^112bXHmK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Undescended testis, a risk factor for testicular cancer, is usually treated surgically; however, the impact of the age at treatment on cancer risk remains unclear. We studied the relationship between age at treatment for undescended testis and the subsequent risk of testicular cancer.

- **Methods**: We identified men who underwent orchiopexy for undescended testis in Sweden between 1964 and 1999. Cohort subjects were identified in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and were followed for the occurrence of testicular cancer through the Swedish Cancer Registry. Vital statistics and data on migration status were sourced from the Register of Population and Population Changes for 1965 through 2000. We estimated the relative risk of testicular cancer using Poisson regression of standardized incidence ratios, comparing the risk in the cohort with that in the general population. Additionally, data were analyzed using Cox regression with internal comparison groups.

- **Results**: The cohort included 16,983 men who were surgically treated for undescended testis and followed over a total of 209,984 person-years. We identified 56 cases of testicular cancer during follow-up. The relative risk of testicular cancer among those who underwent orchiopexy before the age of 13 was 2.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.58 to 3.06), compared with the Swedish general population. For those treated at age 13 or older, the relative risk was 5.40 (95% CI, 3.20 to 8.53). The effect of age at orchiopexy on the risk of testicular cancer was similar in comparisons within the cohort.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^115g4hPo]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for cryptorchidism, specifically in relation to orchidopexy, the EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend performing surgical orchidofunicolysis and orchidopexy before the age of 12 months, and by 18 months at the latest.

### Prepubertal orchiopexy for cryptorchidism may be associated with lower risk of testicular cancer [^114TapHd]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Indications for orchiopexy are to decrease the risk of infertility and to facilitate testicular self-examination. Although the increased risk of germ cell cancer in cryptorchid testes is undisputed, it is unclear whether orchiopexy affects the natural history of testis cancer development. We hypothesize that early orchiopexy is protective against the subsequent development of testicular germ cell cancer.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Studies pertaining to cryptorchidism and testicular cancer risk were retrieved by searching MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Library, using cryptorchidism as a keyword, combined with treatment, orchiopexy, testis, and cancer. For data extraction, exposure was dichotomized to orchiopexy before or after age 10 to 11 years, while the outcome was defined as the development of testicular germ cell cancer. Summary risk measures were calculated using the random effects model.

Four studies met our criteria. Review of all studies revealed an increased risk of testicular cancer if orchiopexy was delayed until after age 10 to 11 years or was never performed. Odds ratios ranged from 2.9 to 32.0. Meta-analysis showed that testicular cancer was nearly 6 times more likely (OR 5.8 [1.8, 19.3]) to develop in men in whom orchiopexy was delayed or was not performed, compared to those in whom it was performed early.

Prepubertal orchiopexy may decrease the risk of testicular cancer. Thus, early surgical intervention is indicated in children with cryptorchidism.

### Association between male genital anomalies and adult male reproductive disorders: A population-based data linkage study spanning more than 40 years [^116hEpua]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Low credibility.

The male genital anomalies hypospadias and undescended testes have been linked to adult male reproductive disorders, testicular cancer, and decreased fertility. Few population-based studies have evaluated their effects on adult fertility outcomes and, in the case of undescended testes, the importance of early corrective surgery (orchidopexy).

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study of all liveborn boys in Western Australia from 1970 to 1999 and followed them until 2016 via data linkage to registries for hospital admissions, congenital anomalies, cancer, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Study factors were hypospadias or undescended testes, and study outcomes included testicular cancer, paternity, and use of ART for male infertility. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations between genital anomalies and testicular cancer or paternity, and log-binomial regression was used to calculate relative risks (RRs) for the associations between genital anomalies and use of ART.

- **Findings**: The cohort comprised 350,835 boys, of whom 2,484 (0.7%) had been diagnosed with hypospadias, and 7,499 (2.1%) with undescended testes. There were 505 (0.1%) cases of testicular cancer, 109,471 (31.2%) men had fathered children, and 2,682 (0.8%) had undergone fertility treatment with ART. Undescended testes was associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of testicular cancer (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.65–3.58) and hypospadias with an almost 40% increase (HR 1.37, 95% CI 0.51–3.67), although this increase was not significant.

### What is new in cryptorchidism and hypospadias — a critical review on the testicular dysgenesis hypothesis [^111s4cYF]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that poor semen quality, testis cancer, undescended testis, and hypospadias are symptoms of one underlying entity — the testicular dysgenesis syndrome — leading to increasing male fertility impairment. Though testicular cancer has increased in many Western countries during the past 40 years, hypospadias rates have not changed with certainty over the same period. Recent studies demonstrate that sperm output may have declined in certain areas of Europe but is probably not declining globally, as indicated by American studies. However, there is increasing recognition of male infertility related to obesity and smoking.

There is no certain evidence that the rates of undescended testes have been increasing over the last 50 years. In more than 95% of cases, hypospadias is not associated with cryptorchidism, suggesting major differences in pathogenesis. Placental abnormality may occasionally cause both cryptorchidism and hypospadias, as is the case in many other congenital malformations. The findings of early orchidopexy lowering the risk of both infertility and testicular cancer suggest that the abnormal location exposes the cryptorchid testis to infertility and malignant transformation, rather than there being a primary abnormality. Statistically, 5% of testicular cancers are caused by cryptorchidism. These data point to the complexity of pathogenic and epidemiologic features of each component and the difficulties in ascribing them to a single unifying process, such as testicular dysgenesis syndrome.

### Further evidence for acquired undescended testicle in the UK and its incompatibility with current recommendations in the Hall Report [^111ZEWQL]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The 4th edition of the Hall Report [Hall DMB. Health for all children. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2003. p. 167] states that undiagnosed undescended testicles at the age of 5 years or later should not be observed if its recommendations for diagnosis are followed. This study examines whether those recommendations can be relied upon.

A retrospective audit was conducted involving 228 boys who underwent orchidopexy between January 1992 and December 2003 at the County Hospital Hereford, UK. During this period, 10,048 boys were born at the hospital. Child health records, hospital records, and some GP records were reviewed.

A total of 103 boys (45%) were treated before their 5th birthday, and 125 (55%) were treated after the age of 5. Ninety-three orchidopexies resulted from diagnoses made at birth or six weeks; however, 83 procedures were performed on boys documented as having scrotally placed testes at both birth and six weeks. An additional 21 had records of scrotal testes either at birth (14) or at six weeks (7) but not both. The records of the remaining 31 cases are either missing or did not yield the required information, largely due to the introduction of the Parent Held Child Record after their time.

The literature review indicated that these findings concur with other studies, particularly a recent study from The Netherlands, which led to a new classification of undescended testis, highlighting the concept of the 'acquired undescended testicle'. The progressive nature of this condition was evident from the review of case notes.

### Clinical characteristics and outcome of children with acute cryptorchid testicular torsion: A single-center, retrospective case series study [^116uYC7w]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism and testicular torsion (TT) are relatively common conditions in clinical practice; however, sparse information about cryptorchid TT is available in the literature.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and long-term outcomes of pediatric patients treated for acute cryptorchid TT.

- **Results**: We found eight patients with unilateral acute cryptorchid TT with a prevalence of 8.9% (8/90) among all TT cases. The left testis was affected in six patients. The median age of patients at the time of surgery was 65 months (interquartile range (IQR) 4–136 months). The median duration of symptoms was 16 hours (IQR 9–25 hours), while the median time to treatment was 60 minutes (IQR 59–63 minutes). The most common symptoms were pain (abdominal and inguinal) and inguinal mass with no palpable testis in the ipsilateral hemiscrotum. Preoperative color Doppler ultrasonography revealed absent or decreased testicular blood flow in the affected testes in 7/8 of patients. Various degrees of testicular torsion (median 540°, min 360°, max 1260°) were found during surgery. A necrotic testis that led to orchidectomy was found in 4/8 of patients. The median follow-up period was 42.6 months (IQR 12.5–71.2 months), revealing only one patient with testicular atrophy. The final testicular salvage rate was 35%.

- **Conclusions**: Greater awareness among caregivers and primary care physicians about acute cryptorchid TT is required to improve their timely diagnosis and treatment. A physical examination of the external genitalia and inguinal region is essential.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^113oHmfD]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Undescended testicle (UT) is present at birth with a frequency varying from 2% to 8%: in Italy, the estimated prevalence is 3.5% in term babies. UT includes both a non-palpable testis and a palpable supra-scrotal testis, which cannot be pulled down to the scrotum or does not remain there by six months of age. UT should be differentiated from retractile testis (RT). RT is a condition where the testis is palpable in the supra-scrotal region but, once pulled down to the scrotum, remains there after the exhaustion of the cremasteric activity. In this case, RT should not be treated. Differential diagnosis between a true RT and a supra-scrotal UT may not be easy.

The difficulty in achieving consensus on UT management depends largely on the long follow-up from diagnosis until the attainment of full testicular function in adulthood. An up-to-date evidence-based consensus on the treatment of UT has been published with the following recommendations:

- **Hormonal treatment**: Hormones are not recommended.
- **Timing of orchidopexy**: Orchidopexy should be performed between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis if it occurs later.
- **Surgical expertise**: Orchidopexy should be performed at centers with both pediatric surgeons or urologists and pediatric anesthesiologists.

These recommendations, in line with those by Swiss surgeons, are important to avoid adulthood consequences of UT, such as azoospermia or oligospermia, endocrine insufficiency, and possible tumoral degeneration.

Retractile testis (RT) may be more difficult to diagnose. According to the consensus, RT should not undergo surgery but should be followed up once yearly.

### A narrative review of the history and evidence-base for the timing of orchidopexy for cryptorchidism [^1147Ch6V]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Consensus recommendations for surgical management of cryptorchidism advocate for orchidopexy to be performed between 6 and 18 months of age. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the scheduling of elective surgeries, impacting these recommendations.

In response to the pandemic, this review aimed to examine the available data on the natural history, surgical management, and risks associated with infertility and cancer in cryptorchid testes. The goal is to equip parents, referring providers, and surgeons with the necessary information for making informed decisions about whether to proceed with or delay orchidopexy.

A retrospective review and analysis were conducted on all relevant articles regarding cryptorchidism's natural history, surgical management, and associated infertility and cancer risks, sourced from PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library.

The quality of historical literature on the effects of cryptorchidism on fertility and malignancy is variable, with less reliable data available concerning fertility. Cryptorchid testes may exhibit histological differences from birth, some of which could indicate future fertility outcomes. Men who were formerly unilaterally cryptorchid have slightly reduced, but not significantly different, paternity rates compared to the general population. Additionally, cryptorchid testes are at increased risk for germ cell carcinogenesis, with substantial evidence indicating that the risk for malignancy significantly rises after puberty.

The body of evidence on the risks of future infertility and testicular cancer supports the consensus recommendations for the timing of orchidopexy.

### Reproductive markers of testicular function and size during puberty in boys with and without a history of cryptorchidism [^1158yn2N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism (undescended testis, maldescensus testis) is a condition in which one or both testes fail to reach the normal position at the bottom of the scrotum. Congenital cryptorchidism is the most common congenital anomaly among newborn boys, with a prevalence at birth of 1.1% to 8.4% in boys with a birth weight over 2500 g. Some testes can descend spontaneously after birth, which mostly occurs before the age of 3 to 6 months. The prevalence of cryptorchidism both at 3 and 12 months of age is approximately 1%.

Cryptorchidism is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors and an increased risk of infertility due to impaired spermatogenesis. The consequences of cryptorchidism on testicular endocrine development during puberty are still unclear. Orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months and 18 months at the latest is nowadays the recommended treatment for cryptorchidism.

### Five testicles in the genital area of a thirteen-month-old baby: A case report [^112fWLmW]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

One of the congenital anomalies of the urogenital system is polyorchidism, also known as supernumerary testis, which refers to the presence of more than two testes. It is a sporadic phenomenon, with no additional cases reported in the literature. More than 50% of all reported cases (fewer than 200 cases) are detected in individuals between the ages of 10 to 25 years. Most discovered cases have involved fewer than four testicles. In this case, we report a 13-month-old with five testicles.

### Risk factors for undescended testis [^116dycYN]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2012). Low credibility.

To contribute to the understanding of the etiology of undescended testis (UDT), this study explores a wide range of potential risk factors in a case-referent study.

- **Patients and methods**: Cases and referents were recruited at five hospitals and included 200 boys with surgically corrected UDT and 629 boys with persistent middle ear effusion. Risk factor data were obtained by postal questionnaires sent to both parents. Clinical data were collected from medical files. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression.

- **Results**: The main findings include associations between UDT and several factors: familial occurrence of the disorder (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9–4.9), low birth weight (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1–4.3), twinning (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9–5.4), gestational preeclampsia (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8–4.4), use of oral contraceptives after conception (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.0–12.5), in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.8–6.0), paternal subfertility (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.8–4.1), and maternal occupational exposure to cosmetics (OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9–10.0). Subgroup analyses indicated differences in ORs for several factors between cases with (n = 92) and without (n = 103) inguinal hernia or hydrocele.

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest a role for genetic predisposition, placental insufficiency, and possibly exposure to specific endocrine-disrupting substances in the etiology of UDT. Further research should consider potential etiologic differences between subgroups of cases with UDT.

### Orchidopexy trends in the paediatric population of Victoria, 1999–2006 [^114DKRC9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

In recent times, much concern has been expressed in the media about male reproductive health. Undescended testis is a significant contributor to male infertility and testicular cancer. The recommended management is orchidopexy. Recent studies in the United Kingdom have shown a decline in orchidopexy rates in the paediatric population. An analysis of the orchidopexy rate in Victoria was therefore conducted to determine whether a similar trend existed and what factors may contribute toward this.

- **Methods**: Data were extracted from hospital records using operation codes for orchidopexies for all patients between 0 and 18 years in the state of Victoria. Victorian population data were collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Data were grouped into orchidopexy age groups 0 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10 to 18 and compared across calendar years using graphical and statistical analysis.

- **Main results**: On average, the rate of operations on 0 to 4-year-old patients reduced by 2.1% each year over the period; the 95% confidence interval for the rate of reduction was 0.4% to 3.8% (P < 0.014). The rate of operations on 5 to 9-year-old patients reduced by 6.3% each year over the period; the 95% confidence interval for the rate of reduction was 3.7% to 8.8% (P < 0.005). The rate of operations on 10 to 14-year-old patients reduced by 5.7% each year over the period; the 95% confidence interval for the rate of reduction was 1.9% to 9.3% (P = 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: In the state of Victoria, there has been a true decline in the number of orchidopexy operations done in the paediatric population.

### Society for Endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^115Wwi6k]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

It is generally accepted that investigations are necessary in cases where the appearance of the genitalia is ambiguous to the extent that sex assignment is not possible at birth, or the appearance is inconsistent with any prenatal genetic tests. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer. Before presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of atypical genitalia may be as high as 1 in 300 births; however, the birth prevalence of a condition that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination might be as low as 1 in 5000 births.

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who appear to be a boy with atypical genitalia and those who appear to be a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that a girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or as an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus, and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may sometimes only become evident after further examination.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^1147Vkwh]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Primary undescended testis is the most common congenital anomaly of the urogenital system and the most common disorder in pediatric surgery, affecting up to 30% of preterm and 3% of term infants worldwide. The non-scrotal position of the testis bears a considerable risk for the development of both uni- and contralateral testicular malignancy as well as impaired fertility. Testicular descent takes place at two stages under the control of insulin-like hormone 3 between 8 and 15 weeks of development, as well as androgens facilitate inguinoscrotal migration afterwards. Although extensive research is dedicated to improving understanding of the morphological complexity involved in this process, the exact cause of cryptorchidism remains elusive. Relevant risk factors include prematurity, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders (e.g. disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis), small-for-gestational-age (SGA), birth weight less than 2500 g, as well as environmental factors such as nicotine, alcohol, and pesticides. Ten percent of cases are bilateral and are commonly associated with complex syndromes or other congenital malformations, such as abdominal wall defects or neural tube defects. Spontaneous descent occurs in approximately 70% of cases, mostly within the first three to six months of life. After six months of age, therapeutic intervention is indicated, as spontaneous descent is then unlikely.

### Testicular function in men treated in childhood for undescended testes [^115SpXhb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate testicular hormones and sperm counts of young men treated in childhood for cryptorchidism.

- **Methods**: Testicular volume, serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone, as well as semen specimens, were evaluated in 57 men (mean age, 19 years; range, 18 to 27 years) treated in childhood for unilateral (n = 47) and bilateral (n = 10) cryptorchidism. In 3 unilateral cases, monorchidism was found. Thirty-seven patients underwent orchiopexy after hormonal treatment (luteinizing hormone-releasing factor, 1.2 mg/d for 28 days followed by human chorionic gonadotropin, 500 IU intramuscularly 3 times a week for 3 weeks). The remainder underwent surgery. The mean age at surgical treatment was 5.4 years (range, 2 to 12 years). These patients were examined again following a mean period of 13.3 years (range, 10 to 19 years).

- **Results**: Reduced testicular volume (< 12 mL) was found in 6 of 64 testes (9.3%). LH, FSH, and testosterone levels were found within the normal range in all patients. Through linear regression, inverse relations were found between FSH and, respectively, testicular volume (P = .002), sperm concentration (P = .013), sperm motility (P = .023), and normally shaped sperms (P = .019). There were direct relations between testicular volume and sperm concentration (P = .02), sperm motility (P = .000), and normally shaped sperms (P = .001). We did not find any statistical correlation between age at surgery and semen quality. Significantly better results in terms of sperm counts were found in patients directly operated on.

### Management of undescended testes: European Association of Urology/European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines [^115zojP6]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Undescended testis is the most common endocrinological disease in the male newborn period. Incidence varies between 1.0% and 4.6% in full-term neonates, with rates as high as 45% in preterm neonates. Failure or delay of treatment can result in reduced fertility and/or increased testicular cancer risk in adulthood.

- **Objective**: To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of boys with undescended testes, which reduce the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer in adulthood.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Embase and PubMed were searched for all relevant publications from 1990 to 2015, limited to English language. Data were narratively synthesized in light of methodological and clinical heterogeneity. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is consensus that early treatment, by 18 months at the latest, for undescended testes is mandatory to avoid possible sequelae regarding fertility potential and cancer risk. The standard therapy is orchidopexy, while hormonal therapy is still under debate. However, in some individuals, the successful scrotal placement of previously undescended testes may not prevent potential negative long-term outcomes regarding fertility and testicular malignancy.

- **Conclusions**: There is good evidence for early placement of undescended testes in the scrotal position to prevent potential impairment of fertility and reduce the risk of testicular malignancy. No consensus exists on the various forms of hormonal treatment, which are assessed on an individual basis.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^113Nv4NE]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The primary endpoint of this retrospective cross-sectional study was a documented orchidopexy of patients with UDT in their first year of life according to guideline recommendations. The confirmatory analysis was based on a two-sided Fisher test (5% level of significance), comparing the relative frequencies of children operated in accordance with versus contrary to guideline recommendations. In addition, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the difference of these frequencies was estimated.

- **Exploratory evaluations**: A stratification of this comparison was conducted for hospitals with and without a department of pediatric surgery. Respective Fisher tests and confidence intervals were then performed at the local 5% significance level without correction for multiplicity. The anonymized survey was analyzed descriptively; its results were reported with absolute and relative frequencies.

All analyses were conducted with SPSS® (Version 21.0 for Windows®). For significance and confidence validation, the software R® was utilized.

### Five testicles in the genital area of a thirteen-month-old baby: A case report [^111S6xBT]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The case involved a 13-month-old baby weighing 9.7 kg, born at 3.5 kg. He was the second male child in a family living in a village in Ardabil, Iran. The child was referred to the hospital due to undescended testis (UDT), with one testis found in the abdomen and another in the inguinal canal, detected via ultrasound. Given the infant's age, the family history was explored to examine the issue further. It was noted that there was a history of UDT in the family, as the baby's older brother had undergone orchiopexy surgery for UDT four years prior. During the mother's pregnancy, she received daily progesterone injections for a week due to hemorrhage. The pregnancy proceeded healthily, and the baby was delivered via cesarean section.

Due to the complete similarity in appearance to testis, as shown in images, a biopsy was not performed to avoid potential interference with the primary delicate perfusion of the testicular tissue. The baby was referred to our center due to bilateral UDT and a nonpalpable testicle on the right side. Sonography, however, showed both testicles in the proximal inguinal canal. The scrotum had not developed, and HCG therapy was initiated by the pediatrician. Other clinical signs were typical.

Surgical intervention was planned for the patient. Prior to surgery, the patient received four HCG 1200u injections over the course of a month (one per week) to promote testicular descent. Despite this intervention, the issue was not completely resolved, and no further diagnostic challenges arose. The patient underwent a surgical procedure under general anesthesia for both diagnostic purposes and as a final treatment stage.

### Five testicles in the genital area of a thirteen-month-old baby: a case report [^112vQdHh]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Polyorchidism is a congenital anomaly of the urogenital system and means having more than two testes. It is a rare phenomenon, with no more than 200 reported cases in the literature. In this case, we report a 13-month-old with five testicles.

- **Case presentation**: We report a rare instance of five testicles in the genital area of a 13-month-old baby. The initial diagnosis was undescended testis (UDT) based on ultrasound findings where one testis in the abdomen and one in the inguinal canal were detected. Surgery with general anesthesia was performed to diagnose and treat this case. Four HCG 1200u injections were administered before surgery. During the operation, it was determined that the patient had five testicles. The testicles were located on the left in the proximal inguinal canal, and the sac hernia was ligated parallel to the inner ring. The patient was followed up several times after surgery by a urologist, and the results showed no problems; the intervention was uncomplicated.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the results, it is not possible to diagnose such cases only by examination or ultrasound in infant patients, as the patient often presents with undescended testis (UDT), making diagnosis only feasible through surgery.

### Undescended testis: A roundtable discussion based on clinical scenarios - Part 1 [^114XEth1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genital tract. Despite its high incidence, the management of UDT varies between specialties, including urology, pediatric surgery, pediatric urology, and pediatric endocrinology. Therefore, as the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we requested experts around the world to express their personal approaches against various case scenarios of UDT to explore their individual reasoning. We intended to broaden the perspectives of our colleagues who deal with the treatment of this frequent genital malformation.

### Ipsilateral polyorchidism with cryptorchidism in a pediatric patient: A rare case report from a resource-limited setting [^111q5yyL]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Although the supernumerary testis was atrophic, long-term follow-up is essential to monitor the preserved undescended testis for malignancy — a risk elevated in cryptorchidism. While no specific guidelines exist for polyorchidism, annual clinical and ultrasound surveillance is prudent, even in LMICs. This case demonstrates that orchidopexy alone can yield favorable outcomes when viability is confirmed intraoperatively, with no atrophy observed at 12 months.

- **Follow-up plan**:

	- **Hormonal surveillance**: Annual serum testosterone, LH, FSH, and inhibin B from age 12 (pre-puberty) to monitor Leydig/Sertoli cell function. Accelerate testing if pubertal delay or asymmetry occurs.

	- **Fertility assessment**: Semen analysis at sexual maturity; consider cryopreservation if oligospermia. Monitor inhibin B as a surrogate marker of spermatogenic reserve.

	- **Malignancy surveillance**: Annual testicular ultrasound until age 35 (peak malignancy risk: 15–35 years). Educate on monthly self-examinations at puberty. Measure tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG) if ultrasound findings are suspicious.

### Growth of spontaneously descended and surgically treated testes during early childhood [^116e6yGA]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

To investigate whether in congenital unilateral cryptorchidism the growth of a spontaneously descended testis is normal, compared with the contralateral scrotal testis, or similar to the growth of testes that failed to descend spontaneously and later underwent orchidopexy, ninety-one boys with congenital unilateral cryptorchidism and later spontaneous descent of the initially retained testis were followed from birth (0–3 weeks) up to 5 years of age. They were compared with boys randomized to surgery at either 9 months (n = 78) or 3 years of age (n = 85). Testicular volume was determined with ultrasonography.

Eighty-two percent of spontaneous descent occurred before 2 months of age. However, 22% of these descended testes were later again found in a retained position. The spontaneously descended testis was smaller than its scrotal counterpart at all ages (P < .001). A significant difference in testicular volume was observed between the early and late treated boys from age 2 years onward. At 2, 4, and 5 years of age, the volumes of the spontaneously descended testes were significantly larger than those of boys operated on at 3 years but similar to those operated on at 9 months.

In conclusion, in boys with congenital unilateral cryptorchidism and later spontaneous descent, the originally retained testes show impaired growth compared to their scrotal counterparts from birth onward. They are also prone to later ascent to a retained position. Furthermore, the longer the testes remain untreated, the more they exhibit impaired growth.

### Guideline implementation for the treatment of undescended testes: Still room for improvement [^1158KMmS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Early orchidopexy (OP) around the age of 1 year is recommended in boys with congenital undescended testis (UDT) worldwide for decades. Former retrospective studies did not distinguish congenital from acquired UDT, resulting in a negative bias concerning the age at surgery.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective analysis, data of all boys who underwent OP in eight pediatric surgery institutions from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. Congenital or acquired UDT were differentiated. Patients were categorized into three groups according to age at surgery: (1) less than 12 months, (2) 12–24 months, and (3) more than 24 months. Data from one institution were analyzed in detail, including exact age of first referral, exact age at surgery, and intraoperative findings.

- **Results**: Out of 4448 boys, 3270 had congenital UDT. In 81% (2656 cases), surgery was performed beyond the age of 1 year, and in 54.4% (1780 cases), beyond the age of 2 years. Chi-square statistics showed a higher rate of early operations in hospitals compared to outpatient services, and in Germany compared to Switzerland. In 694 congenital detailed cases, the median age at referral was 13 months [range 0–196], and the median age at surgery was 15 months [range 0–202].

- **Conclusion**: Delayed referral is the main reason for guideline non-conformance, resulting in delayed surgery for UDT.

- **Type of study**: Clinical research paper.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III: Treatment study.

### Cryptorchidism in Sweden: A nationwide study of prevalence, operative management, and complications [^111aa8M2]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To review the cumulative prevalence, operative management, and complications of treatment for cryptorchidism in Sweden, a nationwide observational study was conducted using longitudinal register data of all Swedish-born boys aged 0–18 years diagnosed with cryptorchidism from 2001 to 2014. The primary outcomes were the occurrence and age at primary surgery, while secondary outcomes included the type of procedure and incidence of surgical site infection.

Of the 20,375 boys diagnosed with cryptorchidism between 2001 and 2014, 12,766 underwent surgical treatment. The cumulative childhood prevalence was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.5–2.0), with higher prevalence observed in boys born prematurely, small for gestational age, or with low birth weight. The median age at treatment decreased significantly from 6.2 years in 2001 to 3.4 years in 2014 (p < 0.001). Despite this, 94.1% (95% CI, 92.7–95.6) of surgeries in 2014 occurred after the recommended age of 1 year. Significant variations existed in the age at surgery between different counties within Sweden, ranging from 2.9 to 5.9 years of age. No deaths occurred within 30 days post-surgery, and the frequency of surgical site infections was low at 1.4% (95% CI, 1.1–1.6).

In conclusion, the cumulative childhood prevalence of cryptorchidism was high, and complications were rare. However, few boys underwent surgery in a timely manner according to clinical guidelines, with notable variability in standards of care across the country. Further research and collective actions are needed to improve the detection and management of congenital cryptorchidism.

### UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development [^113McrQZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

If the appearance of the external genitalia is sufficiently ambiguous to render sex assignment impossible, or the phenotype does not align with prenatal genetic tests, extensive investigation is required. The extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the observer's expertise. Prior to a clinical expert's evaluation, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of genital anomalies may be as high as one in 300 births; however, the prevalence of complex anomalies that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination could be as low as one in 5000 births.

In a clinical setting, besides those with truly ambiguous genitalia, infants can often be categorized as apparently male with atypical genitalia or apparently female with atypical genitalia. It is crucial to remember that girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may present as either an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, important clinical features of the external genitalia to examine include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of these folds, the size of the phallus, and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus. Sometimes, the actual site of the urinary meatus only becomes evident upon further examination.

### Five testicles in the genital area of a thirteen-month-old baby: a case report [^111MiKoG]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The left testis was located in the proximal inguinal canal, with the testicles also positioned on the left. The sac hernia was ligated parallel to the inner ring. Two testes in the proximal inguinal canal were connected by a long epididymis, with an incision made in the right inguinal region. We did not remove the supernumerary testis, which lacked a vas or epididymis, due to concerns about impairing the delicate artery of the main testis.

We did not perform genetic evaluations due to cost constraints. Ultrasound was conducted before surgery. The patient was monitored by a urologist for the placement of the testis in the scrotum sac after 48 hours, as well as 10 days, 1 month, and 3 months post-surgery. Post-surgical scrotal sonography detected all five testicles. The primary testicles were of standard size for the child's age, while the supernumerary testicles were smaller. Twelve months later, sonography showed no complications, and the intervention was uncomplicated according to the baby's age.

The frequency, significance, and possible etiology of testicular ascent (acquired cryptorchidism) are characterized in light of the known incidence and natural history of congenital cryptorchidism, and data provided by longitudinal and epidemiological studies of ascended testes and orchiopexy rates.

- **Materials and methods**: We comprehensively reviewed the literature addressing the epidemiology of congenital and acquired cryptorchidism and orchiopexy.

- **Results**: The incidence of congenital cryptorchidism in full-term males at birth is 2% to 4%, and at age 1 year is approximately 1%. This rate has not increased in the last few decades. The risk of ascent may be as high as 50% in cases where one testis is significantly retractile. Ascended testes are typically unilateral (77%), identified in mid-childhood, and located distal to the inguinal canal (77%). Ascended and significantly retractile testes may be prone to the same germ cell maldevelopment seen in congenital cryptorchidism. Cumulative orchiopexy rates in defined populations are 2% to 4%. The mean age at orchiopexy remains higher than expected (greater than 4 years), despite a long-held standard of care that includes a recommendation for surgery by age 2. These data suggest that cryptorchidism may be acquired in a significant subset of cases.

- **Conclusions**: With close monitoring of young boys, the spontaneous ascent of testes from a scrotal to a suprascrotal position may be observed over time, due to either true or apparent testicular ascent. This may lead to possible adverse effects on germ cell development and fertility potential.

### Cryptorchidism: A practical review for all community healthcare providers [^111iMaQ4]. Canadian Urological Association Journal = Journal de l'Association des Urologues du Canada (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cryptorchidism:

- **Definition**: Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is a common congenital abnormality among males characterized by the failure of one or both testes to permanently descend.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cryptorchidism is caused due to a disruption in any phase of testicular descent triggered by hereditary, hormonal, anatomical, environmental, or social factors.

- **Disease course**: The disruption in any phase of testicular descent results in cryptorchidism, which causes an increased chance of inguinal hernia, torsion, and trauma that leads to psychological distress in parents. It may also lead to reduced fertility and testicular cancer in adult males.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Orchiectomy for ASA 3 and ASA 4 is associated with 0.49% and 3.31% mortality risk.

### The nonpalpable testis: A narrative review [^113g7PRq]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

While the nonpalpable testis represents a small portion of all cryptorchid testes, it remains a clinical challenge for pediatric urologists. Controversy exists surrounding the best evaluation and management of this entity. In this review, we update what is known about the nonpalpable testis, including the etiology, preoperative evaluation, and best surgical management, as well as novel techniques and ongoing controversies.

We searched PubMed® and MEDLINE® from January 2000 to January 2017 using relevant key terms. Of the 367 articles, 115 were considered for inclusion based on a priori design. Using a narrative review format, an update on the evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis, including novel concepts and techniques, was synthesized.

The nonpalpable testis should be evaluated by physical examination only. Imaging is not indicated for routine cases. The optimal surgical approach and technique remain debatable, but several novel techniques have been described. Due to the rarity of the nonpalpable testis, randomized controlled trials and other quality comparisons are difficult, leading to controversial management practices.

Evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis remain challenging, and several aspects are still debated. Future research should focus on multi-institutional collaborative trials to determine the optimal operative management.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^117PWghZ]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for cryptorchidism, specifically with respect to general counseling, the EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend informing the patient or caregivers about:

- **The increased risk of malignancy**: An undescended testis is associated with a higher risk of malignancy, which increases with the age at orchidopexy.

- **Risk of malignancy with delayed treatment**: There is an increased risk of later malignancy with a failed or delayed orchidopexy; the earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer.

- **Fertility implications of unilateral undescended testis**: There are reduced rates of fertility associated with having a unilateral undescended testis.

- **Fertility and paternity implications of bilateral undescended testes**: There are reduced rates of fertility and paternity associated with bilateral undescended testes.

### Empty scrotum: Undescended testis or ectopic [^115Npzpp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This case of ectopic testis highlights the importance of a thorough first newborn examination, followed by a senior review when appropriate, and the expertise required to interpret neonatal ultrasounds. Following a provisional diagnosis of a unilateral undescended testicle in a newborn, an ultrasound scan was unable to correctly identify the condition, resulting in a delay in diagnosis. The condition was later recognized incidentally, which led to a successful surgical correction. Early clinical examination and recognition of ectopic testis allow for timely surgical intervention, preventing potential complications.

### Increased prevalence of some birth defects in Korea, 2009–2010 [^117GEQTj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The birth prevalence of undescended testis varies widely, ranging from 1.4 to 31.7 per 10,000. The study found very high rates of undescended testis in Korea (29.1 per 10,000), which aligns closely with data from Canada (31.7 per 10,000) but sharply contrasts with the low rate in France (1.4 per 10,000). On the other hand, the birth prevalence for hypospadias in this study (9.9 per 10,000) was similar to that reported in France (9.8 per 10,000).

In England, the prevalence of undescended testis increased by more than 60% between the 1950s and 1980s, with the reported prevalence of hypospadias ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 per 10,000 male births. A study conducted in North England identified space-time clustering among cases of hypospadias, but not cryptorchidism. The distribution of hypospadias cases may be predicted to exhibit spatial clustering if geographically varying environmental exposures are involved in their etiology. Space-time clustering occurs when an excess number of cases is observed within a small geographical area over a short period of time.

In Spain, the frequency of hypospadias has remained constant at 0.35% for the past few decades, with a decreasing frequency recorded only after 1996. The authors suggest that a radical change in exposure affecting the entire country during that decade is a probable cause of this trend in Spain. Unexpectedly, this pattern was not observed in the prevalence of any other birth defects.

A study conducted in China reported an average annual increase in the overall prevalence of hypospadias of 7.34% from 1996 to 2008, with geographical variation contributing to this increase.

### Cryptorchidism in children with Zika-related microcephaly [^11126Geg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

The genitourinary tract was recently identified as a potential site of complications related to the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). We provide the first report of a series of cryptorchidism cases in 3-year-old children with Zika-related microcephaly who underwent consultations between October 2018 and April 2019 as part of the follow-up of the children cohort of the Microcephaly Epidemic Research Group, Pernambuco, Brazil. Of the 22 males examined, eight (36.4%) presented with cryptorchidism. Among 14 undescended testis cases, 11 (78.6%) could be palpated in the inguinal region. Seven of the eight children had severe microcephaly. Conventional risk factors for cryptorchidism were relatively infrequent in these children. We hypothesize that cryptorchidism is an additional manifestation of CZS present in children with severe microcephaly. As in our cases, for most of the children, the testes were located in the inguinal region, and the possible mechanisms for cryptorchidism were gubernaculum disturbance or cremasteric abnormality.

### Five testicles in the genital area of a thirteen-month-old baby: A case report [^115Qts1c]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of five testicles is a rare and undesirable condition in children. In this case, the testicles were located in the proximal inguinal canal rather than in the abdomen. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), when combined with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increases the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting nonpalpable undescended testicles (UDT). However, due to the clinical findings and confirmation through sonography, an abdominal MRI was not performed in this instance.

- **Diagnosis and management**: Laparoscopy is the standard procedure for abdominal nonpalpable testicles, but it can be omitted if sonography confirms their inguinal location. Previous studies have shown that in conjunction with surgery, neo-adjuvant human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) therapy may induce and improve testis descent. Surgery was conducted to both diagnose and treat the condition in this case.

- **Postoperative considerations**: Continuous monitoring of the patient at various intervals is necessary. Rare cases should be approached cautiously, especially in patients with ultrasound-reported undescended testicles. During surgery, it is crucial to search for additional testicles, and to handle them carefully during orchiopexy. Combining testicles without separation is advisable to prevent damage to the epididymal system, sperm transfer, and spermatozoa.

### Surgical treatment of unilaterally undescended testes: Testicular growth after randomization to orchiopexy at age 9 months or 3 years [^112GYnbU]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We compared the growth of congenital, unilaterally undescended testes following orchiopexy at age 9 months or 3 years.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients were randomized to surgery at age 9 months (72) or 3 years (83). Testicular volume was measured by ultrasonography at ages 6, 12, 24, 39, and 48 months.

- **Results**: Orchiopexy at age 9 months resulted in an increase in testicular volume at subsequent measurements at ages 2, 3, and 4 years compared to the volume at 6 months (p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant growth was noted in the group treated at age 3 years. The improved testicular growth after early orchiopexy was also demonstrated by a gradual increase in the ratio of the previously retained testis and the scrotal testis in individual boys from 6 months to 4 years (0.68 to 0.81, p < 0.001). For the late treatment group, a significant decrease in this ratio was noted during the same period (0.68 to 0.56, p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Surgical treatment at 9 months resulted in partial catch-up of testicular growth until at least age 4 years compared to surgery at 3 years, clearly indicating that early surgery has a beneficial effect on testicular growth. Since testicular volume is an approximate indirect measure of spermatogenic activity, this gives hope that orchiopexy at this age may improve future spermatogenesis.

### 20 years of transcrotal orchidopexy for undescended testis: Results and outcomes [^11785YHw]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The role of the transcrotal approach to the undescended testis remains controversial despite its increasing popularity. The authors update their previously published series and review the literature on this subject, aiming to delineate the value of this technique.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a retrospective review of the transcrotal primary orchidopexy carried out to treat palpable undescended testis at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital between 1993 and 2005. A structured review of literature published since the proposal of this technique was also performed.

- **Results**: A total of 122 procedures were included. The transcrotal approach was successfully completed in 119 cases (97.5%). An additional groin incision was needed in three cases (2.5%) to further mobilize the spermatic cord. No immediate complications were recorded, and 8.4% required a reoperative procedure. On review of the literature, a total of 16 articles were discovered, spanning 1,695 transcrotal procedures, including the previously published authors' experience. On combining the data, the transcrotal approach required an additional groin incision in 4.4% of cases, 1.6% experienced immediate and/or early complications, and the overall recurrence rate was 2.0%.

- **Conclusions**: Transcrotal orchidopexy for the treatment of palpable undescended testes is a safe procedure with a long-term success rate comparable to the two-incision approach.

### Management of cryptorchidism: A survey of clinical practice in Italy [^114fw7RH]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The correct and timely management of children with cryptorchidism is important to promote gonadal development and to avoid the adulthood consequences of spermatogenesis defects. The results of our study allowed, for the first time, a description of how cryptorchidism was managed in Italy before the publication of the Consensus. Hormone therapy was used in about one quarter of the cases. The average age at surgery was much higher than recommended in the Consensus, and only 13% of children underwent surgery before 12 months of age.

Our results suggest that the spread of the Consensus guidelines on the management of cryptorchidism among all pediatricians is warranted in order to reduce the age at orchidopexy and to achieve a more homogeneous approach across Italy.

### Testicular adrenal rest tumor screening and fertility counseling among males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^111iX7Kd]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Reduced fertility is a common potential problem among males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), with nearly half experiencing impaired sperm production. The major cause of oligo/azoospermia in CAH is testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs). Studies indicate that ultrasound screening for TARTs should begin during childhood, yet it remains unclear whether boys with CAH are routinely screened for TARTs and/or counseled about infertility risk and potential interventions such as fertility testing and/or preservation.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to examine TART screening and fertility counseling practices among boys with CAH.

- **Study design**: An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was conducted of all males with ICD-9/10 codes for CAH (2007–2016) at a large pediatric academic center to examine: age and indication for diagnosis; age at first and last documented pediatric endocrinology and urology visit; history of ultrasound examinations; and documentation of fertility counseling.

- **Results**: Forty-six patients were included, of whom 38 had 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The median age at diagnosis was 2 weeks (range 7 days-10 years). The median age at the most recent pediatric endocrinology clinic visit was 14 years (range 2–42 years). Twenty-nine patients were over 11 years old (63% of the sample) at the time of the study, and 14 of these were over 18 years old (30% of the sample). Seven patients (15%) had a screening ultrasound at some point in their care, of whom three had TARTs. Fertility was mentioned in the records of six subjects (13% of the sample).

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^116L7sJu]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

These data point out an important shortcoming in pediatric health care, as it is well known that a delay in definite management of UDT leads to increased rates of subfertility, malignant transformation, and testicular torsion.

Despite the marked overall delay in operative treatment of UDT, our data reveals a positive trend regarding the timing of surgery. The guideline modification in 2009 led to a small but statistically significant increase in orchidopexies before the age of 3 (27% versus 22%). Even though this is an important step in the right direction, the state still bears improvement potential.

We observed an increase in the incidence of orchidopexies in the included hospitals of this study from 3.2 per 1,000,000 per year (2003–2008) to 6.4 per 1,000,000. This can only partly be explained by the continuous decrease in the general population number from 82.5 million in 2003 to 80.5 million inhabitants in 2012. Clearly, treatment numbers of the analyzed hospitals are increasing as hospitals expand, leading to rising numbers of treated cases. However, since we have analyzed 13 hospitals of a specific private hospital chain, the increase in the incidence of orchidopexies should not be mistaken for a general increase rate for this operation. In addition, the rise in early orchidopexies after the change of guidelines logically dictates that cases which would have been operated later in life and thus not in the analyzed period have, in fact, been operated earlier, hence resulting in an increase in orchidopexies.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^112HhRyE]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

- **Timing of orchidopexy in patients with undescended testis**

Table 2 and Figure 1 show the age distribution of all boys who received orchidopexy due to undescended testis (UDT) between 2003 and 2012 (n = 3587). A total of 41% of the patients were older than 4 years. From 2003 to 2008, 4% were operated on before age 1 and 22% before the age of 2. After the guideline recommendation was modified (including a one-year tolerance), only 5% were operated on in their first year of life and 27% before the age of 2. The respective 95% confidence intervals were [−3%; +1%; corresponding Fisher p = .209] for the incidence difference of children operated on in their first year of life and [−13%; −5%; corresponding Fisher p < .001] for the first two years of life. Figure 2 demonstrates the age distribution at the time of orchidopexy for all cases from 1 to 17 years of age before and after the change of the guideline recommendation, respectively. Considering only boys aged 4 years and younger, only 8% received orchidopexy in the first year of life from 2003 to 2008 and 9% from 2010 to 2012.

### Age at surgery and outcomes of an undescended testis [^116jxkJd]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common genital anomaly in boys. Guidelines recommend surgery before 12 months of age to maximize fertility and potentially reduce the risk of future malignancy. We investigated the prevalence of UDT and examined rates of surgery and age at surgery in an Australian population.

- **Methods**: UDT was identified from all live-born infants in New South Wales, Australia, from 2001 to 2011 using routinely collected record-linked birth and hospital data. The prevalence of UDT, surgery rates, age at surgery, postsurgical outcomes, and risk factors for surgery performed later than the recommended age were evaluated.

- **Results**: There were 10,875 (2.1%) boys with a recorded diagnosis of UDT. Corrective surgery was performed in 4,980 (45.8%), representing a cumulative prevalence of 9.6 per 1,000 male births. Five percent of surgeries were orchidectomies, and 9% of boys had revision surgery. The median age at surgery was 16.6 months (interquartile range 11.8 to 31.0 months), decreasing from 21 months for boys born in 2001 to 13 months for boys born in 2010. Among those boys having surgery before 36 months (n = 3,897), 67% had corrective surgery after the recommended 12 months of age; socioeconomic disadvantage, regional/remote area of residence, and lack of private health insurance were risk factors for having corrective surgery after 12 months.

- **Conclusions**: One in 50 boys born are diagnosed with UDT; two-thirds had no report of corrective surgery. The age at surgery is decreasing; however, two-thirds of surgeries are performed after 12 months.

### Adult care of children from pediatric urology: part 2 [^116HWKXZ]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

We describe the outcomes of undescended testes and sex development disorders in adolescence and young adulthood. We reviewed the requirements for the long-term care of children born with these and other major congenital anomalies of the genitourinary system.

The English language literature was retrieved with a PubMed® search for articles on these subjects. Only articles covering outcomes at ages past puberty were included in the analysis. The material was supplemented from the database of the clinic for adults with sex development disorders at University College London Hospitals.

An undescended testis has impaired spermatogenesis. In men in whom a unilateral undescended testis was corrected before puberty, the incidence of paternity is normal at around 90% of those who attempt it. The equivalent rate for those with bilateral undescended testes is about 65%. If surgery for bilateral undescended testes is delayed until after puberty, fertility is unlikely. The risk of testicular neoplasms is overestimated, and the relative risk is between 2.5 and 8.

Children born with a sex development disorder receive multidisciplinary treatment throughout childhood and require the same care as adults. Males who are undervirilized likely have a micropenis (greater than 2 SD below the mean stretched length), but they may have normal sexual function. Fertility depends on the underlying condition. Virilized females, who most commonly have congenital adrenal hyperplasia, currently present to adult clinics with an inadequate vagina after infantile surgery.
