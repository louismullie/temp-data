## Question

Lactobacillus in jrine culture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret Lactobacillus recovered from urine cultures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pre-test probability. Then, I should verify laboratory methods and detection limits. Next, I will consider colony counts and culture purity, correlate with inflammatory markers, assess host risk factors, and review antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. After that, I need to check guideline-aligned decision pathways, consider when to escalate diagnostics, and finally think through probiotic-related scenarios and a practical management algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because it governs whether Lactobacillus represents contamination, colonization, or true infection, and I should not jump to conclusions based on genus alone. Although Lactobacillus is a dominant component of healthy vaginal flora and often labeled a contaminant, case series and cohorts document true UTIs due to species like L. delbrueckii, particularly in vulnerable hosts, so I need to integrate symptoms, collection method, and risk factors before deciding to treat [^111wC1T4] [^1118d1Ag] [^114qGUjr]. I should double-check whether the urine was obtained for appropriate clinical indications, since guidelines advise against routine cultures in asymptomatic catheterized patients, which reduces detection of clinically irrelevant bacteriuria and overtreatment [^111FUXt3].

> Next, I should review the laboratory methodology and its inherent detection limitations, because standard protocols are biased toward abundant aerobes and can miss Lactobacillus. Standard 1 µL aerobic culture often fails to recover fastidious or low-abundance organisms, whereas EQUC with higher inoculum, multiple atmospheres, and prolonged incubation detects many additional taxa including Lactobacillus, so an apparently "no growth" report may be misleading in the right clinical context [^113iL4uM] [^117K4eHt]. Hold on, I should verify organism identification too, as MALDI-TOF improves species-level accuracy for Lactobacillus compared with phenotypic methods in this taxonomically complex genus, which affects susceptibility assumptions and clinical decisions [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui]. Let me also consider molecular assays and metagenomics, which can detect low-level Lactobacillus and broader urobiome communities, but I need to ensure clinical correlation because these methods can identify colonizers in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [^115x5w9L] [^112iVW93] [^111wC1T4]. Finally, I should confirm the collection technique, because catheterized specimens better reflect bladder microbiota than midstream voided samples, which are more prone to vulvovaginal contamination [^113ERa8g] [^111cMULo].

> I will now examine colony counts and culture purity, while reminding myself that universal thresholds are oversimplified and organism dependent. The classic ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL threshold does not fit all pathogens or hosts; symptomatic infections can occur at 10²–10⁴ CFU/mL, especially for fastidious organisms or when collected via catheter, so I should interpret counts in context rather than rigidly [^116jXsmr]. Hmm, wait a minute, midstream predictive performance varies by organism: very low counts of E. coli in midstream urine strongly predict bladder bacteriuria, but this predictiveness does not generalize to other gram-positive genera, so for Lactobacillus I should be more cautious and lean on the collection method and purity of growth [^113ERa8g]. A pure or predominant growth of Lactobacillus from a properly collected catheterized specimen in a symptomatic patient is more likely to be clinically meaningful than low-count mixed growth from a midstream sample, which should prompt recollection or enhanced culture rather than immediate therapy [^113iL4uM] [^113ERa8g].

> Let me correlate with inflammatory markers and host response because they strengthen or weaken the inference of pathogenicity. I should confirm whether there is pyuria or a positive direct exam, since in elderly cohorts with Lactobacillus UTIs, significant cultures were accompanied by positive microscopy in the vast majority, supporting infection over contamination [^114qGUjr]. But wait, absence of pyuria does not definitively exclude infection in immunocompromised hosts with blunted responses, so I need to interpret urinalysis alongside clinical status and risk [^notfound]. I need to check whether adjunctive markers of urothelial inflammation have been measured, as cytokine profiles can help differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from true infection in older adults, though these tools are not yet routine [^112TPQWG].

> Now I should assess risk factors that lower the threshold for calling Lactobacillus a uropathogen, and I must verify each one in the case at hand. Elderly women, patients with indwelling or long-term catheters, and those with neurogenic bladder or structural abnormalities are at higher risk for clinically significant Lactobacillus infections rather than mere colonization, so compatible symptoms in these groups deserve serious consideration and targeted workup [^114qGUjr]. Hold on, I should also ask about recent or ongoing probiotic exposure, which can seed transient bacteriuria without disease in most hosts, but rarely causes invasive infection in the severely immunocompromised, prompting strain-level evaluation if clinical suspicion is high [^113oX3Ed] [^115SBLLp]. Let me reconsider the baseline urogenital microbiome too, as Lactobacillus commonly inhabits the bladder in health, so detection alone, especially at low biomass in a midstream sample, may not equal disease without the clinical and inflammatory context to support it [^111cMULo] [^112LrA6W].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, but I need to confirm species-level identification because susceptibilities vary among Lactobacillus. Many Lactobacillus isolates are susceptible to beta-lactams, while intrinsic or common resistance to metronidazole, fosfomycin, aminoglycosides, and variably to vancomycin should be anticipated and verified with MIC testing when treatment is indicated, as empiric use of agents like fosfomycin would be expected to fail [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui]. I should double-check local resistance patterns and prior urine culture history if available, since prior organism identity and susceptibility can inform empiric coverage while awaiting definitive results, although data are stronger for typical uropathogens than for Lactobacillus [^111M2WqX].

> I will now align decisions with guidelines, but I must adapt them to the urobiome-era nuances and this organism. I should confirm that urine cultures are used appropriately: avoid routine cultures in asymptomatic catheterized patients, obtain cultures before antibiotics in suspected CA-UTI, and in scenarios such as suspected pyelonephritis, atypical presentations, persistent or recurrent symptoms, pregnancy, and treatment failures to guide therapy wisely and avoid overtreatment of ASB [^111FUXt3] [^112qTX31] [^117ARgks] [^116RajvE]. Hold on, let's not conflate BV management with urinary infection; metronidazole and clindamycin are for BV and do not target Lactobacillus in the bladder, so I should avoid applying BV regimens to a urinary Lactobacillus finding unless treating concomitant vaginal disease [^116ecoQF]. In practice, asymptomatic patients with Lactobacillus growth, even at high counts, generally represent ASB and should not be treated except in pregnancy or prior to urologic procedures, whereas symptomatic patients with supportive urinalysis and an appropriately collected specimen merit consideration of targeted therapy after confirmation, ideally with species ID and MICs [^112qTX31] [^116EoXQ4].

> If standard culture is discordant with the clinical picture, I need to consider advanced diagnostics thoughtfully. Let me first confirm that sampling and timing were optimal; if they were, I can escalate to EQUC to recover fastidious organisms missed by standard methods, or leverage urinary cfDNA or metagenomic approaches to broaden detection, while guarding against over-calling colonization as infection without supportive clinical and inflammatory evidence [^113iL4uM] [^117K4eHt] [^115HKeCK] [^112iVW93]. But wait, I should verify that any molecular result is interpreted with quantitative context when available, given that low-level signals are common in asymptomatic urine and that sequencing can detect shared urogenital commensals including Lactobacillus species, necessitating careful correlation and, when needed, confirmatory culture for susceptibility testing [^111wC1T4] [^115x5w9L] [^111cMULo].

> I will now examine probiotic-related bacteriuria scenarios, acknowledging their rarity as true infections but staying vigilant in high-risk hosts. Probiotic Lactobacillus exposure can can can lead to detection of related strains in urine; wait, let me correct that redundant phrasing: probiotic exposure can lead to transient bacteriuria, which is usually benign, but in severely immunocompromised or device-bearing patients I should confirm species or strain identity and clinical significance before deciding on therapy or discontinuing the probiotic [^113oX3Ed] [^115SBLLp]. I need to ensure that if a true Lactobacillus UTI is diagnosed in this context, therapy reflects the organism's intrinsic resistance profile and host factors, ideally with MIC guidance rather than empiric agents with predictable inactivity like metronidazole or fosfomycin [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while I double-check that each step is supported by data. If Lactobacillus grows from a midstream specimen in a minimally symptomatic patient, I should repeat testing with a catheterized specimen, assess urinalysis for pyuria, and consider EQUC or molecular testing only if symptoms persist and standard culture is unrevealing, avoiding reflex antibiotics for likely ASB or contamination [^113ERa8g] [^113iL4uM] [^116EoXQ4]. If a symptomatic patient has pure or predominant Lactobacillus in a catheterized specimen with pyuria, I should treat as a probable UTI using a beta-lactam guided by MICs, avoid agents with intrinsic resistance, address modifiable risk factors such as catheter management, and arrange follow-up for clinical response, escalating diagnostics if treatment fails or if complicated infection is suspected [^114qGUjr] [^112qTX31] [^117ARgks] [^1116zCui]. Throughout, I need to ensure adherence to guideline indications for culture and antibiotics to minimize overtreatment and resistance, while remaining open to emerging evidence about the urinary microbiome that refines organism-specific interpretation in context [^111FUXt3] [^116RajvE] [^112iVW93].

Lactobacillus in urine culture is usually a commensal finding [^112LrA6W] from the normal female urogenital microbiota [^113iL4uM] [^11783UYm] and is not considered pathogenic in asymptomatic patients [^116EoXQ4]. It is most often a contaminant from vaginal or perineal flora during collection, especially in midstream samples [^113ERa8g]. Only in rare cases — typically in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^114qGUjr] with significant pyuria and high colony counts — should Lactobacillus be considered a potential pathogen [^1118d1Ag]. Routine antibiotic treatment is not indicated unless there are clear clinical signs of infection [^116EoXQ4]; if treatment is needed, beta-lactams are preferred [^114qGUjr], as Lactobacillus is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin and metronidazole.

---

## Clinical significance of lactobacillus in urine culture

Lactobacillus species are **commensal bacteria** commonly found in the female urogenital tract [^112LrA6W], including the vagina [^11783UYm] and bladder [^113iL4uM] [^115DFXjV]. Their presence in urine cultures is typically a normal finding that reflects the natural urinary microbiota [^112ci2BM]. Lactobacillus species play a protective role [^112LrA6W] by maintaining an acidic environment and producing lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins [^113uZ5Xh] that inhibit pathogenic bacteria [^1158yQ2V].

---

## Differentiating contamination from true infection

The presence of Lactobacillus in urine cultures is most often due to **contamination** from vaginal or perineal flora during collection, particularly with midstream urine samples [^113ERa8g]. True infections caused by Lactobacillus are rare [^1118d1Ag] and typically occur in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions [^114qGUjr]. Criteria to differentiate contamination from true infection include:

- **Clinical symptoms**: Presence of urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, or fever.

- **Colony count**: Significant bacteriuria (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with pyuria suggests true infection [^1159m6Lp].

- **Patient population**: Immunocompromised or elderly patients are more likely to have true infections [^114qGUjr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **clinical context** [^117ARgks] when interpreting Lactobacillus-positive urine cultures. Routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic bacteriuria [^116EoXQ4] or when Lactobacillus is identified as a contaminant. Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for symptomatic patients or those at high risk of complications [^1118d1Ag], such as immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women [^117ARgks] [^114qGUjr].

---

## Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns

Lactobacillus species are generally susceptible to **beta-lactam antibiotics**, such as penicillin and ampicillin [^1116zCui]. However, they are **intrinsically resistant** to fosfomycin [^114qGUjr] and metronidazole [^1116zCui]. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended when Lactobacillus is isolated from symptomatic patients or those at high risk of complications [^1116zCui].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

The presence of Lactobacillus in urine cultures has **important clinical implications**:

- **Protective role**: Lactobacillus species help maintain urinary tract health by inhibiting pathogenic bacteria [^113uZ5Xh].

- **Contamination**: Most positive cultures reflect contamination rather than true infection [^113ERa8g].

- **Rare infections**: True infections are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^1118d1Ag].

For management, **no treatment** is appropriate for asymptomatic patients or when contamination is suspected [^116EoXQ4], whereas **antibiotic therapy** should be used for symptomatic or high-risk patients, guided by susceptibility testing [^117ARgks].

---

## Conclusion

In urine cultures, Lactobacillus is **usually a nonpathogenic commensal or contaminant** [^113iL4uM], therefore **no antibiotics are indicated in asymptomatic patients** [^116EoXQ4]. Consider targeted therapy only when there are clear urinary symptoms with objective evidence of infection (e.g. pyuria, high colony counts) [^1159m6Lp] or in high-risk hosts.

### Lactobacillus delbrueckii as the cause of urinary tract infection [^1118d1Ag]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli are part of the normal bacterial flora of the vagina and are typically considered contaminants when cultured from urine specimens of female patients. Here, we describe the case of a female patient with chronic pyuria and urinary tract symptoms in which Lactobacillus delbrueckii was determined to be the causative microorganism.

### Subspecies and as emerging human uropathogens in elderly patients [^114qGUjr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been considered a very rare cause of human urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, little is known about its clinical significance and antimicrobial susceptibility, and genomic data from clinical isolates are lacking. This study aimed to analyze clinical, microbiological, and genomic data of L. delbrueckii urinary isolates.

All L. delbrueckii isolates collected from patients hospitalized in a French university hospital from 2014 to 2016 were included. Clinical and biological data were gathered. Species identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted using Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 bp, and genomes were compared using three approaches: multilocus sequence typing (MLST), average nucleotide identity (ANI), and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

From 2014 to 2016, 48 isolates of L. delbrueckii were recovered from the urine of 48 patients (mean age = 84 years; sex ratio M/F = 0.04). Nearly half (44%) of patients were diagnosed with a UTI, and all had significant cultures (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with a positive direct examination in over 90% of cases. The majority of isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics, especially β-lactams, whereas they seemed intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin and metronidazole. Subspecies identification was consistent across the three approaches, showing that most L. delbrueckii isolates belonged to subspecies allosunkii.

### The vaginal microbiome: III. The vaginal microbiome in various urogenital disorders [^112LrA6W]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The study of urinary microbial communities traditionally focused on standard urine cultures. These methods, however, had significant limitations in detecting the full spectrum of urinary bacterial species, primarily due to unculturable (fastidious) microorganisms and the absence of mucosal organism representation in urine specimens. Advances in microbiome characterization using 16S rRNA sequencing and enhanced or expanded quantitative urine culture have accelerated progress in urinary microbiome (UMB) research.

The human bladder, long considered a sterile organ, has been recently identified as a site of permanent microbial colonization. These findings prompt new questions: What roles do microbes colonizing the bladder play in urinary tract syndromes and infections? Are they causes or effects of these conditions?

There has been substantial heterogeneity in study design and methodology, leaving important knowledge gaps in understanding the UMB-VMB relationship. Reported variability in periurethral microbiota may result from inconsistent specimen collection techniques, contamination from the vulva/vagina, sexual activity, menstruation, and recent use of hygiene products.

- **Urinary microbiome in urinary disorders**: Lactobacillus and Streptococcus are the most frequently reported colonizing microbes in the UMB. Both genera are lactic acid–producing bacteria, providing a protective role against pathogens. Other UMB bacteria occur less frequently.

### Urine is not sterile: Use of enhanced urine culture techniques to detect resident bacterial flora in the adult female bladder [^113iL4uM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16S rRNA sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol.

Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10³ CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%), Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum.

Our study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^111cMULo]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Metagenomic analyses have indicated that the female bladder harbors an indigenous microbiota. However, there are few cultured reference strains with sequenced genomes available for functional and experimental analyses. Here, we isolate and genome-sequence 149 bacterial strains from catheterized urine of 77 women. This culture collection spans 78 species, representing approximately two-thirds of the bacterial diversity within the sampled bladders, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes.

Detailed genomic and functional comparison of the bladder microbiota to the gastrointestinal and vaginal microbiotas demonstrates similar vaginal and bladder microbiota, with functional capacities that are distinct from those observed in the gastrointestinal microbiota. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of bacterial strains isolated from the vagina and bladder in the same women identifies highly similar *Escherichia coli*, *Streptococcus anginosus*, *Lactobacillus iners*, and *Lactobacillus crispatus*, suggesting an interlinked female urogenital microbiota that is not only limited to pathogens but is also characteristic of health-associated commensals.

### A comparison of the performance of commercially available chromogenic agars for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine [^113DWfKB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare four media — UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, CPS ID2, and Harlequin CLED — using a collection of fully characterized organisms and through subsequent "field trials".

Methods involved testing 787 fully characterized isolates, comprising 730 Gram-negative bacteria, 47 Gram-positive bacteria, and 10 yeasts, to evaluate the accuracy of organism identification. To assess isolation rates and the ability to detect mixed cultures, 1,435 urine samples were cultured in the three best performing chromogenic media (UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, and CPS ID2) and CLED.

Results showed that the chromogenic agars varied in their accuracy of identification, with BBL CHROMagar performing best and Harlequin CLED performing least well. BBL CHROMagar also achieved a higher overall isolation rate than UTI medium and CPS ID2. When mixed growth was defined as greater than two organism types, BBL CHROMagar detected more mixed cultures than UTI medium and CPS ID2, although the differences were not significant. However, when mixed growth was defined as greater than one organism type, the increase in mixed growths detected by BBL CHROMagar became significant, largely due to differences in enterococcal isolation rates.

The conclusion suggested that using BBL CHROMagar, UTI medium, or CPS ID2 chromogenic agar as a replacement for CLED agar would improve the detection rate of contaminated urine samples. Enhanced identification can help distinguish different species, facilitating the monitoring of bacterial resistance to support the national antibiotic strategy. BBL CHROMagar demonstrated the highest overall organism recovery.

### Perspectives from the Society for Pediatric Research: Probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^1152LL59]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

In the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association's clinical practice guidelines on the use of probiotics, they do not comment on the use of probiotics for the prevention of non-C. difficile colitis. However, the authors offer a conditional recommendation, based on low-quality evidence, to use probiotics to prevent C. difficile colitis in children on antibiotics.

Much like the prior two conditions discussed, the significant heterogeneity in the literature on the use of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is problematic when making recommendations regarding their use. There are also additional clinical considerations regarding the clinical use of probiotics for AAD. First, most patients may need to pay for probiotics "out of pocket", which may present a financial burden. This concern is an important balancing measure to consider when deciding to initiate probiotics for the prevention of AAD, especially since not every child given antibiotics will develop AAD. Overall, the number needed to treat to prevent AAD is approximately 11. While this is a reasonable number needed to treat, it is an important consideration when weighing the decision to prescribe probiotics for a patient for whom the cost of probiotics is prohibitive. Additionally, while probiotics are generally safe and well-tolerated, there is the possibility that the increased complexity of the medication regimen may affect patient adherence with the antibiotic therapy. Indeed, the number of doses of medications has been demonstrated to be a factor in patient non-adherence with medication regimens.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^111FUXt3]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for catheter-associated urinary tract infections, more specifically with respect to urine culture, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine urine cultures in asymptomatic catheterized patients.

### Cervicovaginal bacteria are a major modulator of host inflammatory responses in the female genital tract [^1158yQ2V]. Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Colonization by Lactobacillus in the female genital tract is thought to be critical for maintaining genital health. However, little is known about how genital microbiota influence host immune function and modulate disease susceptibility. We studied a cohort of asymptomatic young South African women and found that the majority of participants had genital communities with low Lactobacillus abundance and high ecological diversity. High-diversity communities strongly correlated with genital pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Transcriptional profiling suggested that genital antigen-presenting cells sense gram-negative bacterial products in situ via Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, contributing to genital inflammation through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and recruitment of lymphocytes by chemokine production. Our study proposes a mechanism by which cervicovaginal microbiota impact genital inflammation and thereby might affect a woman's reproductive health, including her risk of acquiring HIV.

### Utilization of the intestinal tract as a delivery system for urogenital probiotics [^111B5xvB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Orally consumed viable bacteria with proposed beneficial health effects, known as probiotics, are increasingly used to treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been recently suggested that specifically selected lactobacilli could have a therapeutic role in female urogenital tract infections. It has also been proposed that some of these bacteria could be delivered orally, rather than intravaginally. The authors investigate the ability of lactobacilli isolated from the vagina to survive gastrointestinal tract transit and establish a link between the rate of intestinal survival and vaginal colonization.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^116jXsmr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, making the use of universal thresholds to define infection, such as ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10² CFU/mL. These levels are not only below the detection limit of a standard 1 µL inoculum but also overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control the variable quality of specimen collection. Additionally, traditional cultures cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a urinary tract infection from colonization or asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB).

### Predictive utility of prior positive urine cultures [^111M2WqX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A patient's prior urine cultures are often considered when choosing empiric antibiotic therapy for a suspected urinary tract infection. We sought to evaluate how well previous urine cultures predict the identity and susceptibility of organisms in a patient's subsequent urine cultures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multinational, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, including 22,019 pairs of positive urine cultures from 4,351 patients across two healthcare systems in Toronto, Ontario, and Chicago, Illinois. We examined the probability of the same organism being identified from the same patient's positive urine culture as a function of time elapsed from the previous positive urine specimen. In cases where the same organism was identified, we also examined the likelihood of the organism exhibiting the same or better antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

- **Results**: At 4–8 weeks between cultures, the correspondence in isolate identity was 57% (95% confidence interval, 55%-59%), and at more than 32 weeks, it was 49% (95% CI, 48%-50%), still greater than expected by chance (P < .001). Despite high local rates of ciprofloxacin resistance in urine isolates across all patients (40%; 95% CI, 39.5%-40.5%), ciprofloxacin resistance was less than 20% among patients with a prior ciprofloxacin-sensitive organism and no subsequent fluoroquinolone exposure.

- **Conclusions**: A patient's prior urine culture results are predictive of future culture results, especially in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy selection.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^111wC1T4]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Our sampling protocol captured vaginal swabs taken in parallel to each urinary test for 20 of our asymptomatic donors, enabling us to co-profile asymptomatic vaginal biota (see Fig. 3). Estimated cell values for each species identified at > 10,000 bacterial cells per swab are provided for each sample, allowing estimates of the total number of cells recovered per swab (ranging from 64,000 to 240,000,000 cells per swab, with a median of 14,600,000 cells per swab). Consistent with the urine samples, the number of bacterial cells recovered for each vaginal swab varied considerably, some of which is likely due to variation in individual donor swabbing technique. On average, 10 discrete organisms (ranging from 1 to 35, with a median of 6) were identified per sample, equating to alpha diversity measures from 0 to 2.4, with a median of 0.8 (as shown in Fig. 3). Across the cohort, 64 different species were identified, with 50% also observed in the urine samples. As in the urine samples, Lactobacillus crispatus was the most prevalent organism, found in 50% of the vaginal swab samples. Notably, 24 species were unique to single donor samples.

- **Comparison of vaginal swab profiles**: From the 20 healthy control female donors, values are given as predicted cells per swab per organism detected. Similar to urine samples (Fig. 2), samples cluster into four major microbiomes, dominated by Gardnerella spp. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, or Lactobacillus jensenii.

Evidence of discrete vaginal microbiomes dominated by the same species identified in the urine analysis; Gardnerella spp. and Lactobacillus iners.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: The most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^112TPQWG]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

While the identification of risk factors helps clinicians to better assess the potential need for treatment, there is still an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) and urinary tract infections (UTI), especially in the geriatric population. This challenge could be overcome by improving the diagnosis of the inflammatory state of the urinary tract mucosa. Analysis of inflammation marker cytokine levels in urine has shown promise in distinguishing ABU from upper urinary tract infections.

Alternatively, the risk of severe infection and the need for treatment could be predicted based on bacterial determinants. Several virulence factors in E. coli have been shown to be associated with pyelonephritis. Given the recent advances in molecular diagnostics, a rapid molecular diagnostic test detecting the presence of E. coli and its pathogenicity potential could aid in deciding whether to administer antibiotics. After such treatment, the administration of avirulent ABU strains in a probiotic-like manner might reduce the risk of reinfection with the virulent strain and could prove superior to administering antibiotics alone.

### Bacteraemia caused by Lactobacillus casei in a patient after cardiac surgery. A case report [^115SBLLp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Lactobacillus spp. are lactic acid bacteria common in the environment, including water, domestic sewage, plants, and human and animal organisms. In humans, they are a natural component of the bacterial flora in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary system. These bacteria have beneficial effects on the functioning of the human body and are part of everyday functional foods.

Owing to their natural ability to produce lactic acid, they lower the pH of the environment in which they thrive. The industry uses this feature to make fermented milk, yoghurt, cheese, and pharmaceuticals, including probiotics. Lactic acid bacilli are commonly known as probiotic bacteria and belong to "good" bacteria, which play a pro-health role in the body.

We did not consider Lactobacillus to be significantly pathogenic; however, it may cause severe infections in patients with immune system dysfunctions. Cases of endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, prostatic joint infection, urinary tract infections, abscesses, or bacteraemia caused by Lactobacillus bacteria have been described.

### The clinical urine culture: Enhanced techniques improve detection of clinically relevant microorganisms [^117K4eHt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC) detects live microorganisms in the vast majority of urine specimens reported as "no growth" by the standard urine culture protocol. Here, we evaluated an expanded set of EQUC conditions (expanded-spectrum EQUC) to identify an optimal version that provides a more complete description of uropathogens in women experiencing urinary tract infection (UTI)-like symptoms.

One hundred fifty adult urogynecology patient participants were characterized using a self-completed validated UTI symptom assessment (UTISA) questionnaire and asked, "Do you feel you have a UTI?" Women responding negatively were recruited into the no-UTI cohort, while women responding affirmatively were recruited into the UTI cohort; the latter cohort was reassessed with the UTISA questionnaire 3 to 7 days later.

Baseline catheterized urine samples were plated using both standard urine culture and expanded-spectrum EQUC protocols: standard urine culture inoculated at 1 μl onto 2 agars incubated aerobically; expanded-spectrum EQUC inoculated at three different volumes of urine onto 7 combinations of agars and environments. Compared to expanded-spectrum EQUC, standard urine culture missed 67% of uropathogens overall and 50% in participants with severe urinary symptoms. Thirty-six percent of participants with missed uropathogens reported no symptom resolution after treatment by standard urine culture results. Optimal detection of uropathogens could be achieved using the following: 100 μl of urine plated onto blood (blood agar plate [BAP]), colistin-nalidixic acid (CNA), and…

### Molecular identification of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis [^11783UYm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects millions of women and is associated with several serious health conditions. Despite numerous studies based on cultures, the cause of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood. Bacteria in microbial communities can be identified without cultivation by characterizing their ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences.

- **Methods**: We identified bacteria in samples of vaginal fluid using a combination of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S rDNA with clone analysis, bacterium-specific PCR assay of 16S rDNA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed directly on vaginal fluid from 27 subjects with bacterial vaginosis and 46 without the condition. Twenty-one subjects were studied with the use of broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and 73 subjects were studied using bacterium-specific PCR.

- **Results**: Women without bacterial vaginosis had 1 to 6 vaginal bacterial species (phylotypes) in each sample (mean, 3.3), as detected by broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, with lactobacillus species being the predominant bacteria noted (83 to 100 percent of clones). In contrast, women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity (P < 0.001), with 9 to 17 phylotypes (mean, 12.6) detected per sample. Newly recognized species were present in 32 to 89 percent of clones per sample library (mean, 58 percent). Thirty-five unique bacterial species, including several species with no close cultivated relatives, were detected in the women with bacterial vaginosis. Bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that several bacteria had not been previously identified.

### Connecting the dots: Translating the vaginal microbiome into a drug [^1141G2od]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

A Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota (VMB) has been associated with health and is considered an important host defense mechanism against urogenital infections. Conversely, the depletion of lactobacilli and increased microbial diversity amplify the risk of adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes. A common clinical condition that exemplifies dysbiosis is bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is currently treated with antibiotics, but it frequently recurs, due in part to persistent dysbiosis and the failure of lactobacilli to repopulate the vagina. New treatment options are needed to address BV.

The VMB is relatively simple and is optimally dominated by one or several species of Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus crispatus is strongly associated with vaginal health and is depleted in dysbiosis. Replenishing the dysbiotic VMB with protective L. crispatus CTV-05 is a promising approach to prevent reinfections and improve women's health. Here we discuss the confirmation of this approach with the microbiome-based biologic drug, LACTIN-V (L. crispatus CTV-05), focusing on the prevention of BV recurrence.

### Evaluation of the BacterioScan 216Dx for standalone preculture screen of preserved urine specimens in a clinical setting [^113dDzit]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The BacterioScan 216Dx laser microbial growth monitoring system was evaluated as an option for preurine culture screening of preserved urine specimens at an acute care medical center.

- **Methods**: The BacterioScan 216Dx system's performance characteristics and economic impact (cost-effectiveness) for the laboratory were assessed. Urinalysis performance compared with urine culture was evaluated if urinalysis was ordered as part of the patient care set.

- **Results**: When compared to urine culture, the BacterioScan exhibited overall performance with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of 76% (68–83) sensitivity, 84% (80–87) specificity, 55% (48–63) positive predictive value, and 93% (90–95) negative predictive value for 610 randomly selected preserved urine specimens. Urinalysis compared to urine culture showed an overall performance of 59% (48–69) sensitivity, 87% (83–90) specificity, 53% (43–63) positive predictive value, and 89% (86–92) negative predictive value for 414 urine specimens.

- **Conclusions**: While the system improved turnaround time to a negative report, adopting the BacterioScan system would increase the reagent budget for laboratory urine culture by 2.34 times the cost, potentially making BacterioScan prohibitive in a budget-restricted environment. Additionally, its performance compared to traditional urine culture was less than acceptable for a diagnostic laboratory to use as a stand-alone urinary tract infection screen.

### Cervicovaginal microbial features predict spread to the upper genital tract of infected women [^113TdP8Q]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

In contrast, lactic acid produced by Lactobacillus sp. directly kills CT, while D(−) lactic acid produced by some Lactobacillus sp. inhibits CT infection by down-regulating host epithelial cell proliferation. In this study, we were unable to detect associations of the most abundant Lactobacillus species with CT positivity but identified differences in low-abundance strains. We questioned whether the low-abundant Lactobacillus ASVs that were differentially abundant by MaAsLin2 analysis were genuine Lactobacillus species or accidental assignments of artificial sequences to Lactobacillus species, given the taxonomic complexity among Lactobacillus species and the limitations of characterizing these species through the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although ASVs have intrinsic biological meaning independent of reference databases or the specific context of a study, the taxonomic resolution is much lower compared to the full length of 16S rRNA sequences or metagenome sequences.

Recent genomic studies identify genetic elements that control functional differences between and within Lactobacillus species. These include the role of bile salt hydrolases that promote colonization of vertebrate-adapted niches and the ability to metabolize extracellular glycogen important for microbial growth in the female genital tract. Additionally, the identification of novel urogenital tract species suggests that it is premature to conclude that the differences we detected between CT-infected and -uninfected women are artifactual. Future investigations should consider implementing typing approaches.

### Standardization of microbiome studies for urolithiasis: An international consensus agreement [^111xGCHX]. Nature Reviews Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Metaculturomics is a critical approach recommended by the consortium for cross-validating sequencing results. It ensures that detected bacteria originate from the stones rather than surrounding urine and isolates bacteria for mechanistic studies. An expanded quantitative urine culture protocol has been developed for both urine and stone samples, while other culturomic approaches have been designed for stool samples.

- **Urine and stone samples**: For the expanded quantitative urine culture protocol, large volumes of sample (10 µl and 100 µl) are plated onto various media, such as blood agar, chocolate agar, colistin and nalidixic acid agar, and CDC anaerobe blood agar. These plates are incubated under multiple atmospheric conditions (aerobic, anaerobic, 5% CO₂) for 48 hours. The minimum detection threshold is 10–100 colony-forming units per milliliter.

- **Stool samples**: These samples exhibit greater taxonomic and metabolic diversity compared to urine and stone samples, necessitating a wider variety of conditions to adequately capture this diversity. The most successful culture conditions for capturing broad diversity include aerobic and anaerobic culturing in blood agar with or without rumen fluid, marine broth, or trypticase soy broth.

Preincubation of stool or urine samples in broth, using the defined conditions, frequently increases the diversity of bacteria isolated. This process puts all bacteria in the sample into an active metabolic state, enhancing detection. Notably, specific taxa or metabolic functions can be targeted by utilizing specialized media types and/or conditions.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections [^112aVJk8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the healthcare economy. By definition, rUTIs are considered recurring if there are more than two in a 6-month period or three in one year. Recurrent urinary tract infections not only impair quality of life for patients, but they also have significant economic consequences. In 2003, the estimated healthcare cost of UTIs annually was USD $1.6 billion, and the healthcare burden is certainly higher two decades later. The cost of an acute UTI workup ranges from USD $390 to USD $730, not including the price of antibiotic treatment.

Women are often given multiple rounds of antibiotics between primary care physicians and specialists to treat infections. Consequently, these patients often seek non-antibiotic alternatives, such as vaginal probiotics and supplements, as these have gained significant attention in mainstream media and the lay press. There is an increasing body of literature supporting the use of vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories to reduce candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis infections; however, the role of vaginal probiotics for the prevention of rUTIs is less clear. Increasing data suggest that the vaginal microbiome varies between individuals who are susceptible to urinary infections. As such, it stands to reason that a vaginal probiotic would be more effective in preventing rUTIs.

The objective of this study was to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for women suffering from rUTIs.

### The human urinary microbiome and how it relates to urogynecology [^115YfQTj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies applying molecular techniques have demonstrated the presence of a urinary microbiota not detected by standard microbiological techniques. These have been found in the urine of healthy individuals and in those suffering from clinical symptoms. The present article reviews the findings of these studies at the time of writing, describing the molecular techniques and specifically outlining any differences in microbiomes in relation to urogynecological disease. Furthermore, the role of commensal bacteria in the lower urinary tract is considered.

- **Methods**: An extensive literature search was conducted to identify articles on the microbiome of the female urinary tract in health and disease. We searched the electronic meta-databases Ovid MEDLINE® 1946–2015 and Embase 1974–2015. The keywords "microbiome, microbiota, bacterial colonization, microbiology, commensal bacteria, and bacteriuria" were searched in combination with "lower urinary tract symptoms, urogenital symptoms, urinary tract infection, overactive bladder and urinary incontinence". A total of 426 papers were retrieved; 33 were included in this paper.

- **Results**: The microbiome of the female lower urinary tract shows variance between individuals and between age groups. There are significant differences between the microbiota in the lower urinary tract of individuals with urological symptoms and those without, relating to type and proportion of commensal Lactobacillus spp. There is only weak evidence to suggest that Lactobacillus might be applied as a therapeutic measure.

- **Conclusions**: It is still unclear.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^112iVW93]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Challenges do arise, however, around the possibility of applying metagenomic techniques to routine practice. In addition to potential uropathogens, these approaches identify a diversity of nonpathogenic commensals, greatly complicating reporting and interpretation on a case-by-case basis. From the perspective of the urobiome, low-level ASB may be viewed as a physiologic norm instead of an outlying phenomenon, and "No Growth Observed" should no longer be considered a universal reference value.

Complicating matters further, many of the species now viewed as emerging uropathogens can be detected in both subjects with and without UTI symptoms. Important avenues of research have emerged around the human urobiome, including how its population structure differs between individuals, evolves over time, and impacts other urologic conditions. In this light, the presence or abundance of certain species may be variably associated with clinical symptomatology, as modified by host factors and other commensals. This "pathobiome" view of the urinary tract is far more nuanced than the traditional binary relationship between organism and disease (i.e. presence = infection, absence = health).

While standardized methods for urobiome characterization have been proposed, these techniques have not supplanted traditional cultures within most clinical laboratories. As with other areas of the microbiome, outstanding questions remain on how urobiome data can be leveraged in a manner that is both evidence-based and in the context of personalized care.

### Probiotics (LGG-BB12 or RC14-GR1) versus placebo as prophylaxis for urinary tract infection in persons with spinal cord injury (ProSCIUTTU): a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^115B8Kq6]. BMC Urology (2016). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). UTIs are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to treat as the organisms that cause them become more antibiotic-resistant. Among the SCI population, there is a high rate of multi-resistant organism (MRO) colonization. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies are needed to prevent UTI without increasing resistance. Probiotics have been reported to be beneficial in preventing UTIs in post-menopausal women in several in vivo and in vitro studies. The main aim of this study is to determine whether probiotic therapy with combinations of Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 + Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 (RC14-GR1) and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG + Bifidobacterium BB-12 (LGG-BB12) are effective in preventing UTI in people with SCI compared to placebo.

- **Method**: This is a multi-site randomised double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled factorial design study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. All participants have a neurogenic bladder as a result of spinal injury. Recruitment started in April 2011. Participants are randomised to one of four arms, designed for factorial analysis of LGG-BB12 and/or RC14-GR1 versus placebo. This involves 24 weeks of daily oral treatment with RC14-GR1 + LGG-BB12, RC14-GR1 + placebo, LGG-BB12 + placebo, or two placebo capsules. Randomisation is stratified by bladder management type and inpatient status. Participants are assessed at baseline, three months, and six months for Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), microbiological swabs of rectum, nose, and groin; and urine culture.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115QLQn2]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional bacterial culture, bacterial identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Ninety of the 141 samples in the study had a corresponding same day urine culture. Each of these clean-catch midstream culture urine samples was inoculated onto tryptic soy agar with sheep blood (Becton, Dickinson and Company [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) and MacConkey agar (BD) using a 1-μL inoculation loop and incubated in ambient air at 35 °C. Four urine samples were reported as mixed bacterial flora and were excluded because of lack of further identification. Eighty-six samples were defined as either negative urine culture (n = 43) or positive urine culture (n = 43) for the cfDNA/bacterial correlation analyses and ROC analyses.

A positive urine culture was defined as one growing an organism identified to at least the genus level (almost all bacterial isolates were recovered at a colony count ≥ 10,000 cfu/mL, while three isolates were recovered at a colony count < 10,000 cfu/mL). A urine culture was defined as negative when either no organism was isolated in culture (35 cultures, < 1000 cfu/mL) or the organism was unidentified to either the genus or species level and the colony count was < 10,000 cfu/mL (8 cultures).

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^1163pdPD]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

A growing body of work using catheterized urine in women has found associations between bladder microbiota composition and urgency urinary symptoms, response to anticholinergic medication, risk of postoperative and post-instrumentation UTIs, and kidney stones. Here we provide an extensive, genome-sequenced culture collection representing approximately two-thirds of bacterial strains detected in the sampled female bladders during both health and disease. Direct cultivation paired with whole-genome sequencing offers the ability to move beyond broad phylogenetic relatedness to perform strain-level tracking and functional analysis of these microbes and communities. The creation of this comprehensive reference collection, capturing the complete phylogenetic diversity currently cultivated from the bladder, represents a valuable resource to explore the function of both pathogenic and commensal bladder bacteria.

We have demonstrated for the first time that, like some pathogens, highly similar strains of health-associated commensal bacteria are found in both the bladder and vagina of the same individual. Previously, it was thought that a healthy vaginal microbiota was the major factor in preventing ascending infections from migrating into a sterile bladder. The data presented herein suggest that microbial sharing between the vaginal and bladder microbiota is not limited to known and emerging uropathogens, such as E. coli and S. anginosus, but also includes health-associated commensal bacteria, such as L. iners and L. crispatus.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^115x5w9L]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

We applied our technique to profile microbiomes in urine samples from self-reported asymptomatic control female donors (Fig. 2). Initially, we conducted single time-point analysis of samples taken from 23 adult female volunteers (average age 31 years; median 24 years; range 18–53 years). The total estimated biomass recovered for each urine sample varied considerably (range 13,000 to 15,000,000 cells/mL, median 1,400,000 cells/mL), representing 10× to 100× greater values than those previously estimated using 16S rRNA methods. Microbiome alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index, H) varied from 0 to 2.5 (median 0.76), equating to between 1 and 39 (median 7) discrete organisms per sample. No obvious correlation was found between the diversity of organisms detected and total sample biomass (data not shown).

Seventy-six different species were identified across the 23-sample cohort at levels greater than 1,000 cells/mL. Lactobacillus crispatus and Gardnerella vaginalis were the most prevalent organisms, present in 52% and 49% of the samples, respectively. Thirty-six species were unique to single samples.

- **Comparison of urinary profiles**: Urine samples from 23 healthy control female donors were analyzed. Predicted values for cells/mL urine/organism detected are given. Samples clustered into four major urobiomes dominated by Gardnerella spp. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, or Lactobacillus jensenii.

Our data confirm the existence of discrete urotypes paralleling previously reported vaginal community state types, or CSTs, predominated by Lactobacillus crispatus (CST:I).

### Randomised trial of cranberry-lingonberry juice and Lactobacillus GG drink for the prevention of urinary tract infections in women [^115P1PLC]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether recurrences of urinary tract infection can be prevented with cranberry-lingonberry juice or with Lactobacillus GG drink, this study was conducted as an open, randomised controlled 12-month follow-up trial. It was set in health centres for university students and staff of a university hospital.

The participants comprised 150 women with urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, randomly allocated into three groups. The interventions included 50 mL of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for six months, 100 mL of Lactobacillus drink five days a week for one year, or no intervention.

The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infection, defined as bacterial growth ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/ml in a clean voided midstream urine specimen. Results indicated that the cumulative rate of first recurrence of urinary tract infection during the 12-month follow-up differed significantly between the groups (P = 0.048). At six months, eight (16%) women in the cranberry group, 19 (39%) in the Lactobacillus group, and 18 (36%) in the control group had experienced at least one recurrence. This constituted a 20% reduction in absolute risk in the cranberry group compared with the control group (95% confidence interval 3% to 36%, P = 0.023, number needed to treat = 5, 95% confidence interval 3 to 34).

Regular consumption of cranberry juice, but not Lactobacillus, appears to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infection.

### Comparative molecular and microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis [^113KqvJf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

If species, as opposed to genus identification, may have only modest consequences on the management of most patients, for some cases the consequences can be substantial. Here, the identification of Lactobacillus crispatus, instead of S. agalactiae, led to the search and treatment of the dental portal of entry and the identification of Abiotrophia adiacens, instead of group C streptococci; thus in this last case, the antimicrobial drug treatment was prolonged. In five of six cases of negative blood culture, PCR permitted the identification of the responsible microorganism. The identification of S. gallolyticus in one patient led to the search for and removal of a precancerous intestinal polyp. In four cases, Bartonella species were identified and the antimicrobial drug regimens modified with the introduction of gentamicin and prolonged treatment. 16S rDNA PCR is of particular diagnostic value when serology has not been performed and when a serologic test is not available (as in the case of Tropheryma whippleii). Moreover, we believe that PCR on resected valves should be performed in patients with positive blood cultures, under two conditions: 1) in the absence of species identifications; or 2) if there is a lack of correlation between the putative microbial identification by conventional microbiologic techniques and the clinical signs and symptoms or course of the endocarditis.

### Voided midstream urine culture and acute cystitis in premenopausal women [^113ERa8g]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is determined on the basis of cultures of voided midstream urine, but few data guide the interpretation of such results, especially when gram-positive bacteria grow.

- **Methods**: Women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). We compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. The primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference.

- **Results**: The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 10² colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93% (Spearman's r = 0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r = 0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, the details regarding the predictiveness of these bacteria were not further specified.

### Adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^115qiFpn]. Microbes and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human-specific pathogenic bacterium that colonizes the urogenital tract, where it causes gonorrhea. In this study, we analyzed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. We show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate with the level of protection against gonococcal infection. Protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. Lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached to the host cell during gonococcal adherence.

Further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other, with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. Hence, gonococci bind to colonized lactobacilli, and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting in reduced bacterial colonization. Also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. Taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^115DFXjV]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Metagenomic analyses have indicated that the female bladder harbors an indigenous microbiota. However, there are few cultured reference strains with sequenced genomes available for functional and experimental analyses. Here, we isolate and genome-sequence 149 bacterial strains from catheterized urine of 77 women. This culture collection spans 78 species, representing approximately two-thirds of the bacterial diversity within the sampled bladders, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes.

Detailed genomic and functional comparison of the bladder microbiota to the gastrointestinal and vaginal microbiotas demonstrates similar vaginal and bladder microbiota, with functional capacities that are distinct from those observed in the gastrointestinal microbiota. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of bacterial strains isolated from the vagina and bladder in the same women identifies highly similar Escherichia coli, Streptococcus anginosus, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus crispatus. This suggests an interlinked female urogenital microbiota that is not only limited to pathogens but is also characteristic of health-associated commensals.

### Safety of probiotics that contain lactobacilli or bifidobacteria [^113oX3Ed]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are extremely rare causes of infection in humans, as are probiotics based on these organisms. This lack of pathogenicity extends across all age groups and to immunocompromised individuals. Strains used for new probiotics should be chosen from the commensal flora of humans and should not carry intrinsic resistance to antibiotics that would prevent treatment of a rare probiotic infection. Vigilance regarding the detection of possible rare cases of infection due to probiotics should be maintained, and isolates should be sent to reference centers for molecular characterization and confirmation.

### Lb: A useful pharmabiotic for the treatment of digestive disorders [^1156yKVG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Lactobacillales represent one of the most diverse and heterogeneous orders of lactic-acid-producing bacteria that include the genus Lactobacillus, among other producers of lactic acid (e.g. Streptococcus and Bifidobacteria). Lactic acid is the final product of the fermentation of carbohydrates. Lactobacillus spp. are facultative anaerobic, catalase-negative, Gram-positive, and non-spore-forming bacilli. Along with other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Lactobacillus spp. are the first to colonize the human gut after birth. Lactobacilli are typical components of the gut and vaginal microbiota and, only occasionally, they play a role as pathogens.

Lactobacilli have long been used to produce various milk derivatives, such as cheese and yogurt. They have a high resistance to very low pH conditions, which eases their passage through the stomach. Important characteristics of lactobacilli which confer therapeutic potential in humans include:

- **Resistance to pH**: The pH of the human stomach is typically between 2 and 2.5. Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus gasseri survive in such conditions for at least 90 minutes, which is enough time for them to reach their site of action in the intestine. The survival of lactobacilli in acid depends on the strain studied.

- **Resistance to bile**: Conjugated and unconjugated bile acids show antibacterial activity and inhibit the in vitro growth of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterococcus spp. Although many lactobacilli show some resistance to bovine and porcine bile in vitro, they are resistant to human bile.

### Probiotics [LGG-BB12 or RC14-GR1] versus placebo as prophylaxis for urinary tract infection in persons with spinal cord injury [ProSCIUTTU]: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^117H2eKt]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in people with a neurogenic bladder. People with a spinal cord injury (SCI) and those with the spinal demyelinating form of multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly susceptible to the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. UTIs have a high societal cost, and prevention strategies do not work effectively. People with neurogenic bladder are at significant risk from UTI, with approximately two UTI episodes per year on average for persons with SCI.

One of the major clinical challenges for SCI patients and clinicians is that when patients get a UTI, simple oral antibiotics frequently are ineffective due to the high numbers of multi-resistant organisms (MROs) within SCI populations, affecting about 40–50% of SCI individuals. This greatly amplifies the health, societal, and economic consequences of disease and can even lead to life-threatening clinical problems that can spread if not controlled through hospitals and the community. Health care costs associated with cross infection are estimated at US$18–30 billion yearly in the United States and UK combined, with Australian costs expected to be proportionate.

Furthermore, based on the existing SCI UTI prevention literature, it has been demonstrated that commonly used methods of non-antibiotic UTI prevention in SCI do not work effectively. The prevention of UTI, particularly the more difficult to treat MRO UTI, is therefore a clinical imperative for those people with SCI and neurogenic bladder. Non-antibiotic prevention is needed to prevent UTIs without increasing the antimicrobial resistance burden.

### Perspectives from the Society for Pediatric Research: Probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^114nYd73]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Probiotics have received significant attention within both the scientific and lay communities for their potential health-promoting properties, including the treatment or prevention of various conditions in children. In this article, we review the published data on the use of specific probiotic strains for three common pediatric conditions: the prevention of urinary tract infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Research into the utility of specific probiotic strains is of varying quality, and data are often derived from small studies and case series. We discuss the scientific merit of these studies, their overall findings regarding the utility of probiotics for these indications, issues in the reporting of methods, and results from these clinical trials, as well as future areas of investigation.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115HKeCK]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

In only 60% of the examined samples (26 out of 43 UTI cases) was the organism identified in culture the most prevalent organism in the sample as measured by cfDNA. Whereas bacterial culture is skewed toward species that are readily isolated on routine bacteriological media employed for urine culture, cfDNA sequence analyses permit the identification of a broader spectrum of bacterial species. To evaluate this concept further, we assayed two samples collected from one of the subjects included in the analysis above diagnosed with Haemophilus influenzae bacteruria. H. influenzae is a very uncommon uropathogen that does not routinely grow on media employed for conventional urine culture, such as tryptic soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar. Repeated urine cultures for this patient were negative, but given a urinalysis suggestive of a UTI and given that the patient developed H. influenzae bacteremia, the original urine specimen collected at presentation was re-plated onto chocolate agar, upon which H. influenzae was isolated. In the sample taken at the time of presentation, which was cultured, and also a sample taken four days after presentation, we observed H. influenzae cfDNA (0.037 RGE and 0.41 RGE, respectively). This case supports the utility of urinary cfDNA to identify infections where conventional culture fails.

- **Profiling the urinary microbiome**: The urinary tract was once regarded as sterile; however, recent studies have revealed that it often harbors microbiota. We examined the composition of the urinary microbiome by urinary cfDNA profiling (absence of UTI, n = 43).

### In-depth microbiological characterization of urine from subjects with type 2 diabetes [^115JHTv3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Gender differences in the human microbiota are implicitly due to differences in anatomical structures and hormone levels. In particular, higher levels of Lactobacillus spp. have been observed in the urinary tract of aging women with T2D, confirming our finding of more lactobacilli in slightly younger females with T2D. The increase of lactobacilli could be mainly attributed to L. iners prevailing in T2D in our study; conversely, the prevalence of L. gasseri, a probiotic bacterium also inhabiting the vagina of some women, was drastically reduced in T2D. In previous studies, L. gasseri showed anti-obesity and anti-insulin resistance effects. Its reduction in the urinary tract in conjunction with T2D could be one of the factors leading to the increase of insulin resistance typical of T2D.

Prevalences of F. hominis and N. succinicivorans were selectively reduced in males with T2D. A few cases of genitourinary and urinary tract-derived blood infections due to these two species have been reported in recent years, including pyelonephritis, balanoposthitis, and interstitial cystitis. Although their role in human health still needs to be explored, the lowering of such bacteria in T2D may thus correlate with a reduced risk of infection in males. In parallel, in females with T2D, W. neuii was found to be less prevalent than in healthy women. Winkia neuii is a common colonizer of the skin and female urinary tract, and rarely can cause infections in humans. As with F. hominis and N. succinicivorans, the reduction of such a potential pathogen in T2D could represent a positive aspect but…

### Efficacy of probiotic prophylaxis after the first febrile urinary tract infection in children with normal urinary tracts [^1144FiCR]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Growing antibiotic resistance and debates over their efficacy in preventing urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence warrant studying non-antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing UTI recurrences.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 181 children, aged 4 months to 5 years, with a normal urinary tract after recovery from their first febrile UTI, in a 1:1 ratio to receive a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium lactis (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90) for a total of 18 months of therapy. The primary objective was to show the superiority of probiotic prophylaxis over placebo. The primary end point was composite cure (UTI-free survival) at 18 months, and the secondary end point was the median time to first UTI recurrence.

- **Results**: The probiotics were superior to placebo regarding the primary efficacy endpoint. At 18 months, composite cure was observed in 96.7% (3 of 91) of the patients in the probiotic group and 83.3% (15 of 90) of those in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The median time to the first incidence of UTI recurrence was 3.5 months (range, 1–4 months) and 6.5 months (range, 2–14 months) in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.04). The main microorganism that caused recurrent UTI was Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and these results were not significantly different between the two groups. We found no specific adverse events among the participants who received the probiotic mixture during the course of therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The probiotics were more effective than placebo in preventing UTI recurrence in children with normal urinary tracts.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI, or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### The urinary microbiome in patients with refractory urge incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infection [^11782o2F]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The diversity of the urinary microbiota in the 9 patients was investigated by examining the 38 urine samples using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A median of 25 genera of bacteria (IQR 21–36) per patient was detected. Based on the relative abundance of the top 15 bacterial taxa, the samples clustered into six different urotypes, with samples in the same urotype sharing ≥ 80% similarity by Euclidean distance.

The most common urotype was U5 (n = 12; dominated by Corynebacteriaceae), followed by U3 (n = 10; dominated by Escherichia), U6 (n = 10; diverse organisms), U4 (n = 3; dominated by Lactobacillus), U1 (n = 2; dominated by Klebsiella), and U2 (n = 1; dominated by Staphylococcus). Each patient had at least two and up to four different urotypes, suggesting a continuous flux in their urinary microbiota. Overall, the most abundant organism identified by culture-independent analysis showed high concordance with the dominant organism identified by traditional microbiology culturing.

- **Clustering of urinary microbial profiles**: Clustering into six urotypes is demonstrated by the dendrogram and the dominant bacterial taxa present are depicted in the histogram. Traditional microbiology results are also shown to demonstrate the concordance between two different methods. The urine samples are identified by patient (P) number followed by sample (S) number from that patient. The dendrogram was based on Euclidean distance between urine samples, and samples were clustered at ≥ 80% similarity.

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^1159m6Lp]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Contrary to medical dogma, urine is not sterile, even in asymptomatic individuals. For over 60 years, the standard urine culture protocol has been the primary tool for detecting bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. This aerobic protocol was designed to detect causative agents of pyelonephritis and is particularly effective at detecting abundant Escherichia coli (> 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/ml) but little else. Culture-independent analysis of urine obtained by suprapubic aspirate, which bypasses the vulva, vagina, and urethra, demonstrates the presence of bacteria in the bladders of women. The microbial profiles observed in aspirated urine are similar to those in urine obtained by transurethral catheter (TUC), indicating the avoidance of urethral contamination in catheterized samples.

We note the difference between TUC, which is transient and not associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and indwelling catheters that are known to harbor biofilms and result in CAUTI. Analyzing urine sampled by TUC, we previously found that the majority of asymptomatic women contain bacterial genera typically not detected by standard urine culture. These genera, including Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, tend to be in low abundance (between 10 and 10⁴ CFU/ml) and require growth conditions and carbon sources not available in standard urine culture. Therefore, we developed an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol that captures a broad range of bacterial taxa.

### The ability of prior urinary culture results to predict future culture results in neurogenic bladder patients [^1129JpxF]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine if previous urinary cultures can predict the organism and susceptibility of subsequent urinary cultures in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified a sample of neurogenic bladder patients from a tertiary care urology clinic (July 2015 - July 2016). We reviewed patient charts and used electronic laboratory records to identify all urine cultures conducted in the prior two years. Sequential culture pairs were identified, and the concordance of the initial culture organism to the subsequent one was determined, along with the concordance of the initial culture's antibiotic resistance status to the subsequent culture's status.

- **Results**: We identified 146 individuals with neurogenic bladder, primarily due to spinal cord injury (n = 61), multiple sclerosis (n = 26), or spina bifida (n = 25). These individuals primarily used intermittent catheterization (n = 69, 47%), spontaneous voiding (n = 59, 40%), or indwelling Foley catheter (n = 31, 21%). During the previous two years, 81 participants had at least two positive urine cultures, totaling 479 cultures available for examination regarding organism/susceptibility concordance. There was a 56% concordance of bacterial species between subsequent urine cultures, with a significant decrease in concordance as the time between cultures increased (P = 0.02). Antibiotic susceptibility concordance was high for ciprofloxacin (77%), nitrofurantoin (79%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75%), with no significant change over time (P > 0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Previous positive urine cultures can provide valuable insights into predicting future culture results in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: Rapid evidence review [^116RajvE]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a urine culture with susceptibility testing in females with recurrent UTIs, treatment failure with first-line antibiotics, a history of resistant urinary isolates, atypical presentation, or in those who are ≥ 65 years of age. It is also recommended in males to guide antibiotic choice.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^113dwGy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity, including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis, and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to the development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses to make informed patient care decisions.

- **Objectives**: Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared.

### The new world of the urinary microbiota in women [^112ci2BM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence challenges the long-held paradigm that the healthy bladder is sterile. These discoveries may provide new opportunities to address important women's health conditions, which include preterm labor and delivery, urinary tract infections, and common forms of urinary incontinence. Traditional tools for urinary bacterial assessment, including urinary dipsticks and standard urine cultures, have significant limitations that restrict the information available to clinicians. For example, the standard urine culture does not detect slow-growing bacteria that perish in the presence of oxygen.

Two new, complementary tools, however, can detect these and other organisms, permitting a more complete characterization of bacterial communities within the female bladder. Obstetrician-gynecologists should become familiar with these new approaches — expanded quantitative urine culture and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing — that can detect previously unrecognized organisms. These advances make it possible to answer previously intractable scientific and clinical questions.

The traditional nomenclature used to describe the bacterial status in the bladder is quite dated and unsuited for the emerging information about the bacterial milieu of the female urinary tract. In the context of the sterile bladder paradigm, clinicians have learned about "uropathogens", "asymptomatic bacteriuria", and "urinary tract infection". Given that the lower urinary tract is not sterile, these terms should be reevaluated. Clinicians can already benefit from the emerging knowledge regarding urinary microbiota.

### Lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities [^1116zCui]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The genus Lactobacillus is taxonomically complex, comprising over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. Although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens. They are extensively used in various commercial products, including probiotics.

Their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined due to their taxonomic complexity, compounded by the differing methods recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and the International Dairy Federation. Their use as probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide. This raises the question of whether the use of any antibiotic will affect their ability to survive.

Lactobacillus species are generally acid-resistant and able to survive ingestion. They are typically resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides, and ciprofloxacin. L. acidophilus is susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas L. rhamnosus and L. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

### Practical bench comparison of BBL CHROMagar orientation and standard two-plate media for urine cultures [^112FPfhU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 1,023 urine samples sent for routine culture were plated onto sheep blood and MacConkey agars and a BBL CHROMagar orientation (CO; Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) plate, and the results were compared. Of these, 250 urine samples (24%) grew > 10,000 CFU of one or two putative pathogens/ml, and 773 showed no growth (NG), mixed growth, or contaminants.

- **Efficiency improvements**: CO showed a > 50% reduction in inoculation time and a > 20% reduction in work-up time. For our laboratory, with 50% "no growth" and approximately 25% significant results (50% Escherichia coli), CO allowed time and workup cost savings for a majority of cultures.

- **Cost analysis**: A cost analysis (time and supplies for our laboratory) showed that if CO is used alone, the break-even level for CO pricing is $1.78.

### Can vaginal lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections [^111RyyrU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the healthcare economy. Vaginal probiotics and supplements have gained significant attention in mainstream media and lay press as a non-antibiotic alternative. We performed a systematic review to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for rUTI.

- **Methods**: A PubMed/MEDLINE article search was performed from inception to August 2022 for prospective, in vivo use of vaginal suppositories for the prevention of rUTIs. Search terms included: vaginal probiotic suppository (34 results), vaginal probiotic randomized (184 results), vaginal probiotic prevention (441 results), vaginal probiotic UTI (21 results), and vaginal probiotic urinary tract infection (91 results). A total of 771 article titles and abstracts were screened.

- **Results**: A total of 8 articles fit the inclusion criteria and were reviewed and summarized. Four were randomized controlled trials, with 3 of the studies having a placebo arm. Three were prospective cohort studies, and 1 was a single arm, open label trial. Five of the 7 articles that specifically evaluated for rUTI reduction with vaginal suppositories found a decreased incidence with probiotic use; however, only 2 had statistically significant results. Both of these were studies of Lactobacillus crispatus and were not randomized. Three studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus as a vaginal suppository.

- **Conclusion**: Data support the use of vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus as a safe and effective measure.

### A comparison of the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar with Oxoid chromogenic urinary tract infection (CUTI) medium for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine [^116xpZMv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

As part of the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy and action plan, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) is required to collect antibiotic susceptibility data so that resistance trends and patterns can be monitored. Most laboratories report urine Gram-negative isolates as "coliforms" according to morphological appearance. However, without an acceptable identification system, the antimicrobial surveillance data will be meaningless. Commercially available identification systems tend to be expensive and time-consuming. Chromogenic agars, which claim to improve the detection of mixed cultures and identification of organisms from urine, have now become available and may provide a cost-effective alternative.

The primary aim of this study was to compare the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar with a chromogenic agar (Oxoid urinary tract infection medium; CUTI) in terms of isolation rates and ability to detect mixed cultures. Secondary aims were to evaluate the correlation of "presumptive" identification of isolates from chromogenic media with that of two commercial identification systems and to appraise the sensitivity of the semiquantitative loop and filter paper strip culture techniques.

One thousand, four hundred and sixty-six urine samples were examined in four laboratories using the semiquantitative culture methods of a 1-microliter loop and filter paper strip. The degree of accuracy of organism identification was measured by comparing the presumptive identification using colony color supplemented with simple bench tests, with identification from commercial systems.

### Probiotic agents to protect the urogenital tract against infection [^113uZ5Xh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

The urogenital microflora of a healthy woman comprises approximately 50 species of organisms, which differ in composition according to reproductive stages and exposure to several factors, including antibiotics and spermicides. Infections are very common, with over 300 million cases of urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast vaginitis worldwide per annum. During infections in the bladder and vagina, the urogenital flora is often dominated by the infecting pathogens, in contrast to healthy phases when indigenous organisms dominate.

Premenopausal women typically have a flora rich in lactobacilli, and certain properties of these strains, including adhesive ability and production of acids, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide, and biosurfactants, appear important in conferring protection to the host. Efforts to artificially restore an unbalanced flora using probiotics have met with mixed results. However, research aimed at selecting scientifically based strains could provide a reliable alternative treatment and preventive regimen to antibiotics in the future.
