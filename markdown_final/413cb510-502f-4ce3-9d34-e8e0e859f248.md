## Question

Can bactrim treat MRSA pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX) can be used to treat MRSA pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of MRSA pneumonia. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for empiric and definitive therapy. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence comparing TMP-SMX to standard agents. After that, I need to check pharmacologic considerations that could limit efficacy in pneumonia. I will then examine susceptibility and resistance patterns. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, dosing if used off-label, and synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. MRSA pneumonia spans community-acquired and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated disease, and severity ranges from nonsevere cases to severe disease with bacteremia, respiratory failure, or septic shock; outcomes hinge on early appropriate therapy, so I need to ensure we anchor recommendations to severity and setting before discussing any off-label use of TMP-SMX.

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guideline recommends vancomycin or linezolid as first-line therapy when MRSA coverage is indicated, and it does not list TMP-SMX as a recommended option for MRSA pneumonia; similarly, the ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommends vancomycin or linezolid when MRSA coverage is warranted, again not including TMP-SMX, which signals that TMP-SMX is not a guideline-endorsed therapy for MRSA pneumonia [^1143qNPq] [^111QukQv] [^114uuCmt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the direct comparative evidence. The pivotal randomized trial of high-dose TMP-SMX versus vancomycin for severe MRSA infections failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of TMP-SMX and showed higher treatment failure, with a particularly concerning signal for increased mortality among bacteremic patients; importantly, pneumonia cases were included in the "severe infection" cohort, so these data directly inform the pneumonia question and argue against TMP-SMX as a primary agent in severe MRSA infections, including pneumonia with bacteremia [^116cvZxm] [^116Krma2] [^11521KG7] [^114CiuUb].

> I need to check pharmacologic considerations that could undermine lung efficacy. TMP-SMX's activity can be antagonized by exogenous thymidine released from damaged host tissues and bacteria, a phenomenon well described in high-burden infections like pneumonia; this mechanistic limitation, coupled with concerns about tissue penetration and bactericidal activity in the lung, further weakens the rationale for TMP-SMX in severe MRSA pneumonia compared with vancomycin or linezolid, which have robust clinical data in this setting [^116TpuFU].

> Let me consider susceptibility patterns, because even if an agent is active in vitro, local resistance matters. Contemporary data show high TMP-SMX susceptibility among MRSA isolates in many regions, often exceeding 90%, but resistance can be substantial in some locales, and susceptibility alone does not guarantee clinical efficacy in pneumonia; thus, I should confirm that local antibiograms support activity but not overinterpret susceptibility as proof of clinical effectiveness in this syndrome [^11471bHB].

> But wait, what about special scenarios or salvage therapy. In select nonsevere, non-bacteremic cases with confirmed TMP-SMX susceptibility, after failure or intolerance of first-line agents, cautious off-label use may be considered, ideally with close monitoring and in consultation with infectious diseases; however, this remains off-label and unsupported by high-quality pneumonia-specific data, so I should frame this as a conditional, last-resort option rather than standard care [^113cLKAX].

> I should double-check dosing if someone is contemplating off-label use. High-dose TMP-SMX has been studied at 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily intravenously or orally, adjusted for renal function; however, this dosing comes from studies of severe MRSA infections and not pneumonia-specific trials, so extrapolation to pneumonia is uncertain and must be individualized with renal monitoring and awareness of adverse effects including hyperkalemia, hematologic toxicity, and crystalluria [^112Wx9eX] [^1136cCih].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. For severe MRSA pneumonia, particularly with bacteremia or high bacterial burden, TMP-SMX should not be used given inferior outcomes in RCTs and mechanistic concerns; vancomycin or linezolid are the evidence-based standards. For nonsevere MRSA pneumonia without bacteremia, TMP-SMX lacks guideline support and sufficient pneumonia-specific evidence, so vancomycin or linezolid remain preferred; if TMP-SMX is considered off-label, it should be in carefully selected, stable patients with confirmed susceptibility, with close follow-up and a low threshold to switch if there is no early response [^1143qNPq] [^111QukQv] [^116cvZxm].

> Final answer: No, Bactrim (TMP-SMX) is not recommended as primary therapy for MRSA pneumonia; vancomycin or linezolid are the guideline-preferred agents, and TMP-SMX should generally be avoided in severe disease, especially with bacteremia, due to inferior efficacy signals and mechanistic limitations, with any off-label use reserved for select nonsevere cases with confirmed susceptibility and careful monitoring [^1143qNPq] [^111QukQv] [^116cvZxm].

---

Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for MRSA pneumonia because of limited clinical evidence and inferior outcomes compared with vancomycin or linezolid [^113cLKAX] [^116cvZxm]. It may be considered only when the isolate is susceptible and first-line agents are contraindicated or unavailable, but **use is controversial** due to concerns about efficacy in severe infections [^116TpuFU]. Current guidelines recommend vancomycin or linezolid as preferred therapy for MRSA pneumonia [^1143qNPq] [^114uuCmt].

---

## Clinical evidence for Bactrim in MRSA pneumonia

- **Limited evidence**: There is sparse clinical evidence supporting Bactrim for MRSA pneumonia; most data come from small observational studies or case series, not randomized controlled trials [^113cLKAX].

- **Inferior outcomes**: A randomized controlled trial found Bactrim did not achieve non-inferiority to vancomycin for severe MRSA infections, with higher treatment failure and a trend toward higher mortality in bacteremia, suggesting inferior efficacy in severe disease [^116cvZxm] [^112kFk7a].

- **Pharmacologic concerns**: Bactrim's efficacy may be limited by exogenous thymidine release from damaged host tissues, which can antagonize its antifolate mechanism, particularly in high-burden infections like pneumonia [^116TpuFU].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) **do not recommend Bactrim as first-line therapy** for MRSA pneumonia. Instead, they recommend vancomycin or linezolid as preferred agents [^1143qNPq] [^114uuCmt].

| **Guideline** | **Recommended therapy for MRSA pneumonia** |
|-|-|
| IDSA/ATS 2016 | - Vancomycin <br/> - Linezolid |
| IDSA/ATS 2019 | - Vancomycin <br/> - Linezolid |

---

Bactrim is **not included as a first-line option** in these guidelines due to limited evidence and concerns about efficacy in severe infections [^1143qNPq] [^114uuCmt].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Bactrim may be considered

Bactrim may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Susceptible isolates**: The MRSA isolate is confirmed susceptible to Bactrim, and first-line agents are contraindicated or unavailable.

- **Mild infections**: Patients have mild-to-moderate infections without severe systemic involvement or risk factors for complications.

- **Oral therapy**: Patients cannot tolerate intravenous therapy, and oral options are required.

However, these scenarios are **exceptional**, and careful clinical judgment is required [^113cLKAX].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Bactrim is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects can occur**, including:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving potassium-sparing diuretics [^1136cCih].

- **Hematologic toxicity**: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [^1136cCih].

- **Renal impairment**: Risk of crystalluria and renal failure, especially at high doses or with inadequate hydration [^1136cCih].

- **Severe hypersensitivity reactions**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis [^1136cCih].

These risks must be weighed against potential benefits, especially in severe infections where first-line agents are preferred [^116cvZxm].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Vancomycin and linezolid are the **preferred first-line therapies** for MRSA pneumonia, supported by robust clinical evidence and guideline recommendations [^1143qNPq] [^114uuCmt]. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with established efficacy, though it requires monitoring for nephrotoxicity and therapeutic drug levels [^115ynTJ8]. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, offers excellent oral bioavailability and lung penetration but carries risks of myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome [^114b2STY]. Bactrim is generally less effective than these agents in severe MRSA infections, particularly in bacteremic patients [^116cvZxm].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bactrim is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for MRSA pneumonia due to limited clinical evidence and inferior outcomes compared with vancomycin or linezolid [^113cLKAX] [^116cvZxm]. It may be considered in select cases with susceptible isolates and mild infections, but clinicians should exercise caution and monitor closely for clinical response and adverse effects. Vancomycin or linezolid remain the preferred agents for MRSA pneumonia [^1143qNPq] [^114uuCmt].

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^113cLKAX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^11471bHB]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an old antibiotic active against Staphylococcus aureus. Trimethoprim is the main active component and bactericidal in itself, but the combination is highly synergistic. With increasing rates of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in healthcare settings and in the community, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been suggested as a convenient treatment option.

MRSA isolates have retained susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in many locations worldwide despite several decades of exposure to the antibiotic. Coverage rates above 90% are described in contemporary reports for community associated MRSA and nosocomial isolates in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, Israel, and Turkey. Resistance is described in Australia, where 30% of nosocomial and 10% of community associated MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2012, but a significant trend for decreasing resistance from 2005 was observed, unlike other antibiotics. In sub-Saharan Africa, 19% resistance has been recently documented, owing to high rates of trimethoprim resistance. In India, more than 85% of MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between 2009 and 2011.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections but not for MRSA bacteraemia or pneumonia. Vancomycin is the primary treatment recommendation for these infections. Alternatives to vancomycin are sought as vancomycin is inferior to β lactams in meticillin susceptible S aureus infections, and it may be less effective against MRSA at the higher end of the vancomycin susceptible range. In a small observational study, we reported similar outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia. Favourable outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin were reported in an observational study focusing on infections caused by MRSA with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL to vancomycin. In both studies, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given to significantly less ill patients.

We did a randomised controlled trial to assess whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of inpatients with severe MRSA infections, including bacteraemia.

Sample size and analysis

To establish non-inferiority, we allowed a difference of up to 15% in the primary outcome. Assuming a 30% treatment failure rate for both treatment groups, we needed a sample of 128 patients per arm for a one sided test to rule out the pre-specified difference in the 95% confidence interval of the difference between groups, allowing for 10% non-evaluable patients (α = 0.05, β = 0.8). We did interim analyses of the primary safety outcome after recruitment of one third and two thirds of patients, with stopping boundaries (two sided α level, P < 0.01).

We did the primary analysis by intention to treat. We did per protocol analysis for patients without exclusion criteria after randomisation who received allocated treatment for a minimum of seven days. We did subgroup analysis for patients with MRSA bacteraemia. We used χ² or Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical outcomes. Continuous outcomes were skewed, so we described them as medians and compared them by using a median difference, all with 95% confidence intervals. We did multivariable analyses for the primary efficacy outcome, including the treatment arm as an independent variable. We entered all variables significantly associated with the outcome on univariate analysis (P < 0.05) and not correlated (Spearman correlation > 0.5) into a logistic regression analysis. We present risk ratios or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is therefore used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from infections caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 h. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately, 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration‐dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high‐dose cotrimoxazole.

Lastly, reference lists of all papers that were deemed to be eligible during pilot searches were reviewed to identify any relevant publications that may have been cited.

The title and abstract (when available) of each publication were reviewed for relevance to the topic. When it was obvious from the title and/or abstract that a publication was not relevant, it was eliminated. When it was less clear, the full paper was read to determine whether it met all the inclusion criteria.

Eligible studies were reviewed for quality using quality assessment tools that were adapted from the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The tools were used to make a structured assessment of whether a study was protected from bias and confounding. Of interest in this aspect was the extent to which studies took account of these confounders: (1) stage of HIV disease, (2) previous hospitalization, and (3) previous antibiotic use. Assessments were made on whether each study had internal and external validity. A standardized form was used to extract data. One person (ELS) reviewed and extracted the data, and when there were uncertainties, advice was sought from one of the co-authors.

The findings from the studies were synthesized, with more credence being placed on studies that had fared better in the quality assessment process. In theory, it would have been possible to meta-analyze the results from studies reporting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and studies reporting pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. In practice, however, the studies that examined penicillin resistance reported differing outcomes; thus, it was not possible to combine them. It was possible to conduct separate meta-analyses for case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies of infection and/or colonization with MRSA.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^112Wx9eX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We used a central computer generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^116cvZxm]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority compared with vancomycin among patients with invasive MRSA infections. In the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia, the difference in treatment failure and all cause mortality might be clinically important. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for the treatment of severe MRSA infections. We propose a further randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of step-down from vancomycin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allowing early discharge of patients with MRSA responding to treatment.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1113MbZX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The main treatment options for MRSA infections other than vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. Most of the new antibiotics were evaluated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials. Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials and when reported was very low (usually < 1%). Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not include only MRSA. Daptomycin was non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial including 245 patients with S aureus bacteraemia, of whom 89 had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin. The overall mortality was 11%. Similar efficacy and safety for was shown for linezolid and vancomycin in nosocomial pneumonia, and the mortality rate in these trials was 14%. Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial including 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections, but most were skin and soft tissue infections (mortality rate 5%). Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA, overall mortality in the study 19%). Compared with these trials, ours included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as evidenced by the mortality rates, more closely reflecting patients treated with MRSA infections in clinical practice.

Limitations of study

The main limitation of our trial is the small sample size of patients with bacteraemia, in whom results suggest an important advantage for vancomycin. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline for nearly all variables. However, a subtle difference existed for important prognostic variables, and more patients allocated to vancomycin were bacteraemic. Multivariable analysis of the entire study cohort showed a larger advantage of vancomycin with regard to treatment failure, reaching statistical significance. Patients with polymicrobial infections and receiving additional antibiotics were included in the study, reflecting its pragmatic nature. However, these were mostly inactive against MRSA and concomitant antibiotics covering MRSA were not allowed at randomisation. Patients excluded owing to inability to provide informed consent had higher severity of illness scores than those included, affecting the trial's external validity. Finally, the dosing of vancomycin and trough levels achieved (≥ 15 µg/mL in only 67% of patients) were lower than currently recommended, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the efficacy of vancomycin and the difference between arms.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^111PQgfk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111kKcmx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003) and EMBASE (1980-February 2003). Key search terms included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and Staphylococcus aureus.

Data Synthesis

An evaluation of case reports, case series, and clinical studies focusing on the use of TMP/SMX for treatment of severe S. aureus infections was conducted. The majority of the reports indicate that TMP/SMX may be effective for the treatment of infections due to low bacterial burdens of susceptible strains of S. aureus.

Conclusions

In select infections, TMP/SMX may be a useful alternative to vancomycin for treatment of severe S. aureus infections. Additional randomized studies should be conducted comparing this agent with vancomycin and linezolid.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^116yn9zF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment decisions in MRSA bacteremia require consideration of the prevalence and resistance profile of local strains, risk factors for a complicated clinical course, presence of comorbidities, concurrent interventions, and response to prior antibiotics. Current US and European treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 3. For most cases of MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin or daptomycin is the recommended treatment. The choice of antibiotic may also depend on if the bacteremia is secondary to another infection. For example, daptomycin, although indicated for treatment of SAB, is contraindicated for SAB originating from pneumonia since pulmonary surfactants inactivate it. Vancomycin poorly penetrates lung tissue; thus, linezolid or clindamycin are recommended if the strain is susceptible. Reports of MRSA isolates resistant or nonsusceptible to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftaroline, as well as multidrug-resistant MRSA clones, are a concerning trend. These data highlight the importance of early identification of MRSA and susceptibility to identify the optimal antibiotic.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^116Krma2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To show non-inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin for the treatment of severe infections due to meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Design Parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial.

Setting Four acute care hospitals in Israel.

Participants Adults with severe infections caused by MRSA susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Patients with left sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia were excluded.

Interventions Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin 1 g twice daily for a minimum of seven days and then by indication.

Main outcome measures The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure assessed at day 7, consisting of death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of bacteraemia. The primary safety outcome was all cause mortality at day 30. Non-inferiority was defined by a difference of less than 15% for treatment failure.

Results 252 patients were included in the trial, of whom 91 (36%) had bacteraemia. No significant difference in treatment failure was seen for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (51/135, 38%) versus vancomycin (32/117, 27%) — risk ratio 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not meet the non-inferiority criterion — absolute difference 10.4% (95% confidence interval −1.2% to 21.5%). For patients with bacteraemia, the risk ratio was 1.40 (0.91 to 2.16). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly associated with treatment failure (adjusted odds ratio 2.00, 1.09 to 3.65). The 30 day mortality rate was 32/252 (13%), with no significant difference between arms. Among patients with bacteraemia, 14/41 (34%) treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 9/50 (18%) with vancomycin died (risk ratio 1.90, 0.92 to 3.93).

Conclusions High dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority to vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections. The difference was particularly marked for patients with bacteraemia.

Trial registration Clinical trials NCT00427076.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115RpqsH]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of currently approved treatments, other options are being developed. Vaccines targeting one or more S. aureus antigens have had minimal success to date and are reviewed elsewhere. Several studies have evaluated alternative antibacterials, including ceftaroline, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), although none have been approved for treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Ceftaroline is indicated for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by S. aureus, but is often used off-label to treat SAB. A recent multicenter study found that approximately 70% of patients with MRSA bacteremia experienced clinical success when ceftaroline was used as a salvage therapy alone or in combination with another antistaphylococcal antibiotic. Clinical trials of ceftaroline compared to other MRSA bacteremia antimicrobials are still needed. Linezolid, indicated for pneumonia and complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by S. aureus, was effective as a salvage therapy for MRSA bacteremia. It is bacteriostatic against staphylococci, while the other treatments are bactericidal. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is indicated for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by MSSA, but is known to have in vitro activity against MRSA. In a study using Q/D as salvage therapy for 12 patients with MRSA or methicillin-resistant S. epidermis infections that did not respond to vancomycin, five of seven MRSA bacteremic patients showed eradication of the bacteria. Telavancin is approved for use in Gram-positive cSSSI and hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), and it is currently being evaluated for treatment of S. aureus bacteremia in a phase 3 trial (NCT02208063). In the clinical trials comparing telavancin to vancomycin, clinical cure rates for patients with cSSSI or HABP/VABP with baseline MRSA bacteremia were 61.5 and 52.4% for telavancin-treated patients and 50.0 and 37.5% in vancomycin-treated patients, respectively. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been suggested as an alternative treatment; however, it failed to meet noninferiority criteria compared with vancomycin in several trials of severe MRSA infections, including SAB.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^11521KG7]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This was an open label, parallel, one to one randomised controlled trial, conducted in four acute care hospitals (Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva (192 patients); Rambam Health Care Campus (38 patients); Holy Family Hospital Nazareth (7 patients); Wolfson Medical Center (6 patients)) in Israel, between July 2007 and April 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal guardian.

Study population and procedures

We included adult inpatients with severe infections caused by MRSA, including bacteraemia, and patients with highly probable MRSA infections. We defined bacteraemia as the isolation of MRSA in more than one blood culture bottle or isolated in a single bottle and accompanied by fever above 38°C, chills, or systolic blood pressure under 90 mm Hg. We defined other microbiologically documented MRSA infections by using predefined criteria adapted from surveillance definitions of healthcare associated infections, plus isolation of MRSA from a sterile sample from the source of infection. Patients with skin and soft tissue infections could be included only if they fulfilled the sepsis inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Patients with polymicrobial infections could be included, except those involving meticillin susceptible S aureus or mandating treatment with vancomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The highly probable group included patients with ventilator associated pneumonia and prior antibiotic treatment, central catheter related infections, and surgical site infections in the presence of a foreign body, all without microbiological documentation. We excluded patients who had received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin for more than 48 hours; patients with MRSA resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin; those with highly suspected or confirmed left sided endocarditis or meningitis; patients with chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min) and chronic haemodialysis (those with severe acute renal failure, including acute haemodialysis, could be included); neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia or bone marrow transplantation; and patients with known allergy to either study drug, treatment with methotrexate, pregnancy or lactation, previous enrolment in this study, or concurrent participation in another trial.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114oUcbz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to type 1 studies, for type 2 studies, there was stronger evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects from infection with drug-resistant bacteria. Four studies, all considered of good quality, reported reduced infection and/or colonization with MRSA, and 1 study, also of good quality, reported no change in colonization with MRSA. The 2 lower-quality studies in this group reported increased MRSA. The meta-analysis of MRSA cohort studies revealed a 70% protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis from MRSA infection (relative risk,.29; 95% confidence interval,.12–.7)

It is plausible that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against infection with drug-resistant bacteria. TMP-SMX may directly protect against colonization and/or infection with drug-susceptible bacterial pathogens, and indirect protection may arise as a result of this as the individual is less exposed to conditions that have been found to be risk factors for infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. For example, the patient may no longer need frequent hospitalization or will be less likely to be exposed to intravenous catheters, conditions that have been shown to increase antibiotic resistance. As a result, the patient may be less likely to receive other antibiotics for treatment of infections, and such exposure to antibiotics has been shown to increase antibiotic resistance.

The finding by Gill et al that pneumococcal resistance to 1 of 5 antibiotics increased whereas there was no change in the resistance levels for the other 4 drugs might mean that it is possible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis to increase bacterial resistance to some classes of antibiotics but not to others. This may be feasible if the mechanism of development of resistance to TMP-SMX is linked to that of the other antibiotic. Multidrug resistance can be horizontally transferred between bacterial species and genus borders if the genes that code for multidrug resistance are located on transferable plasmids or transposons. It has been proposed that TMP-SMX prophylaxis may cause resistance to clindamycin or penicillin through co-selection of linked antibiotic resistance genes.

The strength of the Hamel et al study is that it was adjusted for baseline antibiotic resistance levels. Results from that study suggest that there is no effect of 6 months of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on antibiotic resistance among similarly exposed HIV-infected adults. This may also be explained by possible protection of TMP-SMX from infections, as explained above. Of note, the 2 studies that were designed to answer the question of this review reported no change in pneumococcal resistance to penicillin.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^111dXN5T]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results

We evaluated 782 patients with clinically significant MRSA isolates, of whom 252 were included. The main reasons for exclusion were previous treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin for more than 48 hours or inability to provide informed consent, related mostly to severity of sepsis (figure). Inclusion was based on microbiologically documented inclusion criteria in 245 (97%) patients: 91 (36%) with bacteraemia and 154 (61%) with MRSA isolated from other clinical samples. Patients' mean age was 65.8 (SD 17) years, and all infections were healthcare associated (218 (87%) hospital acquired). Characteristics of patients and infections were mostly balanced between groups; the exception was bacteraemia, which was more common in the vancomycin group (table 1). Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was infrequent. Surgical interventions and catheter extraction, when indicated, were performed in similar proportions in the two study groups. Vancomycin trough concentrations were available for 97/117 (82.9%) patients in the vancomycin arm (≥ 10 µg/mL in 80 (83%) patients and ≥ 15 µg/mL in 65 (67%) patients). Isolates' minimum inhibitory concentration to vancomycin was 2 µg/mL in 12/77 (16%) of patients in the vancomycin arm and lower in the remaining patients. All isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (disk zone ≤ 10 mm). The median duration of treatment with assigned antibiotics in the per protocol population was 17 (95% confidence interval 12 to 22) days with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 110) and 14 (13 to 15) days with vancomycin (n = 96). Potentially effective antibiotics against MRSA (mainly rifampin) were added throughout the treatment course for 14/135 (10%) patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole arm and 8/117 (7%) patients in the vancomycin arm (P = 0.32).

Discussion

In a randomised controlled trial including 252 patients with severe MRSA infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not fulfil criteria for non-inferiority to vancomycin. The absolute difference in treatment failure rates at day 7 — comprising death, clinical/haemodynamic instability, and persistence of bacteraemia — was 10.4% (−1.2% to 21.5%) in favour of vancomycin, crossing the upper limit of 15% difference defined for non-inferiority. After adjustment for differences between groups, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly associated with treatment failure (odds ratio 2.00, 1.09 to 3.65). Thirty day mortality did not differ significantly between groups (risk ratio 1.27, 0.65 to 2.45); however, among patients with bacteraemia (n = 91), death rates were non-significantly higher with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Results were similar in a per protocol analysis. Bacteriological cure and adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.

Our trial was pragmatic, targeting all patients treated with vancomycin in clinical practice. We defined no exclusion criteria related to severity of background illness or sepsis. Exclusions were based only on contraindications for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (such as chronic haemodialysis) or previous evidence suggesting inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We thus excluded left sided endocarditis owing to an in vivo study of endocarditis in rabbits showing lower survival and vegetation sterilisation and higher bacterial load on vegetations with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin and other antibiotics. We excluded patients with MRSA meningitis owing to inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to nafcillin in an experimental model of meticillin susceptible S aureus meningitis and lack of evidence in MRSA, despite good penetration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to the brain. We originally intended to recruit patients with non-microbiologically documented, highly probable MRSA infections. However, in practice, we found identifying such patients prospectively difficult and practically the trial included only patients with microbiologically confirmed MRSA infections. The main reason precluding inclusion of patients was inability to obtain informed consent at the time of acute sepsis. In Israel, regulations allow only legal guardians to replace patients' informed consent (informed consent from relatives is not allowed), and with acute conditions most patients did not have an appointed legal guardian.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Infusion-related reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim infusion can cause local irritation and inflammation in cases of extravasation.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- **Metabolic acidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains propylene glycol as a solvent, which at high doses can cause metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.
- **Sulfite sensitivity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions in susceptible patients.

Synthesis of Findings From the Studies

When looking at the study findings according to type of comparison group, 10 studies were considered to have type 1 comparisons, and 7 were considered to be type 2. Of type 1 studies, 4 were colonization studies (1 MRSA and 3 pneumococcal), 4 investigated infection (1 MRSA, 2 pneumococcal, and 1 various organisms), and 2 investigated both colonized and infected patients. Two of the 4 colonization studies, neither of which were considered to be good quality (1 pneumococcal and 1 MRSA), reported increased colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. One good-quality study reported no change, and another good-quality study reported mixed findings; among HIV-exposed infants, TMP-SMX prophylaxis increased pneumococcal resistance to clindamycin but had no effect on pneumococcal resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. Of the 4 infection studies, 2 (1 MRSA and 1 pneumococcus, neither considered to be good quality) reported no difference in rate of infection with drug-resistant pneumococcus, and 1 (not considered to be good quality) reported an increase. One study had too few isolates to allow meaningful interpretation of the results despite presenting the number of drug-resistant isolates in each group (TMP-SMX vs no TMP-SMX). The 2 studies (1 good quality) that investigated both colonized and infected patients reported increases in infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^112jJNwE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering an antibiotic with activity against MRSA in patients with HAP at high risk of mortality or with one of the following risk factors for MRSA infection:

- prior IV antibiotic use within 90 days

- hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin-resistant

- hospitalization in a unit where the prevalence of MRSA is not known.

### Treatment of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children [^113oaeWq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The concept of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) associated with broad resistance, nosocomial acquisition, and known risk factors has recently been expanded. A new type of MRSA that is resistant to fewer antibiotics has emerged in pediatric practice since the mid-1990s. These isolates are community acquired and have been reported from diverse geographic regions. Awareness of these organisms is important for appropriate treatment of S. aureus infections in children.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are similar in many respects to community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA). There are usually no differences in risk factors between children with CA-MRSA infections and those with CA-MSSA infections or their household contacts. In one study, however, multivariate analysis showed that age greater than 1 year and health care contact in the preceding month were significant risk factors for CA-MRSA. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most common manifestations, although serious invasive infections and death may occur. Pneumonia has been reported more often in children with CA-MRSA than in those with CA-MSSA. Clindamycin is an effective therapy for CA-MRSA, but there is a risk for development of clindamycin resistance during treatment of a CA-MRSA that is clindamycin susceptible and inducibly erythromycin resistant. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be effective, and linezolid is a new option for treatment.

Summary

The appearance of CA-MRSA has important implications for therapy of infections caused by S. aureus in children. Three specific issues are the development of resistance during clindamycin therapy, insufficient data on the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in serious CA-MRSA infections, and the appropriate role for newer antibiotics such as linezolid.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) [^113oPfZ7]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

### Inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococci: should clinicians and microbiologists be concerned? [^1174WAV2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The increasing incidence of a variety of infections due to Staphylococcus aureus — and, especially, the expanding role of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) — has led to emphasis on the need for safe and effective agents to treat both systemic and localized staphylococcal infections. Unlike most previously noted strains of health care-associated MRSA, community-acquired MRSA isolates are often susceptible to several non- beta -lactam drug classes, although they are usually not susceptible to macrolides. Several newer antimicrobial agents and a few older agents are available for treatment of systemic staphylococcal infections, but use may be limited by the relatively high cost of these agents or the need for parenteral administration. Inexpensive oral agents for treatment of localized, community-acquired MRSA infection include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and newer tetracyclines. Clindamycin has been used successfully to treat pneumonia and soft-tissue and musculoskeletal infections due to MRSA in adults and children. However, concern over the possibility of emergence of clindamycin resistance during therapy has discouraged some clinicians from prescribing that agent. Simple laboratory testing (e.g., the erythromycin-clindamycin "D-zone" test) can separate strains that have the genetic potential (i.e., the presence of erm genes) to become resistant during therapy from strains that are fully susceptible to clindamycin.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1148NgjB]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Few randomised controlled trials have assessed the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. A single randomised controlled trial compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against vancomycin for staphylococcal infections. The trial randomised 228 intravenous drug users with suspected staphylococcal infections and analysed 101 with proven infections (54 with meticillin susceptible S aureus and 47 with MRSA). Vancomycin was superior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among patients with meticillin susceptible S aureus infections, but no differences were observed for patients with MRSA. Specifically, bacteraemia duration (total 57 patients) was longer with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for meticillin susceptible S aureus (7.8 v 3.5 days; P = 0.05) and similar for MRSA (5.2 v 5.6 days). The authors concluded that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a valuable alternative for the treatment of MRSA infections, unlike the conclusions of our study. However, the study included significantly younger and less ill patients, with a single death compared with the 13% mortality rate in our study. In a recent randomised controlled trial, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampin was compared with linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infections (bacteraemia in 18/150 (12%) and mortality in 14/150 (9%)), showing no differences in failure/relapse rates or mortality. Among 50 patients with chronic meticillin susceptible S aureus osteomyelitis randomised to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin versus oxacillin, long term outcomes were similar and patients allocated to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin had a significantly shorter hospital stay (median 51 v 31 days). Finally, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not significantly different from doxycycline for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in a small randomised controlled trial assessing 22 patients with MRSA.

### Role of folate antagonists in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^116TpuFU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection has reached epidemic proportions, and therapeutic options are limited because these strains are often multidrug resistant. However, the new strains of community-acquired MRSA show decreased resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Clinical and experimental reports show a mixture of successes and failures with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment. A reason for failure might be the amount of thymidine released from damaged host tissues and bacteria, a concept strengthened by the fact that S. aureus thermonuclease releases thymidine from DNA. Thus, success or failure with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may well depend on the amount of tissue damage and organism burden, rather than acquisition of a resistance gene. Clinical trials and experimental animal studies show high failure rates, perhaps because of released thymidine. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for community-acquired MRSA infection should not be endorsed without further research.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was clinical treatment failure at seven days and was a composite of death, persistence of fever (< 38°C for two consecutive days and no increase above 38° after resolution was required to rule out persistence), persistence of hypotension (< 90 mm Hg systolic or need for vasopressor support), non-improving Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (for baseline SOFA ≥ 3, a decrease of at least 30% was required; and for baseline SOFA < 3, a stable or decreased SOFA score was required to rule out failure), or persistent bacteraemia on day 7. Blood cultures were repeated on day 2 for all patients with bacteraemia and daily thereafter for patients with persistent fever, persistent bacteraemia, or other signs of infection. We also defined a primary safety outcome of all cause mortality at 30 days.

Secondary outcomes included failure or modification of treatment, comprising treatment failure (as defined) or antibiotic treatment modification; bacteriological failure, defined as growth of MRSA on day 7 cultures; persistence of bacteraemia at 48 hours; length of hospital admission; duration of fever, summing all days with at least one measurement of temperature 38°C or above until day 30; and development of resistance defined as acquisition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin resistant S aureus or vancomycin resistant Enterococci. Adverse events included renal failure defined using RIFLE criteria, rash, leucopoenia, any diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, and other adverse events.

Diagnostic work-up of non-responding patient with pneumonia

Review of patient medical history

In the setting of treatment failure, revisiting the patient's medical history can be especially useful both for identifying a possible overlooked infectious cause of pneumonia or to identify risks factors that could indicate the presence of a highly resistant organism. For example, prior animal exposures or travel history could provide clues to the presence of a rare cause of pneumonia (Fig. 2). A history, or known colonisation on surveillance swabs, of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, and receipt of intravenous antibiotics within the past 30 days should raise suspicion for a possible MDR pathogen causing pneumonia.

### How important is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia and what is best antimicrobial therapy? [^11699EuG]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The emergence of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus has raised issues regarding the importance of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and its optimal treatment. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is an important cause of CAP because of the high mortality if not suspected early, and its occurrence in young patients with long life expectancy. Certain clinical features can increase the probability of CA-MRSA as a cause of CAP. The consistent trend toward better outcomes for documented MRSA pneumonia suggests that linezolid be considered the drug of choice for documented MRSA CAP, especially for CA-MRSA.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

Results

The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.

Conclusions

In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00729937.).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113nTgUs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Comparing the cost-effectiveness of linezolid to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: a healthcare system perspective [^114HnjkD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Few industry-independent studies have been conducted to compare the relative costs and benefits of drugs to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. We performed a stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatment strategies-linezolid versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin-for the treatment of MRSA infection.

Methods

We used cost and effectiveness data from a previously conducted clinical trial, complementing with other data from published literature, to compare the two regimens from a healthcare system perspective. Effectiveness was expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Several sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation, to measure the effect of potential parameter changes on the base-case model results, including potential differences related to type of infection and drug toxicity.

Results

Treatment of MRSA infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin and linezolid were found to cost on average €146 and €2536, and lead to a gain of 0.916 and 0.881 QALYs, respectively. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was found to be more cost-effective than linezolid in the base case and remained dominant over linezolid in most alternative scenarios, including different types of MRSA infection and potential disadvantages in terms of toxicity. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0, €50 000 and €200 000 per QALY gained, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was dominant in 100%, 96% and 85% of model iterations. A 95% discount on the current purchasing price of linezolid would be needed when it goes off-patent for it to represent better value for money compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin.

Conclusions

Combined treatment of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin is more cost-effective than linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infection.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^114b2STY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric Staphylococcus aureus coverage and MRSA risk factors: The panel recommend that all empiric regimens include an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus, and the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Although 10% (95% CI 6%–14%) of HAP cases are attributable to MRSA, this was insufficient justification to target MRSA in all HAP patients. Factors that probably increase MRSA risk include prior known MRSA colonization detected via nasal or respiratory cultures or nonculture screening, a high-quality Gram stain showing numerous and predominant gram-positive cocci in clusters, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant or the prevalence is not known (with the 20% threshold arbitrarily chosen), and intravenous antibiotic treatment during the prior 90 days. When MRSA coverage is chosen, the guideline panel prefers vancomycin or linezolid, noting similar clinical outcomes and that final choice rests on blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^1164jsq8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Travelers' Diarrhea in Adults

For the treatment of travelers' diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new bug, old drugs [^112c1dXv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections and evaluate older antibiotics as suitable therapeutic treatment options.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1966-May 2006) were performed using the key terms methicillin resistance, community-acquired, community associated, treatment, Staphylococcus aureus, mec, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles were critically evaluated and all relevant information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

There has been a documented shift of methicillin resistance occurring in staphylococcal infections manifested within the community. Infections caused by CA-MRSA possess unique characteristics including lack of hospital-associated risk factors, improved susceptibility patterns, distinct genotypes, faster doubling times, and additional toxins. Potential therapeutic options to treat these infections include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and new antimicrobials.

Conclusions

CA-MRSA infections can be successfully treated with older, oral antibiotic agents including TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and tetracyclines. Fluoroquinolones and linezolid should be avoided as first-line agents.

### Treatment options for nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA [^116DT7cG]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Nosocomial pneumonia, which includes hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and health care associated pneumonia, remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The continuing emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a nosocomial pneumonia pathogen is particularly problematic not only because of its prevalence, but also because antimicrobial resistance is increasingly associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. As a result, intensivists are faced with the dual goals of providing initial accurate broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage to reduce mortality while minimizing the risk for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. These competing goals can be achieved by using an approach that initially delivers liberal broad-spectrum coverage followed by de-escalation once culture results and serial clinical observations become available. In ventilator-associated pneumonia, linezolid has demonstrated favorable activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, and is recommended in evidence-based guidelines as an alternative to vancomycin, particularly when MRSA is documented as the etiology.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — S. aureus coverage and MRSA/MSSA selection is as follows: For patients being treated empirically for HAP, we recommend prescribing an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA, and when empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^111WBvdJ]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We found no significant differences with regard to the pre-defined secondary outcomes (table 2). Persistence of bacteraemia was slightly more common with vancomycin at 48 hours and with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at seven days. There was no significant difference in length of hospital admission for patients discharged alive. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency. Renal failure at day 7 and day 30 was slightly more common with vancomycin, but this was not statistically significant (table 3).

Table 3
Adverse events. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

Variables significantly associated with the primary outcome on univariate analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. McCabe score, presence of nasogastric tube or urine catheter at onset of infection, white blood count, and albumin concentrations were associated with treatment failure but correlated with other included variables and were not entered into the regression analysis. Other significant variables are shown in table 4. On multivariable analysis, allocation to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly associated with treatment failure (adjusted odds ratio 2.00, 1.09 to 3.65). Other independent risk factors were bacteraemia and mechanical ventilation at infection onset; surgery in the 30 days before infection was inversely associated with treatment failure.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — MSSA-directed empiric and targeted therapy: Patients with HAP who have no risk factors for either MRSA infection or a poor clinical outcome may receive an empiric regimen that includes an antibiotic targeting MSSA. Some agents used for HAP due to activity against P. aeruginosa and gram-negative bacilli are also suitable for empiric MSSA coverage — these include piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem — and an empiric regimen that includes one of these does not require an additional MSSA agent. If infection with MSSA alone is confirmed, oxacillin, nafcillin, and cefazolin are narrow-spectrum intravenous antibiotics that are optimal for treating MSSA.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP empiric threshold setting — example based on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) prevalence is as follows: To minimize inappropriate broad-spectrum coverage, the panel considered the number needed to treat; if the average prevalence of S. aureus in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is approximately 25%, then a methicillin resistance rate of 10%–20% implies that only 2.5%–5% of VAPs will be due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), so most patients will not benefit from MRSA coverage, although higher MRSA prevalence increases benefit; the panel notes that individual units can adjust thresholds and calls for further research on optimal cutoffs.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

Conclusions

Methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) constitutes a significant epidemiological problem in cases of hospital-treated pneumonia. The findings were similar for LTCF, where MRSA appears to affect male residents in particular, although there were fewer male residents than female residents. The low sensitivity to TMP/SXT of SA strains isolated from the oldest patients indicates potentially serious challenges pertaining to efficacious treatment of SA infections.

### Host-dependent resistance of group A Streptococcus to sulfamethoxazole mediated by a horizontally-acquired reduced folate transporter [^116v1Zqo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global human health that was recently estimated to directly cause 1.27 million deaths per year. Genomic surveillance of AMR is one of the strategies outlined by the World Health Organization to mitigate the burden of AMR infections and guide the optimal use of existing antibiotics. Surveillance is facilitated by online databases of AMR genes and mutations, each of which have been defined by their ability to confer direct resistance to antibiotics in vitro. These generally fall into four canonical mechanisms: antibiotic inactivation, reduced antibiotic accumulation, target expression changes, and target protection (including acquisition of functional targets with reduced antibiotic affinity) –. While new antibiotic resistance genes are continually being identified, the underlying mechanisms of resistance almost exclusively fall into these four canonical mechanisms. However, existing AMR genes and mutations do not explain all antibiotic-resistant infections.

The folate biosynthesis pathway has been a target for antibiotic therapy for over 80 years. The end products of this pathway, 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF), are key intermediates in the folate cycle that is required for production of deoxythymidine monophosphate. As mammals lack the enzymes required for de novo folate synthesis, they must acquire reduced folate cycle intermediates from dietary sources. The most common antifolate antibiotic therapy is a highly synergistic combination of two antibiotics that simultaneously inhibit de novo folate synthesis (sulfamethoxazole, SMX) and the folate cycle (trimethoprim, TMP; Fig. 1). This combination (co-trimoxazole, SXT) is commonly used to treat a variety of infections that include community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative urinary tract, and Pneumocystis pneumonia infections. After promising clinical trial results, SXT is now recommended to treat Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) skin infections in endemic settings.

### Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis [^1149R1ni]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as, not only an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer people with cystic fibrosis with a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including P aeruginosa) or increased adverse effects from drugs, or both.

Search Methods

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE, clinical trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN Registry), handsearching article reference lists and through contact with experts in the field. Date of the last search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 27 July 2017. Ongoing trials registries were last searched: 07 August 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials with the primary aim of eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently assessed all search results for eligibility. They used the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

The review includes two trials with a total of 106 participants with MRSA infection. In both trials the active treatment was oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin; however, one trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. In both trials the control arm was observation only. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with CF as an outcome; however, the definition used for MRSA eradication differed. The first trial (n = 45) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that, when compared to control, oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures, odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence); however, by day 168 of follow-up there was no difference in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative in either treatment arm, OR 1.17 (95% CI 0.31 to 4.42) (low-quality evidence). In the second trial, successful eradication was defined as the absence of MRSA following treatment (oral co-trimoxazole and rifampicin with intranasal mupirocin or observation) in at least three cultures over a period of six months. At the time of reporting, 40 out of 61 participants had completed follow-up, but results showed no difference between groups. Eradication was achieved in 12 out 29 participants (41%) receiving active treatment, and in 9 out of 32 participants (28%) on the observation arm, OR 1.80 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.25) (very low-quality evidence). With regards to this review's secondary outcomes, these were reported in the first trial only. The trial reports that no differences were observed between the two arms in terms of pulmonary exacerbations (from screening to day 28), nasal colonisation, lung function, weight or participant-reported outcomes. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control, rate ratio 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.72) (P = 0.0102).

Authors' Conclusions

Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, by six months, the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative did not differ between treatment arms in either trial. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care, remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design and unclear detail reported in one trial. Based on the available evidence, it is the opinion of the authors that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

Empiric antibiotic coverage for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against MRSA only when there is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance, when units have > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates methicillin resistant, or when MRSA prevalence is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and not MRSA when patients lack risk factors for antimicrobial resistance and are treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). When empiric treatment should include MSSA coverage, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for proven MSSA but are not necessary for empiric VAP if one of the above agents is used.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^114QfSin]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Which Empirical Antimicrobial Agents Are Preferred for Osteomyelitis?

Based on data from observational studies, if antibiotic therapy cannot be delayed until culture availability, it is reasonable to empirically cover aerobic gram-positive cocci, especially S aureus, and gram-negative bacilli (Table 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Many practitioners routinely provide anaerobic coverage for DFO; however, comparative data are not available to establish the clinical benefit or harm of this approach. Inclusion of empirical therapy targeting methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on the presence of specific risk factors (addressed below). In all cases, local susceptibility patterns, patient-specific risk factors, and prior culture data influence the choice of antibiotic selection. Culture results can be used to tailor empirical therapy when possible.

Table 2.
Reasonable Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy Options With Published Data a

Abbreviations: PJI, prosthetic joint infection; TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Targeting MRSA Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, inclusion of empirical anti-MRSA coverage depends on local prevalence and patient-specific risk factors, such as known colonization status (which is the biggest individual risk factor), prior positive cultures, and health care exposure. In a setting with low MRSA incidence, no known MRSA colonization or prior positive cultures, and minimal health care contact, it is reasonable to withhold empirical MRSA coverage.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Against P Aeruginosa Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, routine use of empirical antipseudomonal therapy for osteomyelitis is unnecessary. Such agents are added in the presence of specific risk factors, including patients with chronic wounds who have: (1) been exposed to multiple prior courses of antibiotics; (2) previously had cultures positive for P aeruginosa; (3) gangrenous wounds; (4) had a recent surgical procedure (eg, within 3 months, as with early PJI); or (5) specific sites of infection particularly associated with pseudomonal infection (eg, malignant otitis externa).

Does Bone Penetration of an Antimicrobial Agent Matter Clinically, and Should It Be Used to Select Therapy?

Outcome data related to antibiotic bone penetration are limited for osteomyelitis. Thus, theoretical bone penetration (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) is not the primary driver of antibiotic selection; published clinical outcomes data are more relevant.

Risk of acquisition of MRSA during hospitalization varies but is generally uncommon if good infection prevention practices are in place. The negative predictive value of MRSA nasal swabs (via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture) is high; thus, if the MRSA nasal screening test is negative then it is reasonable to either discontinue or forgo the addition of anti-MRSA empiric therapy.

One additional caveat regarding non-responders relates to appropriate drug and adequate dose of antibiotics. For example, if vancomycin is prescribed for MRSA, but therapeutic levels take 4 days to achieve, one could see a clinical decline or non-response to treatment. Similarly, if daptomycin was started for other reasons, it would not be expected to cover a secondary pneumonia with MRSA because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Underdosing of beta-lactam antibiotics directed at Gram-negative organisms occurs frequently, although patients in the ICU with sepsis have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can result in increased clearance of antibiotics. For these reasons, many ICUs preferentially administer beta-lactam agents via continuous or extended infusion.

### Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 μ g / mL to vancomycin: old (trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole) versus new (daptomycin or linezolid) agents [^116vqEwV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that agents other than vancomycin be considered for some types of infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to vancomycin is 2 μg/mL or more. Alternative therapeutic options include daptomycin and linezolid, 2 relatively new and expensive drugs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), an old and inexpensive agent.

Objective

To compare the clinical efficacy and potential cost savings associated with use of TMP/SMX compared to linezolid and daptomycin.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted at Detroit Medical Center. For calendar year 2009, unique adults (age > 18 years) with infections due to MRSA with an MIC to vancomycin of 2 μg/mL were included if they received 2 or more doses of TMP/SMX and/or daptomycin and/or linezolid. Data were abstracted from patient charts and pharmacy records.

Results

There were 328 patients included in the study cohort: 143 received TMP/SMX alone, 89 received daptomycin alone, 75 received linezolid alone, and 21 patients received a combination of 2 or more of these agents. In univariate analysis, patients who received TMP/SMX alone had significantly better outcomes, including in-hospital (p = 0.003) and 90-day mortality (p < 0.001) compared to patients treated with daptomycin or linezolid. Patients receiving TMP/SMX were also younger (p < 0.001), had fewer comorbid conditions (p < 0.001), had less severe acute severity of illness (p < 0.001), and received appropriate therapy more rapidly (p = 0.001). In multivariate models the association between TMP/SMX treatment and mortality was no longer significant. Antimicrobial cost savings associated with using TMP/SMX averaged $2067.40 per patient.

Conclusions

TMP/SMX monotherapy compared favorably to linezolid and daptomycin in terms of treatment efficacy and mortality. Use of TMP/SMX instead of linezolid or daptomycin could potentially significantly reduce antibiotic costs. TMP/SMX should be considered for the treatment of MRSA infection with MIC of 2 μg/mL to vancomycin.

### Ceftobiprole compared with vancomycin plus aztreonam in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial (TARGET) [^115zPeYC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The safety findings of ceftobiprole in this study were consistent with its established safety profile, including that reported in previous studies in cSSTIs and pneumonia. The most common AEs were related to gastrointestinal disorders and less than 2% of patients experienced AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, suggesting that ceftobiprole is well tolerated in the majority of patients.

When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America include several antibacterial options, such as vancomycin, linezolid, clindamycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, or telavancin, with specific recommendations varying depending on the severity of infection and type of ABSSSI. Since these guidelines were issued in 2014, additional agents have become available, including tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and delafloxacin. With the exception of delafloxacin, these agents are all indicated in gram-positive infections only. Our study results, together with previous studies with ceftobiprole in this setting, suggest that ceftobiprole has the potential to be an effective broad-spectrum treatment option for ABSSSIs, with suitability for use in those with gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, or mixed gram-positive/gram-negative infections. Unlike with vancomycin, monitoring of serum trough concentrations is not required with ceftobiprole, which may help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^115amEW2]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Appropriate initial antibiotics were received by 32 patients (72.7%) in the de-escalation group and 63 patients (67.7%) in the non-de-escalation group (P = 0.55). Twelve patients in the de-escalation group received initial inappropriate therapy. Three patients did not receive anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) antimicrobial therapy after the identification of MRSA. The therapy of three other patients was altered to include trimethoprim and sulfomethoxazole (TMP/SMX) because they had Sternotrophomonas maltophilia. Two patients showed resistance to the initial antibiotics, and four patients presented with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

The rate of nonpneumonia infection during treatment of ICU-acquired pneumonia was 31.8% (14 of 44 patients) in the de-escalation group and 23.7% (22 of 93 patients) in the non-de-escalation group (P = 0.31). The median timing of de-escalation was 5.5 days. The mean modified 5-day CPIS and 5-day APACHE II score for all patients are summarized in Table 2. The mean changes in CPIS (from the day of diagnosis of pneumonia to day 5 after the diagnosis of pneumonia) in the de-escalation and non-de-escalation groups were 1.8 ± 1.8 and 1.2 ± 1.6, respectively (P = 0.7).

### Low-dose vs Conventional-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in Patients not infected with HIV: a multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study [^111fPjMB]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is an effective treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients with and without HIV infection; however, a high incidence of adverse events has been observed. Low-dose TMP-SMX is a potentially effective treatment with fewer adverse events; however, evidence is limited.

Research Question

What is the efficacy and safety of low-dose TMP-SMX for non-HIV PCP compared with conventional-dose TMP-SMX after adjusting for patient background characteristics?

Study Design and Methods

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included patients diagnosed with non-HIV PCP and treated with TMP-SMX between June 2006 and March 2021 at three institutions. The patients were classified into low-dose (TMP < 12.5 mg/kg/d) and conventional-dose (TMP 12.5–20 mg/kg/d) groups. The primary end point was 30-day mortality, and the secondary end points were 180-day mortality, adverse events grade 3 or higher per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, and initial treatment completion rates. Background characteristics were adjusted using the overlap weighting method with propensity scores.

Results

Fifty-five patients in the low-dose group and 81 in the conventional-dose group were evaluated. In the overall cohort, the average age was 70.7 years, and the proportion of women was 55.1%. The average dose of TMP-SMX was 8.71 mg/kg/d in the low-dose group and 17.78 mg/kg/d in the conventional-dose group. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (6.7% vs 18.4%, respectively; p = 0.080) or 180-day mortality (14.6% vs 26.1%, respectively; p = 0.141) after adjusting for patient background characteristics. The incidence of adverse events, especially nausea and hyponatremia, was significantly lower in the low-dose group (29.8% vs 59.0%, respectively; p = 0.005). The initial treatment completion rates were 43.3% and 29.6% in the low-dose and conventional-dose groups (P = 0.158), respectively.

Interpretation

Survival was similar between the low-dose and conventional-dose TMP-SMX groups, and low-dose TMP-SMX was associated with reduced adverse events in patients with non-HIV PCP.

### Mrsa bone and joint… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response. Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks.

For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. MRSA Pneumonia PNEUMONIA Empiric therapy for MRSA is recommended, pending sputum and/or blood culture results, for hospitalized patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia defined by one of the following: a requirement for admission to the intensive care unit, necrotizing or cavitary infiltrates, or empyema. Treatment options for health care–associated MRSA or community-associated MRSA pneumonia include seven to 21 days of intravenous vancomycin or linezolid, or clindamycin if the strain is susceptible. CHILDREN In children, intravenous vancomycin is recommended for treating MRSA pneumonia.

If the patient is stable without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection, clindamycin can be used as empiric therapy if the clindamycin resistance rate is low. Patients can be transitioned to oral therapy if the strain is susceptible. Linezolid is an alternative option. Some experts recommend adding oral rifampin to the chosen antibiotic. For patients with concurrent bacteremia, rifampin should be added after bacteremia has cleared.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^113BHvRB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

S. aureus treatments such as antistaphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins, U. S. physicians have prescribed a variety of other antibiotics to treat these infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. A retrospective review showed TMP/SMX to be effective for skin and soft-tissue infections. However, because TMP/SMX may inadequately treat group A streptococci, combining it with another antimicrobial may be preferred when the specific organism is unknown.

The ideal dosage of TMP/SMX for treating community-acquired MRSA is unknown, although one small study reported higher success rates when two double-strength pills were given twice daily, compared with one pill twice daily. Parenteral therapy is available for serious community-acquired MRSA infections. Vancomycin remains the first choice for MRSA therapy. There have been reports of resistance to vancomycin through a heteroresistance mechanism, but this is not easily identified with clinical microbiology testing and requires special detection techniques. Although daptomycin has not been widely studied for treatment of community-acquired MRSA, it has recently been approved for treating bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis caused by. S. aureus*. However, MRSA strains with heteroresistance to vancomycin may exhibit a similar effect with daptomycin.

Daptomycin should also be avoided in patients with community-acquired MRSA-associated pneumonia because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Linezolid has been demonstrated to be effective in MRSA infections in clinical controlled trials. It may be especially useful in serious skin and soft-tissue infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, because of its ability to inhibit toxin production. However, a reasonable alternative would be to use vancomycin with clindamycin for this purpose.

### Empirical anti-MRSA vs standard antibiotic therapy and risk of mortality in patients with pneumonia… [^111TyunU]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

aStandard antibiotics were defined as either a β-lactam plus macrolide or tetracycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. β-Lactams included nonpseudomonals. The association of empirical anti-MRSA therapy with outcomes among patients with pneumonia is unknown, even for high-risk patients.

The primary exposure of interest was treatment with anti-MRSA therapy plus guideline-recommended standard antibiotics 14, 20 vs standard therapy alone. Because many patients received anti-MRSA therapy without standard antibiotics, we also evaluated this strategy as an additional treatment group. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality within 30 days of hospitalization. Death data were obtained from the VA Vital Status file., 1. 2; 95% CI,

1. 1–1. 4), and with positive results of surveillance PCR but no significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality for patients with positive results of clinical culture. Similar associations were found for the group receiving anti-MRSA therapy without standard therapy.

With a mortality rate that has not substantially improved in decades, the threat of resistant organisms, and the emphasis on timely antibiotics in sepsis, it is not surprising that the strategy of early broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia has become the norm. The underlying assumption of this approach is that the benefit of more potent antibiotics during the empirical phase exceeds the harms. Our study questions this assumption. We hope that newer diagnostic approaches44–46 and more evidence informing antimicrobial decisions will enhance our ability to accurately treat our patients. In the meantime, administration of empirical anti-MRSA therapy for pneumonia using current approaches should be reconsidered, even in high-risk patients.

### Cotrimoxazole versus vancomycin for invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections… [^116TWKPk]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

It is a last resort antibiotic family that should be reserved for the future; Vancomycin is less effective that beta-lactam drugs for SA infections susceptible to both agents; treatment can only be given intravenously; and use of vancomycin has led to the development of SA strains with partial or complete resistance to vancomycin. Cotrimoxazole is an old antibiotic active against most strains of MRSA, depending on local epidemiology. Study hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to show that cotrimoxazole is as effective as treatment with vancomycin for invasive MRSA infections. We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with cotrimoxazole vs. vancomycin for invasive MRSA infections.

The primary efficacy outcome we will assess will be Improvement or cure with or without antibiotic modifications, defined as: survival at 7 days post randomization with resolution of fever and resolution of hypotension; and physician's assessment that the primary infection was improved or cured. The primary safety outcome will be all-cause 30-day survival. Cotrimoxazole is a relatively 'old' drug commonly used for urinary tract infections. Invitro, it is active against SA, including methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus strains and its activity against SA is bactericidal. Trimethoprim alone is bactericidal against SA, while sulphamethoxazole alone is relatively inactive and their combination is synergistic both in-vitro and invivo. The prevalence of cotrimoxazole-susceptible SA varies locally.

At our center, 97% of SA strains causing bacteremia in 2004 were susceptible to cotrimoxazole. Community-acquired MRSA, prevalent in the United States as a cause for severe skin and soft tissue infections, has not been described in Israel. Several reasons exist to search for antibiotics other than vancomycin for MRSA infections. Vancomycin is less effective that beta-lactam drugs for SA infections susceptible to both agents. It is the last resort antibiotic for MRSA infections out of the currently recommended bactericidal antibiotics for invasive infections. Use of vancomycin has led to the development of SA strains with partial or complete resistance to vancomycin.
