## Question

What is the recommended treatment for tonsillitis in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for tonsillitis in adults, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and key decision points. Then, I should verify how to assess pretest probability and whether to test for group A streptococcus. Next, I will examine the role of rapid antigen testing versus culture in adults and when each is appropriate. After that, I should determine when to treat versus observe, select the antibiotic and regimen if indicated, and consider alternatives in penicillin allergy. Then, I need to appraise adjunctive therapies like corticosteroids and address the question of recurrent disease and surgical thresholds. Finally, I will reconcile any guideline differences, flag red flags and complications, and close with a practical algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and core decision points: an adult with acute tonsillitis, typically presenting with sore throat, dysphagia, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy, and the central task is to distinguish viral etiologies (most cases) from bacterial, especially group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, because only the latter meaningfully benefits from antibiotics and carries complications we want to prevent [^112BrrDu] [^117St1Y4].

> I need to check pretest probability using validated clinical rules; the modified Centor score assigns one point each for fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, and absence of cough, and the higher the score, the higher the likelihood of GABHS and the stronger the indication to test rather than treat empirically, which helps curb unnecessary antibiotics and resistance [^113SCypi] [^111oj5uS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing strategy; I should confirm the diagnostic pathway. For adults with 0–1 Centor features, the likelihood of GABHS is low and I should avoid testing and antibiotics, favoring supportive care only, whereas for 2–4 features I should obtain a rapid antigen detection test and treat only if positive, given RADTs have good specificity but only about 70–90% sensitivity and culture is not routinely required for confirmation of negatives in adults, unlike children [^113SCypi] [^111RUTM1] [^112BrrDu].

> Wait, let me verify a common point of confusion: some clinicians reflexively send throat cultures for negative RADTs in adults; I initially thought that might be necessary, but that reflects pediatric practice where culture back-up is advised, not adult practice, so I should correct that and avoid routine cultures in adults unless there is an outbreak or atypical presentation suggesting alternative pathogens [^113noMib] [^111RUTM1].

> Next, I should review treatment thresholds and options if RADT is positive or suspicion remains very high with 3–4 Centor features; penicillin or amoxicillin remain first-line given narrow spectrum, low cost, and absence of resistance, with 10 days of penicillin V as a traditional standard and amoxicillin 775 mg once daily noninferior in labeled studies, while acknowledging that some guidelines still anchor to 10 days to maximize eradication [^113SCypi] [^116eLGvN] [^113d21E2].

> I will now examine regimen nuances and alternatives; let me consider shorter courses. A 5-day penicillin V regimen at 800 mg four times daily was noninferior to 10 days in a randomized trial for GABHS pharyngotonsillitis, though bacteriologic eradication favored the 10-day arm and many experts still prefer 10 days when adherence is likely, so I should tailor duration to severity, adherence risk, and patient preference while discussing trade-offs [^114xemQF] [^113CsrQF].

> For penicillin allergy, I should confirm the allergy phenotype; with nonanaphylactic reactions, a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefadroxil 1 g daily for 10 days is reasonable, whereas with anaphylaxis I should avoid beta-lactams and use agents like clindamycin or azithromycin, keeping in mind rising macrolide resistance in some regions and that azithromycin's shorter 5-day course is not clearly superior for eradication in adults compared with penicillin [^113noMib] [^114jXXFm] [^1114tRLB] [^114AaBsW].

> But wait, what if symptoms are severe and the patient needs faster pain relief; I should consider a single low-dose corticosteroid such as dexamethasone 10 mg oral or IM as an adjunct to standard care, which doubles the chance of complete pain resolution at 24 hours and accelerates onset of relief by several hours, without a signal for serious adverse events in trials, though I should avoid repeated steroid dosing and use caution in patients with diabetes or immunosuppression [^114dQPo6] [^115rpVFB] [^113GTnrG].

> Let me think about when not to treat; antibiotics offer only modest average symptom benefit and do not change the fact that most sore throats resolve spontaneously by day 7–10, so I should emphasize hydration, analgesics, and rest for low-risk adults, and if antibiotics are prescribed, I should explain the limited magnitude of benefit to align expectations and minimize overuse [^116NcnPh] [^116kw671].

> Now, I should review the recurrent tonsillitis pathway; I need to ensure that we are not overcalling recurrences and that we document episodes rigorously. The "Paradise" thresholds used to frame decisions are at least 7 episodes in 1 year, 5 per year for 2 years, or 3 per year for 3 years, and for adults, emerging randomized evidence suggests that immediate tonsillectomy reduces sore throat days by about half over 24 months compared with conservative care, with bleeding risk around 19% but high patient-reported satisfaction, which supports shared decision-making for appropriately selected adults after a period of observation and documentation [^112BrrDu] [^1135bRHv].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuance on surgery for mildly recurrent disease; earlier systematic reviews found only modest short-term benefits of tonsillectomy in adults with limited follow-up, and the 2023 NATTINA trial is the pivotal adult RCT showing larger, durable reductions in sore throat days, so I should frame older negative or neutral conclusions in light of newer high-quality evidence when counseling patients [^1139QbJo] [^1135bRHv].

> Let me reconsider the comparative effectiveness of tonsillotomy versus tonsillectomy; in adults prioritizing quicker recovery and less postoperative pain, laser tonsillotomy under local anesthesia yields faster functional recovery than complete tonsillectomy under general anesthesia, but at the cost of lower rates of complete symptom resolution and a possible need for secondary procedures, so patient values should drive modality selection [^114jcg9B] [^114Nqu6T] [^113XdxGT].

> Next, I should review complications and red flags; peritonsillar abscess is uncommon but important, and although immediate tonsillectomy is highly effective, it carries more bleeding than local drainage, so I should tailor management to severity, airway risk, and resources, with drainage under local anesthesia as a reasonable initial approach in many settings and tonsillectomy reserved for recurrence or failed drainage [^114yNy6f].

> I need to ensure I reconcile guideline differences; European guidelines often de-emphasize testing and antibiotics in adults due to low complication rates and high spontaneous resolution, whereas North American guidelines prioritize microbiologic confirmation and antibiotics to prevent suppurative complications and rare rheumatic sequelae, so local epidemiology and patient risk should guide the balance between test-and-treat and watchful-waiting approaches [^111oj5uS] [^116HrY17] [^111RUTM1].

> Finally, I should double-check that my algorithm is coherent: assess Centor features, avoid testing and antibiotics if 0–1, test adults with 2–4 features and treat only if RADT is positive, choose penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days or a validated 5-day penicillin V regimen if adherence is a concern, adjust for penicillin allergy phenotype, consider a single dose of corticosteroid for severe pain, reserve surgery for documented recurrent disease after observation and discuss tonsillotomy versus tonsillectomy trade-offs, all while reinforcing supportive care and antibiotic stewardship principles [^113SCypi] [^114xemQF] [^114dQPo6] [^1135bRHv] [^112BrrDu].

Treat tonsillitis in adults with **supportive care** (analgesics, hydration, rest) for most cases, as most are viral and self-limited [^117St1Y4]. Use **antibiotics only** when GAS is confirmed or strongly suspected (Centor/McIsaac ≥ 3) [^113SCypi], with penicillin or amoxicillin first-line for 10 days [^111oj5uS]; use cefadroxil [^1114tRLB] or cefuroxime [^1171B91i] for non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, and azithromycin or clindamycin for anaphylaxis. Avoid **routine corticosteroids** [^113noMib] unless pain is severe and short-course steroids are considered after weighing risks [^113GTnrG]. Consider tonsillectomy for documented recurrent infections (≥ 7/year, ≥ 5/year for 2 years, or ≥ 3/year for 3 years) or complications (e.g. peritonsillar abscess) [^112BrrDu] [^1178LwzC]. Educate on hygiene, symptom control, and red flags (airway compromise, drooling, severe dysphagia, persistent fever) that require urgent care.

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis guides therapy: **clinical assessment** uses Centor or McIsaac criteria (fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, absence of cough) to estimate GAS risk and decide on testing and treatment [^113SCypi]. Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is performed in adults with Centor/McIsaac ≥ 2, with antibiotics reserved for positive results; routine throat culture is not recommended in adults [^113SCypi].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone for viral tonsillitis and mild bacterial cases: **analgesics and antipyretics** such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen reduce pain and fever; **hydration** with adequate fluids prevents dehydration; and **rest** supports recovery.

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated only for confirmed or strongly suspected GAS infection [^113SCypi]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | First-line | 500 mg PO BID-TID | 10 days [^111oj5uS] |
| Amoxicillin | Alternative first-line | 500 mg PO TID or 775 mg ER PO QD | 10 days [^111oj5uS] |
| Cefadroxil | Non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy | 1 g PO QD-BID | 10 days [^1114tRLB] |
| Cefuroxime | Non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy | 250 mg PO BID | 10 days [^notfound] |
| Azithromycin | Anaphylactic penicillin allergy | 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg PO QD days 2–5 | 5 days |
| Clindamycin | Anaphylactic penicillin allergy | 300 mg PO TID | 10 days |

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Corticosteroids may be considered for severe pain in adults after weighing risks; **single-dose dexamethasone** can reduce pain and shorten time to pain relief [^113GTnrG] [^114dQPo6]. Local anesthetics (e.g. benzocaine or lidocaine gargles) provide short-term pain relief but should be used cautiously to avoid aspiration.

---

## Indications for tonsillectomy

Surgery is reserved for recurrent or complicated disease: **recurrent infections** are defined as ≥ 7/year, ≥ 5/year for 2 years, or ≥ 3/year for 3 years with documentation and qualifying features (fever, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or positive GAS test) [^112qqLdB]. Complications such as peritonsillar abscess, airway obstruction, or persistent GAS carriage despite antibiotics also warrant surgery [^1178LwzC].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Education should emphasize hygiene, symptom control, and red flags (airway compromise, drooling, severe dysphagia, persistent fever) that require urgent care [^notfound]. Follow-up should reassess at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, **reconsider the diagnosis**, assess adherence, or evaluate for complications.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Supportive care**: First-line for all patients.
- **Antibiotics**: Use only for confirmed or strongly suspected GAS; penicillin or amoxicillin first-line.
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider corticosteroids for severe pain; local anesthetics for short-term relief.
- **Tonsillectomy**: For recurrent infections or complications.
- **Patient education**: Emphasize hygiene, symptom control, and red flags.

---

Treat tonsillitis in adults with supportive care as the foundation, reserving antibiotics for confirmed or strongly suspected GAS, and consider tonsillectomy for recurrent or complicated disease.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^1139QbJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults. We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period. When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence). Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence). When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality. Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics. Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion. The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^111oj5uS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^112BrrDu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^113zrmde]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation but the indications for surgery are controversial.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery. Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected. For more severely affected children adeno-/tonsillectomy will avoid three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat, including one episode of moderate or severe sore throat in the next year. The cost of this is a predictable episode of pain in the immediate postoperative period. Less severely affected children may never have had another severe sore throat anyway and the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of two rather than three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat. The cost of this reduction is one inevitable and predictable episode of postoperative pain. The 'average' patient will have 17 rather than 22 sore throat days but some of these 17 days (between five and seven) will be in the immediate postoperative period. Whilst the concept of the 'average' patient is attractive, in practice, wide variability is likely. One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest, is that many untreated patients get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties: what proportion of my throat symptoms are attributable to my tonsils, and will I get better without any treatment? Similarly, the potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throats in children, the gain being more marked in those most severely affected. The size of the effect is modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of it. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.

### Tonsillitis [^112ajYBc]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^113SCypi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed.2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered.5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113F4qLU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — scope and limitations state that the guideline is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance and is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies, is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals and may not provide the only appropriate approach, and that clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals that are not absolute; guidelines are not mandates, do not purport to be a legal standard of care, and the responsible physician must determine the appropriate treatment based on the individual patient.

### Extracts from the cochrane library: tonsillectomy for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^1146YbPr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a quarterly section in the Journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to highlight implications for clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane Review entitled "Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis", which concludes modest efficacy in children for sore throat days and episodes, with greater benefit for those with more severe illness.

### Conservative management versus tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis in the UK (NATTINA): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^1135bRHv]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is regularly performed in adults with acute tonsillitis, but with scarce evidence. A reduction in tonsillectomies has coincided with an increase in acute adult hospitalisation for tonsillitis complications. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of conservative management versus tonsillectomy in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Methods

This pragmatic multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted in 27 hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults aged 16 years or older who were newly referred to secondary care otolaryngology clinics with recurrent acute tonsillitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tonsillectomy or conservative management using random permuted blocks of variable length. Stratification by recruiting centre and baseline symptom severity was assessed using the Tonsil Outcome Inventory-14 score (categories defined as mild 0–35, moderate 36–48, or severe 49–70). Participants in the tonsillectomy group received elective surgery to dissect the palatine tonsils within 8 weeks after random assignment and those in the conservative management group received standard non-surgical care during 24 months. The primary outcome was the number of sore throat days collected during 24 months after random assignment, reported once per week with a text message. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 55284102.

Findings

Between May 11, 2015, and April 30, 2018, 4165 participants with recurrent acute tonsillitis were assessed for eligibility and 3712 were excluded. 453 eligible participants were randomly assigned (233 in the immediate tonsillectomy group vs 220 in the conservative management group). 429 (95%) patients were included in the primary ITT analysis (224 vs 205). The median age of participants was 23 years (IQR 19–30), with 355 (78%) females and 97 (21%) males. Most participants were White (407 [90%]). Participants in the immediate tonsillectomy group had fewer days of sore throat during 24 months than those in the conservative management group (median 23 days [IQR 11–46] vs 30 days [14–65]). After adjustment for site and baseline severity, the incident rate ratio of total sore throat days in the immediate tonsillectomy group (n = 224) compared with the conservative management group (n = 205) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.65; < 0.0001). 191 adverse events in 90 (39%) of 231 participants were deemed related to tonsillectomy. The most common adverse event was bleeding (54 events in 44 [19%] participants). No deaths occurred during the study.

Interpretation

Compared with conservative management, immediate tonsillectomy is clinically effective and cost-effective in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113CsrQF]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Does the choice of antibiotic affect outcome in strep throat? [^1152TGdN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is insufficient evidence to show clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for group A beta hemolytic streptococci tonsillopharyngitis. Penicillin or amoxicillin is recommended as first choice, given the absence of resistance and low cost.

### Recurrent throat infections (tonsillitis) [^112iL4tR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, cold steel tonsillectomy, diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (−0.4 to −21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.

Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.

### Amoxicillin (Moxatag) [^1111hcv5]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients 12 years or older. (1)

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1112P85x]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Statement 3 — tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors: Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess; the recommendation is based on randomized controlled trials and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114ZVvvc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — evidence-based statement categories define three levels with corresponding implied obligations: Strong recommendation — A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation — A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as high, and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option — An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111h4gkF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence "suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer". In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, "the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up", whereas controls had "a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year". For moderate or severe episodes, controls had "1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group".

### Differences among international pharyngitis guidelines: not just academic [^116HrY17]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many countries have national guidelines for the treatment of pharyngitis. We wanted to compare the recommendations and the reported evidence in national guidelines for the management of acute sore throat in adults.

Methods

Guidelines were retrieved via MEDLINE and EMBASE and through a Web-based search for guideline development organizations. The content of the recommendations and the underlying evidence were analyzed with qualitative and bibliometric methods.

Results

We included 4 North American and 6 European guidelines. Recommendations differ with regard to the use of a rapid antigen test and throat culture and with the indication for antibiotics. The North American, French, and Finnish guidelines consider diagnosis of group A streptococcus essential, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever remains an important reason to prescribe antibiotics. In 4 of the 6 European guidelines, acute sore throat is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not recommended. The evidence used to underpin these guidelines was different in North America and Europe. North American guidelines cited more North American references than did European guidelines (87.2% vs 48.0%; ods ratio, 4.6–11.9; P < .001).

Conclusion

Although the evidence for the management of acute sore throat is easily available, national guidelines are different with regard to the choice of evidence and the interpretation for clinical practice. Also a transparent and standardized guideline development method is lacking. These findings are important in the context of appropriate antibiotic use, the problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, and costs for the community.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### What's new with tubes, tonsils, and adenoids? [^113WMGYs]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations are constantly being updated for various pediatric surgical procedures, including the role for tympanostomy tubes, as well as indications for adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. With a growing body of research available on some of the most prevalent pediatric conditions, an update on the current concepts surrounding management is warranted.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113Ym1F8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History < 12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period < 12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥ 7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥ 2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1164M5yV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in children — evidence profile and policy level — is supported by "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B…; some Grade C observational studies", with "Level of confidence in evidence: Medium". Benefits note that "Patients who proceed with the option of tonsillectomy will achieve a modest reduction in the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infection for 1 year after surgery and a modest reduction in frequency of group A streptococcal infection for 1 year after surgery", while "Risks, harms, costs" include surgical morbidity and direct and indirect costs. The "Benefits-harm assessment" is a "Balance between benefit and harm", "Role of patient preferences" is "Large role for shared decision making", and the "Policy level: Option". The group held "near consensus" but "1 member… felt that tonsillectomy should not be recommended", with some preferring to list both tonsillectomy and watchful waiting as options.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113WzV16]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection: Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. Strong recommendation based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with limitations and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^115EYNaV]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Absolute benefits and harms

Although the evidence indicates that the treatment works on average, it did not reduce the severity of pain dramatically and failed to improve several other patient-important outcomes.

The infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview (GRADE summary of findings) of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids. Estimates of baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of the trials. The infographic also leads to point-of-care formats in the MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision making with patients.

Considering the evidence and its certainty, the panel was confident that:

Corticosteroids increase the chance of complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, reduce the severity of pain, and shorten the time to onset of pain relief (GRADE high to moderate quality evidence)
Corticosteroids are unlikely to reduce recurrence or relapse of symptoms or days missed from school or work (GRADE moderate quality evidence)
A single dose of corticosteroids is unlikely to cause serious adverse events The randomised trials did not report any major event attributable to single dose corticosteroids (GRADE moderate quality evidence) The panel also considered evidence from observational studies that used higher doses of steroids. A large retrospective US cohort study of private insurance claims assessed adverse events in 327 452 adults who received an outpatient prescription of corticosteroids. There was a small absolute increase in the rate of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture in the first 30 days (GRADE low quality evidence, due to suboptimal verification of diagnosis in large databases and confounding by indication). The panel agreed that such events seemed unlikely with single dose steroids Similarly, among paediatric populations, indirect evidence from a meta-analysis of 44 randomised trials did not report any major adverse events in patients with conditions requiring a short course of corticosteroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and pharyngitis or tonsillitis)
There are no differences in the relative effects of corticosteroids (when compared with usual care) between primary care settings and emergency departments
It is unlikely that new information will change interpretation for outcomes that are high to moderate quality of evidence.

The panel was less confident about whether:

Corticosteroids reduced antibiotic use, due to a lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms in patients not prescribed antibiotics immediately when consulting the physician (GRADE low quality evidence)
Corticosteroids reduced the average time to complete resolution of pain (GRADE low quality evidence).

### Indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy [^1178LwzC]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review recent clinical trials that provide a foundation on which clinicians can base decisions regarding adenotonsillar surgery for their patients.

Study Design

Review.

Methods

An evidence-based approach was used to review recent clinical trials addressing indications for adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy.

Results

Absolute indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy include adenotonsillar hyperplasia with obstructive sleep apnea, failure to thrive, or abnormal dentofacial growth; suspicion of malignant disease; and (for tonsillectomy) hemorrhagic tonsillitis. Relative indications for both procedures are adenotonsillar hyperplasia with upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, or speech impairment, and halitosis. Otitis media and recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis or adenoiditis are relative indications for adenoidectomy but not tonsillectomy. Recurrent or chronic pharyngotonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and streptococcal carriage are relative indications for tonsillectomy but not adenoidectomy.

Conclusion

Good clinical evidence regarding indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is available. Clinicians should make recommendations for surgery on the basis of this evidence.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^114xemQF]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval -9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy-pediatric clinics of north America [^1173trUs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are among the most commonly performed major pediatric operations in the United States, with more than 500,000 procedures performed annually. This procedure can be performed with or without adenoidectomy. These procedures were traditionally performed for recurrent tonsillitis; however, the vast majority of tonsillectomies are currently performed for obstructive symptoms. When performed for appropriate indications, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy can greatly improve a child's quality of life and general health. Given the prevalence of these conditions and subsequent surgical procedures, evidence-based recommendations are regularly evaluated and updated. As such, familiarity with these guidelines is necessary for pediatric practitioners. This review summarizes the indications, complications, and outcomes for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, as well as provides a brief overview of operative techniques.

### Does diagnostic uncertainty increase antibiotic prescribing in primary care? [^115boSLW]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of antibiotic prescriptions and study participants

The majority of the extracted prescriptions were issued for patients younger than 18 years (35.03%) or between the age of 40 and 64 years (32.96%). Slightly more than half (51.86%) of the patients were male. Approximately 62.68% of the prescriptions contained antibiotics (Fig. 1). Pneumonia was most likely (75.19%) to be prescribed antibiotics, followed by acute tonsillitis (66.60%) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (61.72%).

Fig. 1
Data collection and extraction procedure.

This figure shows the current study design. Physicians' characteristics regarding diagnostic uncertainty were collected by a questionnaire survey, and their antibiotic-prescribing behaviours in clinical practice were extracted from the outpatient prescription dataset. The surveyed characteristics of physicians were mapped with their prescriptions for three acute conditions commonly treated in primary care facilities, including upper respiratory tract infections, acute tonsillitis, and pneumonia with an unspecified organism. According to the guidelines, antibiotics are not recommended for URTIs, while cautious use of antibiotics can be applied for tonsillitis, and antibiotic prescriptions for pneumonia with an unspecified organism are recommended. These conditions have a varied likelihood of bacterial infection and are deemed sensitive to the physicians and patient tolerance of uncertainty.

The majority of the physician respondents were male (66.97%) and aged between 40 and 59 years (63.3%). Nearly two-thirds (64.22%) were general practitioners. Most respondents (74.62%) had over ten years of clinical experience. The vast majority (81.65%) reported attendance of antibiotic-prescribing training.

### Plain language summary for patients: tonsillectomy in children [^116PLjr7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This plain language summary for patients serves as an overview explaining tonsillectomy in children and to help patients, caregivers, and clinicians in their discussions about the reasons that a tonsillectomy may be needed, management options, and care related to the procedure. This summary applies to patients ages 1 through 18 years and is based on the 2019 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update)". This evidence-based guideline mainly addresses the need for tonsillectomy based on breathing problems that take place during sleep and repeated sore throats or "tonsillitis". The guideline was developed to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create clear recommendations for clinicians to use in medical practice.

The guideline is intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The guideline updates the 2002 Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline and discusses diagnosis and management, and recommendations are provided regarding antibiotic choices and dosing. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain the treatments of choice, and recommendations are made for the penicillin-allergic patient, which now include clindamycin.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115q8DWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillar structure, immune function, and effects of tonsillitis/tonsillectomy — The palatine tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs located at the junction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and the greatest immunologic activity of the tonsils is found between the ages of 3 and 10 years. While all 5 immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes are produced in the palatine tonsils, IgA is arguably the most important product of the tonsillar immune system. With recurrent tonsillitis, the controlled process of antigen transport and presentation is altered due to shedding of the M cells from the tonsil epithelium; nevertheless, there are no studies to date that demonstrate a significant clinical impact of tonsillectomy on the immune system.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NZKzB]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of "sore throat" (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

We searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy. Terms used included "upper respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "tonsillitis", "sore throat", and "corticosteroids" (including "dexamethasone", "betamethasone", "prednisone", and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1161NMiE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy — recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or > 2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥ 1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^115PycgS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

We assessed the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics on clinical outcomes, relapse, complications and adverse events in GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 4, 2010) and EMBASE (1974 to August 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

Seventeen trials (5352 participants) were included; 16 compared with penicillin (six with cephalosporins, six with macrolides, three with carbacephem and one with sulfonamides), one trial compared clindamycin and ampicillin. Randomisation reporting, allocation concealment and blinding were poor. There was no difference in symptom resolution between cephalosporins and penicillin (intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; N = 5; n = 2018; odds ratio for absence of resolution of symptoms (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12). Clinical relapse was lower with cephalosporins (N = 4; n = 1386; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99); overall number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50), but found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin. Carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment (N = 3; n = 795; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14), but only in children (N = 2; n = 233; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8.3). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides (N = 1, n = 489; OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient for clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be recommended as first choice.

### Azithromycin [^1156TZ8H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Indications and Usage (1.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults.

Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

### Defining the optimum treatment regimen for azithromycin in acute tonsillopharyngitis [^112euuzS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting children. Group A streptococci are the leading bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children and adults. Because inappropriate antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis is becoming a major issue, only true group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, proven by rapid antigen test or culture, should be treated with antibiotics. GABHS pharyngitis is often a mild and self-limiting infection in the absence of antimicrobial therapy. However, antimicrobial treatment must be administered to eradicate the pathogen from the throat, limit the spread of the infection and prevent possible progression to rheumatic fever, suppurative disease or toxin-mediated complications. Penicillin V for 10 days is the standard therapy and is effective in the management of GABHS pharyngitis. However, there are drawbacks to penicillin V therapy, including the length of the dosing regimen, which are leading to decreasing penicillin prescription rates in many countries. In addition bacteriologic treatment failures have been documented in up to 35% of GABHS patients treated with penicillin V, particularly in children < 6 years old. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for these failures, but poor compliance with the standard 10-day penicillin treatment is likely to be a major factor. There is growing evidence to suggest that children with GABHS pharyngitis can be effectively treated with non-penicillin V antibiotics, which have the advantage of simpler and shorter dosing regimens compared with penicillin V. Among the antibiotics that have been tested clinically, azithromycin is the most widely studied. A total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin, given either as 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days, provides the best rate of GABHS eradication. Thus a total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin given during 3 or 5 days constitutes an alternative treatment to standard penicillin therapy in cases of penicillin hypersensitivity, when patient nonadherence to a 10-day penicillin regimen is suspected or for patients who fail therapy with a beta-lactam.

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough? [^113aYefM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111kNSiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting policy attributes emphasize evidence quality, benefits and harms, exclusions, and policy level. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that fail to show clinically important advantages of surgery over observation alone; Grade C, observational studies showing improvement with watchful waiting. Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid unnecessary surgery with potential complications of vomiting, bleeding, pain, infection, or anesthesia problems. Risks, harms, costs: Waiting may result in delayed treatment in patients who have unusually frequent and severe recurrent throat infections; potential direct cost of managing future throat infections. Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: Panel consensus that tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection should be limited to circumstances for which clinically important benefits are shown in randomized controlled trials; emphasis on avoiding harm related to surgery or anesthesia in a condition that may be largely self-limited. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions include patients with > 1 peritonsillar abscess, personal or family history of rheumatic heart disease, Lemierre's syndrome, severe infections requiring hospitalization, or numerous repeat infections in a single household ("ping-pong spread"). Policy level: Strong recommendation. Differences of opinions: None.

### Antibiotics for treatment of sore throat in children and adults [^116NcnPh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care and to be prescribed antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics in primary medicine is a concern, hence it is important to establish their efficacy in treating sore throat and preventing secondary complications. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for reducing symptoms of sore throat for child and adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2021, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2021), Embase (January 1990 to April 2021), and two trial registries (searched 6 April 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications amongst children and adults seeking medical care for sore throat symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data, resolving any differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted the trial authors from three studies for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics on our primary outcomes (sore throat at day three and one week) and secondary outcomes (fever and headache symptoms and incidence of acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and quinsy).

Main Results

We included 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. The majority of included studies were conducted in the 1950s, during which time the rates of serious complications (especially acute rheumatic fever) were much higher than today. Although clinical antibiotic trials for sore throat and respiratory symptoms are still being conducted, it is unusual for them to include placebo or 'no treatment' control arms, which is a requirement for inclusion in the review. The age of participants ranged from younger than one year to older than 50 years, but most participants across all studies were adults. Although all studies recruited patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat, few of them distinguished between bacterial and viral aetiology. Bias may have been introduced through non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures and lack of blinding in some studies. Harms from antibiotics were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were thus not quantified for this review. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and headache at day three were reduced by using antibiotics, although 82% of participants in the placebo or no treatment group were symptom-free by one week. The reduction in sore throat symptoms at day three (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80; 16 studies, 3730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) was greater than at one week in absolute numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.75; 14 studies, 3083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) due to many cases in both treatment groups having resolved by this time. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 18. Compared with placebo or no treatment, antibiotics did not significantly reduce fever at day three (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; 8 studies, 1443 participants; high-certainty evidence), but did reduce headache at day three (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; 4 studies, 1020 participants; high-certainty evidence). 2. Suppurative complications Whilst the prevalence of suppurative complications was low, antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40; 10 studies, 3646 participants; high-certainty evidence) and quinsy within two months (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35; 8 studies, 2433 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those receiving placebo or no treatment, but not acute sinusitis within 14 days (Peto OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05; 8 studies, 2387 participants; high-certainty evidence). 3. Non-suppurative complications There were too few cases of acute glomerulonephritis to determine whether there was a protective effect of antibiotics compared with placebo against this complication (Peto OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 10 studies, 5147 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever within two months when compared to the control group (Peto OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; 18 studies, 12,249 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It should be noted that the overall prevalence of acute rheumatic fever was very low, particularly in the later studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat, and reduce the likelihood of headache, and some sore throat complications. As the effect on symptoms can be small, clinicians must judge on an individual basis whether it is clinically justifiable to use antibiotics to produce this effect, and whether the underlying cause of the sore throat is likely to be of bacterial origin. Furthermore, the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised. Few trials have attempted to measure symptom severity. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis. Additionally, more trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries, as well as in children.

Key action statements — strong recommendations — state that clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy; and clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115Lsdxr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trial limitations and evidence grading — when weighing tonsillectomy for recurrent infection, limitations of the evidence include small randomized samples and incomplete follow-up, prompting a downgrade in evidence level. Limitations of the available randomized controlled trials must also be considered when assessing the benefits and harms of surgery. Paradise and colleagues randomized 91 children to surgery versus observation after screening thousands, only a small percentage met strict entry criteria and only about half of eligible children agreed to randomization, and in both studies only about half (46%-62%) of enrolled children completed all 3 years of follow-up. Although these limitations did not invalidate the trials, the panel downgraded the aggregate evidence level from A (randomized trials) to B (randomized trials with limitations).

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111yNyzn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on results of this randomized clinical trial, CO 2 laser TO appears to be ideal for adult patients prioritizing quicker recovery and less postoperative discomfort. It suits those unable or unwilling to undergo general anesthesia, need minimal disruption to daily activities, or are apprehensive about the invasiveness of TE.

In addition, CO 2 laser TO is recommended for patients with mild to moderate recurrent tonsil-related symptoms, where full tonsil removal may not always be necessary. Although some residual tissue and symptoms may remain, TO significantly reduces symptom severity to clinically nonrelevant levels, with low postoperative risk and low health care cost. Its reduced need for in-hospital care and preservation of tonsillar structure might align better with health care goals of individual patients.

For patients who wish to avoid the possibility of a secondary procedure, traditional TE may be the more appropriate choice. Careful patient selection and counseling about the potential for residual symptoms and a secondary procedure are essential to optimizing outcomes and satisfaction. This personalized approach, backed by the major economic benefits demonstrated in this study, underscores the value of integrating CO 2 laser TO into treatment strategies for persistent tonsil-related afflictions in adults.

This study's long-term follow-up showed that CO 2 laser TO was less effective than TE in fully resolving tonsil issues but led to a substantial decrease in symptoms for all patients with residual symptoms, resulting in similar patient satisfaction. A slight advantage in 2-year QALYs was noted with TE, but CO 2 laser TO was less costly, with lower societal costs due to reduced work absence and productivity loss. Based on these findings, CO 2 laser TO appears to be a safe, effective, and cost-effective method for long-term relief of tonsil-related problems with excellent patient satisfaction.

### Empirical validation of guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children and adults [^111RUTM1]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recent guidelines for management of pharyngitis vary in their recommendations concerning empirical antibiotic treatment and the need for laboratory confirmation of group A streptococcus (GAS).

Objective

To assess the impact of guideline recommendations and alternative approaches on identification and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in children and adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Throat cultures and rapid antigen tests were performed on 787 children and adults aged 3 to 69 years with acute sore throat attending a family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta, from September 1999 to August 2002. Recommendations from 2 guidelines (those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine/American Academy of Family Physicians/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were compared with rapid testing alone, a clinical prediction rule (ie, the modified Centor score), and a criterion standard of treatment for positive throat culture results only.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity and specificity of each strategy for identifying GAS pharyngitis, total antibiotics recommended, and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

Results

In children, sensitivity for streptococcal infection ranged from 85.8% (133/155; 95% confidence interval, 79.3%-90.0%) for rapid testing to 100% for culturing all. In adults, sensitivity ranged from 76.7% (56/73; 95% CI, 65.4%-85.8%) for rapid testing without culture confirmation of negative results to 100% for culturing all. In children, specificity ranged from 90.3% (270/299; 95% CI, 86.4%-93.4%) for use of modified Centor score and throat culture to 100% for culturing all. In adults, specificity ranged from 43.8% (114/260; 95% CI, 37.7%-50.1%) for empirical treatment based on a modified Centor score of 3 or 4 to 100% for culturing all. Total antibiotic prescriptions were lowest with rapid testing (24.7% [194/787]; 95% CI, 21.7%-27.8%) and highest with empirical treatment of high-risk adults (45.7% [360/787]; 95% CI, 42.2%-49.3%), due to a high rate of unnecessary prescriptions in adults (43.8% [146/333]; 95% CI, 38.4%-49.4%).

Conclusions

Guideline recommendations for the selective use of throat cultures but antibiotic treatment based only on positive rapid test or throat culture results can reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for treatment of pharyngitis. However, empirical treatment of adults having a Centor score of 3 or 4 is associated with a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic use. In children, strategies incorporating throat culture or throat culture confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results are highly sensitive and specific. Throat culture of all adults or those selected on the basis of a clinical prediction rule had the highest sensitivity and specificity.

### Cefadroxil monohydrate (Cefadroxil) [^114jXXFm]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cefadroxil monohydrate is acid-stable and may be administered orally without regard to meals. Administration with food may be helpful in diminishing potential gastrointestinal complaints occasionally associated with oral cephalosporin therapy.

Adults

Urinary Tract Infections: For uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (i.e., cystitis) the usual dosage is 1 or 2 g per day in a single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.).

For all other urinary tract infections the usual dosage is 2 g per day in divided doses (b.i.d.).

Skin and Skin Structure Infections: For skin and skin structure infections the usual dosage is 1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.).

Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis: Treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis — 1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.) for 10 days.

Children

For urinary tract infections, the recommended daily dosage for children is 30 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours. For pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and impetigo, the recommended daily dosage for children is 30 mg/kg/day in a single dose or in equally divided doses every 12 hours. For other skin and skin structure infections, the recommended daily dosage is 30 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours. In the treatment of beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of cefadroxil monohydrate should be administered for at least 10 days.

Renal Impairment:

In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of cefadroxil monohydrate should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent drug accumulation. The following schedule is suggested. In adults, the initial dose is 1000 mg of cefadroxil monohydrate and the maintenance dose (based on the creatinine clearance rate [mL/min/1.73 M2]) is 500 mg at the time intervals listed below.

Patients with creatinine clearance rates over 50 mL/min may be treated as if they were patients having normal renal function.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^116kw671]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute sore throat is defined as pain in the throat for less than 14 days. Acute sore throat could be caused by pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, or retropharyngeal abscess. Some patients with sore throat also experience headache, fever, muscle stiffness, cough, and general malaise.

Acute sore throat is common, but only a minority of patients will visit their general practitioner. A survey reported that the main reasons are to establish the cause of the symptoms, obtain pain relief, and to gain information on the course of the disease. Data from Dutch and Flemish primary care databases show that, for every 1000 consecutive patients consulting a general practitioner, 50 present with an acute sore throat. In the US, more than 92 million visits by adults to primary care practices and emergency departments between 1997 and 2010 were recorded. Sore throat presenting as acute tonsillitis is also the commonest cause for emergency admission to otorhinolaryngology services in the US.

Acute sore throat is a self limiting disease and typically resolves after 7–10 days in adults and 2–7 days in children. Most infections are of viral origin; only a few are caused by a bacterial infection, of which group A β-haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common pathogens. Evidence suggests that the time to resolution is not associated with the type of pathogen. About 2% of patients initially presenting with sore throat will have a mononucleosis infection caused by an Epstein-Barr virus, which could prolong the duration of symptoms.

Some patients experience unacceptable morbidity and inconvenience, and miss school or work due to recurrent sore throat. Pain is a common reason for work or school absence. Complications of sore throat are rare: about 0.2% of patients with tonsillitis will develop a peritonsillar abscess.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115ccByT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — recurrent throat infection management: Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to: multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^111rcuwg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

14. CLINICAL STUDIES

In a randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy study in adults and pediatrics (age ≥ 12 years) with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to S. pyogenes, MOXATAG 775 mg QD for 10 days was non-inferior to penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.

Using strict evaluability and microbiologic response criteria 4–8 days post-therapy, the following bacteriological eradication rates and statistical outcomes in the per-protocol (PPb) and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations were obtained (Table 4). The mITT population included all randomized patients with a positive throat culture for S. pyogenes at baseline. The PPb population included mITT patients who had post-therapy cultures, were compliant with treatment, and didn't have major protocol violations.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114jcg9B]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

The laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy study (TOMTOM study) is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (meaning that broad inclusion criteria comparable to a real-world situation were applied) comparing functional recovery time, resolution or reduction of tonsil concerns, and surgical complications between tonsillotomy and tonsillectomy in adults. Patients were recruited from 5 otolaryngology departments of teaching hospitals in the Netherlands from January 2018 to December 2019. This report followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The study protocol and the statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of The Hague in the Netherlands. This study adhered to Dutch health care laws and the principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. No one received compensation or was offered any incentive for participating in this study.

Patients

Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with tonsil-related concerns that did not resolve sufficiently with conservative management, including antibiotic treatment, were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients with the following conditions, similar to real-life standard of care practice, were included: chronic or recurrent tonsillitis (indication for surgery was determined following the Dutch guideline of > 4 tonsillitis episodes per year not responding sufficiently to antibiotic treatment), tonsil-related halitosis, tonsillolithiasis, dysphagia, and sleep apnea caused by the tonsils. Exclusion criteria were inability to complete all trial procedures and follow-up visits, inability to keep the mouth open for at least 5 seconds continuously, inability to relax the jaw for 30 minutes, a sensitive gag reflex on physical examination, Friedman classification grade 4 tonsil size, insufficient exposure of the entire tonsil on physical examination, history of peritonsillar abscess, coagulation disorders (including the use of anticoagulants), contraindications for local or general anesthesia, evident tonsil asymmetry or other signs of possible malignant or premalignant neoplasm of the oropharynx, immunodeficiency, and pregnancy.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^113kQ7Qw]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Evaluation of culture and antibiotic use in patients with pharyngitis [^1112heRM]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate practice patterns for treatment of patients with pharyngitis with regard to testing for group A beta hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, frequency of antibiotic use, and appropriate choice of antibiotics.

Study Design

The authors conducted a retrospective review of billing data for 10,482 office visits for pharyngitis.

Methods

The 2004 billing database for a tertiary institution was queried for outpatient visits for pharyngitis or tonsillitis, group A Streptococcus tests (GAST), and antibiotic prescriptions filled after the visit. Patients were separated by age group and analyzed for the proportion of patients that received a GAST and proportion prescribed an antibiotic. Antibiotic prescriptions were also analyzed to determine whether they were appropriate for treatment of GABHS.

Results

A total of 68.7% of all patients and 82.2% of pediatric patients were tested for GAST. A total of 47.1% of adult patients and 44.9% of pediatric patients received an antibiotic. For adult patients for whom GAST was obtained, 48.6% were prescribed an antibiotic versus 53.6% of those not tested. Streptococcus testing was a significant predictor of antibiotic use (P < .0001), whereas age was not (P = 0.22). A total of 82.1% of all antibiotics prescribed were recommended for treatment of GABHS.

Conclusions

Most patients seen for pharyngitis were tested for GABHS, but pediatric patients were tested more frequently than adults. Patients who received a GAST were less likely to receive antibiotics. The rates experienced in our tertiary academic institution are higher than previously quoted for community practice. When antibiotics were prescribed, they were usually appropriate for the treatment of GABHS based on current recommendations.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114Nqu6T]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia offer comparable symptom relief but shorter functional recovery times than conventional tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia among adults undergoing surgical tonsil removal?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 199 adults found that compared with tonsillectomy, functional recovery was quicker after laser tonsillotomy although resolution of the chief concern leading to surgery was lower.

Meaning

Depending on individual patient preferences, laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia may be a feasible alternative to conventional tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia among adults.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111VrcL7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

(1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1137jSUT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy — perioperative antibiotic therapy: Policy level is Strong recommendation against routine perioperative antibiotics, with exclusions for patients with cardiac conditions requiring perioperative antibiotics for prophylaxis and patients undergoing tonsillectomy with concurrent peritonsillar abscess. Historically, up to 79% of polled otolaryngologists in the United States once used antibiotics, but a Cochrane review of 10 randomized controlled trials suggests that antibiotics do not reduce pain, the need for pain medication, or bleeding. In pooled analyses, antibiotics had no impact on secondary bleeding of any severity (7 trials) or on significant secondary bleeding requiring readmission, blood transfusion, or return to the operating room (3 trials); one pooled analysis (2 trials) showed reduced fever > 99.9°F, but two other trials showed no benefit. Across trials, antibiotics had no impact on pain in 5 of 7 trials, analgesic use in 5 of 6, time to normal activity in 4 of 6, or time to normal diet in 4 of 7; when benefits occurred they were generally small with 1- to 2-day differences in return to normal diet. In an outpatient setting, perioperative refers to the 24 hours prior to and following the surgical procedure. Listed benefits of withholding antibiotics include avoidance of adverse events related to antimicrobial therapy, including rash, allergy, gastrointestinal upset, and induced bacterial resistance, with a Benefits-harm assessment of Preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^111JxXht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy [^1124AmHf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common pediatric surgical procedures performed in the United States; more than 530,000 are performed annually in children younger than 15 years of age. AT was traditionally performed for recurrent tonsillitis and its sequelae but in recent times, sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea in children has emerged as the primary indication for surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils. The new guidelines used by clinicians to identify children who are appropriate candidates for AT address indications based primarily on obstructive and infectious causes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111yKUAS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting implementation stresses monitoring and documentation to assess impact. The purpose of this statement is to avoid unnecessary intervention in children with recurrent throat infection who have a favorable natural history and are likely to improve without tonsillectomy. Watchful waiting does not imply inaction. Rather, patients should be closely monitored by regular clinic visits and episodes of pharyngotonsillitis accurately documented. Throat infections are treated most often by the primary care provider, but other clinicians may be involved (eg, health care providers at emergency departments or urgent care centers). The primary care provider should collate documentation of all such visits. The clinical characteristics of each episode should be recorded, including the symptoms, physical findings, rapid antigen detection testing, and/or culture results if performed, as well as days of school absence and any quality of life (QoL) issues. Only with this information can the clinician assess the significance of the impact of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis for the patient and caregiver.

### Evaluating the need, timing and best choice of antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis infections in children [^112ZgTUz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Deciding whether an antibiotic is necessary, when to begin therapy and selecting an optimal drug is an everyday challenge in clinical practice. In vitro susceptibility testing which determines the minimum concentration necessary for a particular antibiotic to inhibit or kill most strains of a bacterial species and pharmacodynamic modeling are useful but have limitations. The need for antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) has been recently questioned. However, explanations for uniformly positive results with many antibiotic and placebo comparative trials include overdiagnosis of AOM at study entry, inclusion of patients with mild or uncomplicated AOM and broad criteria for the definition of clinical success. Recurrent and persistent AOM does not have as favorable a natural history as uncomplicated AOM; children below 2 years of age benefit most from antibiotic therapy. Selecting the best choice among the many antibiotics that can be used to treat AOM has become more complex over the last decade due to escalating antibiotic resistance among the pathogens that cause this infection. Broader spectrum antibiotics such as cefdinir, the newly introduced third generation cephalosporin, have their most prominent use in the treatment of persistent and recurrent AOM. In the early 1950s and 1960s penicillin clearly was the best available agent for the treatment of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. In the 1970s the situation began to change as cephalosporin antibiotics became available. Superior eradication rates with cephalosporins such as cefdinir have now been well-documented. The leading hypothesis to explain the widening gap in efficacy between penicillin and cephalosporins relates to two major concepts: the presence of copathogens and differential alteration of the normal microbial ecology in the throat as a consequence of the selected therapy. There are positive and negative consequences to early initiation of antibiotic therapy for GAS tonsillopharyngitis. Penicillin has persisting good efficacy in patients older than the age of 12 years and in those who have been ill for > 2 days. Shortening therapy for GAS tonsillopharyngitis offers a therapeutic advantage. Cefpodoxime proxetil and cefdinir have a 5-day indication for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis. Antibiotics with lower side effect profile, infrequent dosing, good palatability in suspension formulation and efficacy with short duration of treatment may lead to better outcomes because noncompliance often results in failed therapy, persistence of infection and morbidity.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^116WzsnV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent sore throat outcomes and Paradise criteria: While tonsillectomy can reduce the recurrence rate of sore throat, missed school days, and health care utilization, this effect does not extend beyond the first year postoperatively, and benefits are significantly lessened for children with a mild disease burden; as a result, tonsillectomy is not cost-effective and does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in children who do not meet the "Paradise criteria" (7 episodes in the past year, 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years).

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113XdxGT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsillolithiasis, halitosis, dysphagia, and snoring are common tonsil-related conditions in adults. When conservative treatment of these conditions fails, surgery may be indicated.

Classic dissection tonsillectomy with complete tonsil removal under general anesthesia is the most used surgical technique. In the United States and Europe combined, more than 500 000 tonsillectomies are performed in adult patients every year. After tonsillectomy, recovery to normal function is typically long. Postoperative complications of tonsillectomy include bleeding, infection, and severe pain, any of which may lead to hospital readmissions and contribute to a protracted recovery. Partial removal of the tonsil, tonsillotomy, has been performed for 3000 years and is increasingly being reexplored to potentially decrease patient burden and risk. During tonsillotomy, only the cryptic lymphatic tissue is removed, and the tonsil capsule that contains larger nerves and blood vessels is left intact. This may lead to less postoperative pain and bleeding. Tonsillotomy may be performed in adults using different instruments and techniques, including the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser, diathermy, radiofrequency, microdebrider, coblation, bipolar electrosurgical device, and cold steel dissection.

The CO 2 laser is the most used laser modality in tonsillotomy and is known for its good ablation and hemorrhage-controlling characteristics. An advantage of the CO 2 laser is its ability to perform tonsillotomy under local anesthesia without sedation. General anesthesia has additional effects on postoperative and functional recovery, and obviating the need for general anesthesia may provide additional recovery benefit over tonsillectomy. However, there is a lack of evidence with sufficient quality regarding the clinical usefulness of tonsillotomy compared with tonsillectomy in adults.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare CO 2 laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia to tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia for tonsil-related concerns in adults. We hypothesized that tonsillotomy would have a shorter functional recovery period. Secondary outcomes included relief 6 months after surgery of the primary concern that led to tonsil removal and tonsil symptom severity.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^111t8WHa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.

### Pathogen shifts and changing cure rates for otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis [^113fCrs2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use has caused a decrease in the incidence of recurrent and refractory acute otitis media in the United States and a shift in the predominant pathogens. Now Haemophilus influenzae is the most commonly isolated organism (about 60% of the total), and more than half the strains make beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to amoxicillin. Penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci, the main target of antibiotic therapy in the 1990s, has become a much less common isolate (10%- 25% of the total). These changes impact antibiotic selection for acute otitis media. Penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis does not meet the minimum United States Food and Drug Administration standards for first-line treatment, which is 85% or greater eradication at the end of therapy. Recent results with amoxicillin suggest its efficacy is also waning. Cephalosporins have the highest bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. This has implications for optimal antibiotic therapy.

### A randomized clinical trial of peritonsillar abscess treatment comparing drainage and tonsillectomy [^114yNy6f]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of drainage under local anesthesia compared to immediate tonsillectomy to treat uncomplicated unilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) in adults.

Methods

A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary care university hospital. Adults with PTA radiologically confirmed as ≥ 1 cm and uncomplicated were randomly assigned to two groups using block randomization. They immediately underwent either tonsillectomy under general anesthesia or drainage under local anesthesia. The primary outcome was treatment success at 48 h, defined as a reduction in swelling and restoration of swallowing function, allowing hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included pain and anxiety levels, along with postoperative bleeding.

Results

A total of 41 patients were included (66% male; age range 18–77 years). Twenty-one patients underwent tonsillectomy, while 20 underwent drainage. The success rate was higher in the tonsillectomy group (100%) than in the drainage group (75%, p = 0.02). Pain and anxiety levels were significantly higher in the drainage group (p < 0.01). Postoperative bleeding occurred in 33% of the tonsillectomy group, while no bleeding was reported in the drainage group (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Immediate tonsillectomy for treating PTA offers definitive management with high efficacy, albeit with an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Drainage under local anesthesia is associated with a higher failure rate and increased patient discomfort but demonstrates a better safety profile. Treatment decisions should be tailored based on patient preferences, clinical presentation, and available resources.

### Acute pharyngitis [^117St1Y4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

The primary care physician needs to identify those patients with acute pharyngitis who require specific antimicrobial therapy and to avoid unnecessary and potentially deleterious treatment in the large majority of patients who have a benign, self-limited infection that is usually viral. In most cases, differentiating between these two types of infection can be accomplished easily if the physician considers the epidemiologic setting, the history, and the physical findings, plus the results of a few readily available laboratory tests. When antimicrobial therapy is required, the safest, narrowest-spectrum, and most cost-effective drugs should be used. Despite agreement on these principles by expert advisory committees, data from national surveys of ambulatory care indicate that antimicrobial agents continue to be prescribed indiscriminately for upper respiratory infections.

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children in the United States. Indications and recommendations for perioperative management are multiple and may vary among clinicians. Although tonsillectomy is a safe procedure, it can be associated with morbidity. Several techniques have been developed to reduce perioperative complications, but evidence of this reduction is lacking. This article provides clinicians with evidence-based guidance on perioperative clinical decision making and surgical technique for tonsillectomy.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^111ZDoJd]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Patients with acute tonsillitis are a good example of surgical department admissions requiring conservative management within otolaryngology. Acute tonsillitis is inflammation of the palatine tonsils in the lateral oropharynx. A common disease, is it predominantly caused by viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms typically include sore throat and tonsillar exudates but in more severe cases can present with odynophagia, dysphagia, fever and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients require admission when they are no longer able to maintain oral intake including medications. Once admitted, patients are typically treated with a combination of intravenous antibiotics and analgesia and sometimes intravenous dexamethasone is added to reduce inflammation. Across the UK, mean length of stay for each patient with acute tonsillitis is 19.2 hours. In 2019–2020, there were over 73 000 NHS hospital admissions in England for acute tonsillitis representing over 58 000 bed days. A safe reduction in length of stay for patients with tonsillitis, particularly if discharged in the morning, would provide increased hospital capacity for surgical beds could assist with increased elective operating capacity as part of COVID-19 recovery plan.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis [^114WGiQz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly. The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy. Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers. Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood. At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114Vrioh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — definition, scope, and epidemiology — is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil by dissecting the peritonsillar space; the guideline targets children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy and is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates; tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age.
