## Question

A 16-year-old with known cystic fibrosis presents with chronic productive cough, recurrent Pseudomonas airway infections, and bronchiectasis on CT. For billing the primary diagnosis reflecting pulmonary involvement, which ICD-10 code should be assigned?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be assigned as the primary diagnosis for a 16-year-old with known cystic fibrosis who presents with chronic productive cough, recurrent Pseudomonas airway infections, and bronchiectasis on CT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most specific ICD-10 code that captures cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations. Then, I should verify whether bronchiectasis in this context is already encompassed by the CF code or whether a separate bronchiectasis code is warranted. Next, I will consider coding hierarchy and sequencing rules to ensure the primary diagnosis is correctly prioritized. Finally, I will double-check for any exceptions or nuances that might change the coding choice in this scenario.

> Let me first confirm the most specific CF code. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation consensus specifies that cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations should be coded as E84.0, which explicitly denotes CF with pulmonary involvement and would capture chronic cough, recurrent Pseudomonas infections, and bronchiectasis as part of the CF lung disease phenotype [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether bronchiectasis requires a separate code here. Bronchiectasis is a structural manifestation of CF lung disease and is included within the pulmonary manifestations encompassed by E84.0; using an additional bronchiectasis code (J47.x) would be redundant and incorrect in a patient with established CF, as J47.x is intended for non-CF bronchiectasis, not CF-related bronchiectasis [^ea6cd846] [^009c5985].

> Hold on, I should verify the coding hierarchy. In ICD-10, we prioritize the most specific etiologic diagnosis that explains the clinical picture. Here, the etiology is cystic fibrosis with pulmonary involvement, so E84.0 should be listed as the primary diagnosis, with any additional codes (for example, chronic Pseudomonas infection) sequenced secondarily as appropriate to capture comorbidities or complications without duplicating the underlying disease process [^ea6cd846].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any exception where J47.x might still apply. Non-CF bronchiectasis codes (J47.0, J47.1, J47.9) are used when bronchiectasis is not due to CF; in a patient with confirmed CF, those codes are inappropriate for the bronchiectasis attributable to CF, reinforcing that E84.0 is the correct primary diagnosis for this encounter [^ea6cd846] [^009c5985].

> Final answer: The primary ICD-10 diagnosis code for this 16-year-old with known cystic fibrosis presenting with chronic productive cough, recurrent Pseudomonas airway infections, and bronchiectasis on CT is E84.0 (Cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations) [^ea6cd846].

---

The primary ICD-10 diagnosis for a 16-year-old with cystic fibrosis, chronic productive cough, recurrent Pseudomonas infections, and bronchiectasis is **E84.0** (Cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations). This code captures the underlying CF with its pulmonary complications, including bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas infection. Use **J47.9** (Bronchiectasis, unspecified) only as a secondary code if additional detail is needed for billing or research, but E84.0 should be primary because it already encompasses the pulmonary manifestations of CF [^ea6cd846].

## ICD-10 coding for cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations

ICD-10 provides specific codes for cystic fibrosis, including pulmonary manifestations. The **primary code** for this patient is E84.0 — Cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations. This code encompasses the chronic productive cough, recurrent Pseudomonas infections, and bronchiectasis seen in CF lung disease [^ea6cd846].

---

## Rationale for selecting E84.0 as the primary diagnosis

- **Specificity**: E84.0 specifically denotes CF with pulmonary involvement, aligning with the patient's clinical picture.
- **Comprehensiveness**: This single code captures the underlying disease and its pulmonary complications, including bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas infection.
- **Billing accuracy**: Using E84.0 as primary ensures accurate billing and reflects the true clinical scenario.

---

## Secondary diagnosis coding considerations

While E84.0 suffices as the primary diagnosis, some clinicians add a secondary code for bronchiectasis (J47.9) to provide additional detail. However, this is **optional** because bronchiectasis is already implied by E84.0. If used, J47.9 should be listed secondarily and not replace E84.0 as the primary diagnosis.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough documentation. Ensure the record clearly states:

- Confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
- Chronic productive cough.
- Recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
- Bronchiectasis on CT.
- Any other relevant clinical findings or complications.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The primary ICD-10 diagnosis for this patient is **E84.0** (Cystic fibrosis with pulmonary manifestations). This code accurately reflects the underlying disease and its pulmonary complications. Use J47.9 only secondarily if additional detail is needed, but E84.0 should remain primary.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: its diagnosis and management [^c936e237]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

An increase in the frequency of diagnosing non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children is due to heightened awareness of the disease and the wider availability of high-resolution computed tomography. The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent "wet/productive" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life. In this article, we review its pathogenesis and diagnosis and the evidence base for available treatments.

Methods

Population

The Electronic Health Records (EHR) at our tertiary care hospital were searched with the diagnosis code bronchiectasis (ICD-10-CM: J47) between April 2014 and December 2021. We included the patients who had the diagnosis confirmed on the basis of a high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) chest and at least 3 visits to the Pulmonary clinic. Patients under the age of 18, or with known cystic fibrosis (CF) or diagnosed with CF during the investigation were excluded from final analysis (Fig. 2). We identified a total of 260 patients that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Local Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained and the research methods were carried out in accordance with declaration of Helsinki.

Study variables

Basic demographic data was collected for all study participants along with clinical data including spirometric values, etiological investigations for primary or secondary immunodeficiencies and for hereditary conditions such as CF and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Sweat chloride was used to diagnose CF, and in patients with positive or indeterminate sweat test or those with high clinical suspicion for it, CF mutation testing was done initially using a 97-mutation panel and, if negative, then through gene sequencing. Nasal nitric oxide and PICADAR score were used to screen patients for PCD. In addition, screen-positive patients had respiratory mucosal brushings sent for transmission electron microscopy. Patients with typical Kartagener's syndrome and those who already had siblings with an established diagnosis of PCD did not have any of the above investigations. The sputum culture results and the scores of the bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) were also recorded. If all investigations were non-diagnostic, aetiology was labelled "post-infectious" based on the past medical history of pulmonary TB, pertussis, measles or severe pneumonia in childhood. Without the past history of infections, aetiology was labelled "idiopathic".

Statistical analysis

Quantitative variables are expressed as the means and standard deviation if normally distributed or median and interquartile range (IQR) if otherwise. Categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages. Relationship between various study variables was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical comparisons between continuous characteristics were carried out using the two tailed t-test, and a significant p-value was taken to be less than 0.05. Data analysis was done with MS Excel 2019.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults: a review [^ae86e554]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bronchiectasis:

- **Definition**: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition, which presents with permanent and abnormal dilation of the bronchi, and is characterized by mild to moderate airway obstruction and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of bronchiectasis include sequelae of previous bacterial infection or mycobacterial infection (e.g., following pneumonia, whooping cough, or tuberculosis), as well as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, toxic lung injury, primary ciliary dyskinesia, COPD, and α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Impairment of airway defense mechanisms due to inflammation and persistent infection results in bronchiectasis.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include productive cough, excessive sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, and recurrent chest infections. The disease can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients with acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is 9% and 30%, respectively.

Chronic productive purulent cough — pathology and investigations including pointer-driven evaluation: Chronic productive purulent cough is always pathological, reflective of conditions such as bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis116 and aspiration, and the workup usually involves detailed evaluation that includes the spectrum of available investigations to outline structure and function of the respiratory system as well as evaluation for immunological causes and to exclude cystic fibrosis and other underlying systemic abnormalities; these investigations may include chest CT scans, flexible bronchoscopy, barium swallow, video fluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing, echocardiography, complex sleep polysomnography, and nuclear medicine scans, and when bronchiectasis is suspected, children should be evaluated using an appropriate pathway; additionally, for children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and with specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), we recommend that further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy and/or chest CT, assessment for aspiration and/or evaluation of immunologic competency) be undertaken to assess for an underlying disease (Grade 1B).

### Severe bronchiectasis [^27a4b863]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is primarily the result of airway injury and remodeling attributable to recurrent or chronic inflammation and infection. The underlying etiologies include autoimmune diseases, severe infections, genetic abnormalities, and acquired disorders. Recurrent airway inflammation and infection may also be the result of allergic or immunodeficiency states such as allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses or HIV/AIDS. Bronchiectasis should be included in the differentiation diagnosis of any patient with chronic respiratory complaints such as cough and sputum production. Early clinical manifestations may be subtle. Hallmarks of severe bronchiectasis include fetid breath, chronic cough, and sputum production. The associated chronic respiratory infections and airway sepsis are punctuated by episodes of acute exacerbation. Prompt recognition and treatment of bronchiectasis may allow for prevention of disease progression and irreversible loss of lung function. This review of severe non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis describes the current pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and management of bronchiectasis. We review how impaired airway clearance and the inability to resolve infection and inflammation creates a vicious cycle of recurrent injury. The common clinical features of bronchiectasis and findings are presented and illustrated by radiographic images. The common species and significance of various organisms often recovered from the distal airways including: tuberculous and environmental mycobacteria, aspergillus, and bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be covered. Management strategies including sputum surveillance, sputum clearance, antimicrobial therapy including antifungal and antimyobacterial agents as well as the evidence for the use of inhalational and anti-inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids are also discussed. Recommendations for the work-up and therapy of complications including hemoptysis and respiratory failure are presented.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^d31ad918]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation — when to suspect bronchiectasis

A 66-year-old lady presents with a chest infection associated with cough productive of green sputum and increasing shortness of breath. She had never smoked and has no relevant past medical history. Chest x-ray shows no abnormality. She is treated with antibiotic therapy by her primary care physician and improves. She attends again a few months later with worsening productive cough. Her primary care physician notes that she has had several courses of antibiotics for chest infections over the previous 3 winters and has reported a chronic productive cough on a daily basis for the past 3 years.

In new patients or those that do not have an established diagnosis, one of the most common core symptoms is a persistent cough (> 90% of patients), often producing large quantities of mucoid (white or clear) or purulent (dark yellow, green or brown) sputum(Table 2). Adults may have a history of symptoms over many years. Recurrent respiratory tract infections also raise the possibility of bronchiectasis, and patients may take a long time to recover from chest infections or require multiple courses of antibiotics before symptoms fully resolve. Dyspnoea is present in a high proportion of cases, with frequent haemoptysis in severe disease. These symptoms can be variable across patients, with some having symptoms daily and others only having symptoms during exacerbations. The longstanding textbook teaching of bronchiectasis patients with widespread crackles, digital clubbing and cachexia is now rarely seen.

### Criteria and definitions for the radiological and clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults for use in clinical trials: international consensus recommendations [^c68fe483]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to both a clinical disease and a radiological appearance that has multiple causes and can be associated with a range of conditions. Disease heterogeneity and the absence of standardised definitions have hampered clinical trials of treatments for bronchiectasis and are important challenges in clinical practice. In view of the need for new therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis to reduce the disease burden, we established an international taskforce of experts to develop recommendations and definitions for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults to facilitate the standardisation of terminology for clinical trials. Systematic reviews were used to inform discussions, and Delphi processes were used to achieve expert consensus. We prioritised criteria for the radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis and suggest recommendations on the use and central reading of chest CT scans to confirm the presence of bronchiectasis for clinical trials. Furthermore, we developed a set of consensus statements concerning the definitions of clinical bronchiectasis and its specific signs and symptoms, as well as definitions for chronic bacterial infection and sustained culture conversion. The diagnosis of clinically significant bronchiectasis requires both clinical and radiological criteria, and these expert recommendations and proposals should help to optimise patient recruitment into clinical trials and allow reliable comparisons of treatment effects among different interventions for bronchiectasis. Our consensus proposals should also provide a framework for future research to further refine definitions and establish definitive guidance on the diagnosis of bronchiectasis.

### Atypical presentation of cystic fibrosis at 70 years of age [^ca839613]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive condition, mostly diagnosed in infancy. It is uncommon for adults to be diagnosed with CF, especially after the age of 65. Individuals, who are diagnosed later in life, usually have milder disease and single organ involvement which can be challenging for clinicians to diagnose. Adult CF patients are more likely to be pancreatic sufficient. They have predominantly upper lobe bronchiectasis, lower incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with Staphylococcus aureus and are more likely to have mutations other than ΔF508.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^be24b9b6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a condition in which an area of the bronchial lumen is permanently and abnormally widened, with accompanying infection. Bronchiectasis is found in a variety of pulmonary diseases, both genetically caused and acquired, such as severe pulmonary infections and cystic fibrosis (CF), but is also a feature of Kartagener syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, or primary immunodeficiencies. Bronchietasis is caused by long-term excessive inflammatory damage to the airways, which results in tissue breakdown, enlargement of the affected airways and the key clinical symptoms of chronic productive cough and shortness of breath. Globally, in up to half of all cases the cause cannot be identified (idiopathic). Those cases together with several other known aetiologies such as post-infectious and allergic hypersensitivity collectively fall under the category 'non-cystic fibrosis' (non-CF) bronchiectasis. Here we discuss the key features of both CF and non-CF related bronchiectasis with respect to their pathogenesis, imaging and clinical management.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^33d6f659]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is a condition where patients have symptoms of persistent or recurrent bronchial sepsis related to irreversibly damaged and dilated bronchi. The incidence and prevalence of bronchiectasis is rising. Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the United Kingdom, patients 18 and over with a Read code of Bronchiectasis were identified, and the point prevalence in February each year from 2004 to 2013 was measured. This showed that the point prevalence of coded bronchiectasis rose from 351 to 566 per 100,000 in women and from 301 to 486 per 100,000 in males between 2004 and 2013. A retrospective study using healthcare data from the United States showed a rise in prevalence of 8% between 2001 and 2012, but with a point prevalence of 139/100,000. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guideline for non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis was published in 2010and included children. The BTS commissioned an update to the guidelines in 2013 to take into account any new evidence. The new BTS Guideline covers bronchiectasis in adults and provides recommendations and good practice points based on an updated evidence review.

Systematic electronic database searches of relevant literature were carried out in June 2014 and June 2016, identifying relevant papers published since the previous guideline. In total, 1799 such papers were identified and reviewed by pairs of Guideline Committee members. Appraisal of the evidence was carried out based on Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology, as set out in the BTS Guideline Production Manual. The reliability of the evidence in each individual study was graded, using the SIGN critical appraisal checklists and levels of evidence assigned to evidence statements, according to the levels of evidence in Table 1. Recommendations made by the Guideline Committee were formulated based on the evidence statements and graded according to the SIGN grading system (Table 2).

The composition of the Guideline Committee and the subsequent guideline recommendations were biased towards secondary care. One member of the Guideline Committee (KGJ — lead author of this paper) was from primary care. This paper acknowledges this and with five primary care authors aims to look at the relevance of the guidelines for primary care.

### Respiratory infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children with cystic fibrosis… [^7205cffd]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context Patients with cystic fibrosis are susceptible to lower respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and typically acquire this organism in early childhood. Once P aeruginosa infection is established, eradication may be impossible, and progressive lung disease often aggravates morbidity and mortality risks. The ability to diagnose CF by genetic testing at birth makes it possible to. determine the temporal sequence of events that result in P aeruginosa–associated pulmonary infections. Objective To evaluate the longitudinal relationship between the production of an antibody response against P aeruginosa and clinical factors associated with P aeruginosa pulmonary infections in patients with CF diagnosed in early life. Design, Setting, and Patients Serum samples and oropharyngeal cultures were obtained.

and integration of CF infants with older, chronically infected patients were associated with a significantly increased risk of P aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Conclusions In CF patients diagnosed through neonatal screening, P aeruginosa pulmonary infections occurred 6 to 12 months before the organism was isolated from respiratory secretions. The longitudinal monitoring. of P aeruginosa antibody titers, in concert with WCXR score, should facilitate diagnosis and treatment of P aeruginosa pulmonary infections in young children with CF. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by malnutrition due to pancreatic insufficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary. disease with recurrent respiratory tract infections. 1 In most patients, the characteristic lung disease eventually becomes the predominant problem.

Studies of the epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF have demonstrated the prevalence of2, 3 and morbidity caused by3, 4 this respiratory pathogen and have provided some insights regarding the timing5 and risk factors6-10. With the ability to diagnose CF by genetic testing at birth, it is now possible to determine the temporal sequence of events that result in P aeruginosa–associated pulmonary infections. More precise and reliable knowledge of these events could be valuable for the development of optimal therapeutic regimens for the treatment of these infections, which. of P aeruginosa–associated pulmonary infection, the detection of P aeruginosa by oropharyngeal cultures, and the production of an antibody response in 68 patients who were diagnosed with CF through newborn screening.

The antigens used were a cell lysate derived from P aeruginosa. of the patient's physician. Data on the presence and magnitude of cough, other signs of respiratory infection, and the use of antibiotics were obtained at all protocol visits; oral antibiotics given routinely included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporins. Cough severity was assessed by parents and reported to. investigators at visits according to 4 categories: 0, no cough; 1, rare cough; 2, cough in the morning or with postural drainage; or 3, frequent, productive, or paroxysmal cough.

### Cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: update 2008–11 [^bf35401d]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

A review is presented of key clinical papers published in Thorax and elsewhere between 2008 and April 2011 which have advanced our understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia and non-CF bronchiectasis. Studies were identified through searches of the Thorax archive and the Medline database. Within the field of CF, the following key themes were studied: diagnosis in equivocal CF, assessment of CF lung disease, novel therapies addressing the basic defect in CF, maintenance pulmonary therapies, management of early Pseudomonas infection, the microbiology of CF lung disease, renal impairment in CF and controversies in lung transplantation in CF.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^405265a8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for cystic fibrosis, more specifically with respect to prophylactic azithromycin, CFF 2013 guidelines recommend to implement chronic azithromycin therapy to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations for patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways.

### Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection definition: euroCareCF working group report [^da465c44]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa develops in most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF); by adulthood 80% of patients are infected and chronic P. aeruginosa infection is the primary cause of increased morbidity and mortality in CF. Chronic infection is preceded by an intermittent stage of infection. The initial stage is characteristically followed by the gradual emergence of mucoid variants of the colonizing strains and a rise in anti-Pseudomonas antibodies. In addition to optimizing existing therapeutic strategies, effective new agents need to be identified. Studies in patients with CF are particularly challenging: the progressive nature of the disease and the wide variation in severity influence considerably the outcome of drug testing. A validated, universally accepted, and clinically useful classification of patients infected with P. aeruginosa, particularly those chronically infected, is needed that can be used as both a criterion for patient selection for clinical trials and as a study endpoint.

### The etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood: a systematic review of 989 subjects [^5e760466]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Non-CF bronchiectasis in children usually has an indolent onset and presents with chronic respiratory symptoms. Cough with daily sputum production is the most common clinical presentation and may be present for years before diagnosis. Hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, pulmonary osteoarthropathy, and delayed growth are additional findings associated with non-CF bronchiectasis. The definitive diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires chest imaging usually with high resolution computed tomography.

While the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is well defined, the etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis are varied. The data presented in this review suggest that 60% of children with this disorder have an underlying etiology. Infections, primary immunodeficiencies, aspiration (both foreign body and recurrent aspiration in neurodevelopmentally challenged patients) and ciliary dyskinesia account for most cases; severe bacterial or viral pneumonias and IgG deficiencies are the most common etiologies encountered. Throughout the literature, patients without an identified etiology are reported as idiopathic disease. A focused medical history and focused laboratory investigation should reveal the etiology of non-CF bronchiectasis in many cases.

Selection bias is a major limitation of this review. Since all of the studies selected for review were retrospective in design, the possibility exists that patients may have been missed. The subjects included in this study represent 9 different countries, lending credence to the notion that the sample is unbiased. Conversely, U.S. children are underrepresented since the only American study was from Alaska. Finally, 8 of the studies selected for review reported patients from a single clinical site and 3 studies used 2 clinical sites; only 1 study employed a regional database.

Misidentification and failure to identify an etiology also contribute to the limitation of this review. Identifying multiple etiologies in individual patients occurred in 2 studies, raising the concern of over representation of specific etiologies. The selected studies contained little to no detail regarding the diagnostic approach used to identify the etiology of non-CF bronchiectasis. The absence of a detailed, unified approach to the diagnostic evaluation of these children across studies may have overestimated the number of children without a diagnosis or may have misdiagnosed an unknown number of subjects. Variability in nomenclature compounds this problem. The most common etiology of non-CF bronchiectasis was severe pneumonia, but detail regarding the infectious agent was not available. The second most common etiology was a B cell disorder; unfortunately some subjects were identified with IgG deficiency or an antibody disorder leaving the true diagnosis open to speculation.

Methods

Study population

Our study population comprised patients in the Cerner HealthFact s Electronic Health Record (EHR) database with at least two International Classification of Diseases 9th or 10th revision (ICD9/10) codes for bronchiectasis from 2009 to 2017 (Fig. 1), with no ICD9/10 codes for cystic fibrosis, and where all encounters were in inpatient or outpatient healthcare facilities reporting microbiology data. Facility characteristics are described in Table 1. We considered bronchiectasis cases to be incident if no prior encounters included a bronchiectasis ICD9/10 code for the two years preceding the first bronchiectasis ICD9/10 code (Fig. 1). We included microbiology isolates from only respiratory sites and subset to the most common species isolated, after removing non-pathogenic species and non-speciated results (Table 2). We used text searches for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and lung cancer to identify ICD codes for these conditions. We defined time under observation as the duration of time between the incident bronchiectasis encounter and the end of the study period.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^a4a428b3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of cystic fibrosis lung disease is one of chronic progression with intermittent episodes of acute worsening of symptoms frequently called acute pulmonary exacerbations These exacerbations typically warrant medical intervention. It is important that appropriate therapies are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation therefore established a committee to define the key questions related to pulmonary exacerbations, review the clinical evidence using an evidence-based methodology, and provide recommendations to clinicians. It is hoped that these guidelines will be helpful to clinicians in the treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis.

### Evaluating FEV1 decline in diagnosis and management of pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis [^577006ac]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

For each included encounter, baseline FEV1 percent predicted was defined as the average of the two highest FEV1 values in the 12 months before the encounter. FEV1 decline (ΔFEV1) was determined by the decrease from baseline FEV1 percent predicted and categorized as no change or improved from baseline, < 5% decline (ΔFEV1 < 5%), 5%−9% decline (ΔFEV1 5%−9%), or ≥ 10% decline (ΔFEV1 ≥ 10%) from baseline. Whether the treating clinician diagnosed a PEx and whether a course of antibiotics (Oral or Intravenous) was prescribed were recorded. PEx was defined as a clinical encounter with provider documentation of PEx in the encounter note or if PEx was included in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) coding for the encounter. Standardized PEx diagnostic criteria do not currently exist at Riley Hospital for Children. Chronic oral and inhaled antibiotics, or antibiotics used for Pseudomonas eradication, were not included as PEx treatments. The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved this study. HIPAA standards were maintained and consent was waived during the study.

2.2 Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients included in the study. χ² tests were performed to determine if there was significant heterogeneity between PEx groups with nonordered variables, with Mantel−Haenszel χ² tests being used to evaluate differences for ordered categorical data. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) were performed, using logistic regression analysis, to determine the odds of PEx diagnosis or antibiotic prescription for encounters with increased cough, increased sputum, or increased cough and sputum, based on ΔFEV1 (any decline, compared to remaining stable) compared to encounters with the same symptoms. Increased cough, increased sputum, and increased cough and sputum were selected for the model because they were the most frequently reported symptoms in PEx and most reliably documented in the EMR. GEEs were also performed to determine the odds of PEx diagnosis for encounters with weight loss, abnormal lung examination, or increased cough and the presence of at least one subjective symptom (fatigue, decreased appetite, fever, missed school, dyspnea, wheezing, or hemoptysis). These GEEs allow for the use of covariates in a multivariate model, adjusting for baseline FEV1 values, and to accurately account for repeated measures, as each participant could have more than one PEx encounter. All analytic assumptions were verified. Analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute).

### The etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood: a systematic review of 989 subjects [^75890272]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Protocol

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Eligibility

The study protocol was developed by the authors a priori. The inclusion criteria for this review were: (1) any clinical trial, observational study or cross-sectional case series of 10 or more patients that included a delineation of the etiologies and/or the associated conditions with bronchiectasis; (2) subjects aged 21 years or younger; (3) cystic fibrosis was excluded as a diagnosis and; (4) the diagnosis of bronchiectasis was confirmed by computed tomography of the chest. Studies of adults and children were acceptable if the pediatric data was reported separately. Case reports, editorials and review articles were excluded.

Information sources

EMBASE, Medline, OVID Cochrane Reviews, Directory of Open Access Journals, Open Science Directory, EPSCO information services, and OAlster were searched from 1966 to March 25, 2014. The bibliographies of all of the selected studies were also reviewed.

Search

The main search term was "non-CF bronchiectasis". The following filters were used: human, all children and young adult. The searches were performed independently by two of the authors and the results were compared.

Study selection

Initial evaluation of each article was performed by one author (KSB) and then reviewed by another (MTD). In cases where study populations appeared to overlap, the study with the largest number of subjects was selected. Differences in judgment were resolved first by consensus; ties were adjudicated by the third author (SCA). All studies selected for inclusion were reviewed by the third author.

Data collection

For each selected study, the following information was recorded: inclusion criteria, number of patients, age range, diagnostic criteria, patient source and country of origin. Categorical and specific etiologies of bronchiectasis were also recorded for each study. Major categories of disease included primary immunodeficiencies, ciliary dyskinesia, infection, aspiration, idiopathic or unknown, congenital malformation, secondary immunodeficiencies, asthma, skeletal disorders, bronchiolitis obliterans, and others. Within each category, specific etiologies were catalogued from those studies that provided specific data.

Walter KL. What Is Bronchiectasis. JAMA. Published online August 07, 2025. doi: 10.1001/jama.2025.11485 Patients with bronchiectasis have permanently inflamed and dilated airways. Bronchiectasis may be caused by the genetic disease cystic fibrosis or can occur in patients without CF. Approximately 500 000 people in the US have non-CF bronchiectasis.

1. The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is daily cough lasting longer than 8 to 12 weeks with clear or colored phlegm. Patients with bronchiectasis may also have shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and fatigue, and less commonly, may cough up phlegm with blood. Non-CF bronchiectasis is more common in women and older people and in patients with acid reflux, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Other risk factors include a history of pneumonia, infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria or tuberculosis, certain genetic conditions, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, and cigarette smoking. In up to 40% of cases, the cause of non-CF bronchiectasis is unknown. Bronchiectasis is diagnosed based on chest computed tomography findings of dilated airways. Chest CT may also reveal airway thickening and mucus in the airways. To evaluate the cause and severity of bronchiectasis, patients should have blood testing, sputum cultures, and pulmonary function testing with spirometry. Exacerbations of bronchiectasis are episodes of worsened disease that typically present with increased cough, dark colored sputum, and increased fatigue.

Exacerbations are associated with a decline in lung function and decreased quality of life and should be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Airway clearance techniques, which are used to expel mucus from the lungs, improve quality of life and decrease the risk of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. These methods may include forceful exhalation, use of mechanical devices, and/or chest percussion and vibration. Regular exercise and/or participation in pulmonary rehabilitation is also recommended. Patients with bronchiectasis who have asthma or COPD should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to decrease airway inflammation and help open the airways. Individuals with 3 or more exacerbations of bronchiectasis per year may benefit from use of inhaled antibiotics or daily oral antibiotics.

Surgery to remove part of the lung may be considered for some patients whose disease worsens despite medical therapy or who have resistant infections, have bronchiectasis in a single lobe of the lung, or cough up substantial amounts of blood. Bleeding may also be treated with a minimally invasive procedure that blocks bleeding in bronchial arteries. Lung transplant may be considered for patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who have severely reduced pulmonary function and/or frequent exacerbations.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults: a review [^f3aeae96]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition caused by permanent bronchial dilatation and inflammation and is characterized by daily cough, sputum, and recurrent exacerbations. Approximately 500 000 people in the US have non-CF bronchiectasis.

Observations

Non-CF bronchiectasis may be associated with prior pneumonia, infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria or tuberculosis, genetic conditions (eg, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia), autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and immunodeficiency syndromes (eg, common variable immunodeficiency). Up to 38% of cases are idiopathic. According to US data, conditions associated with non-CF bronchiectasis include gastroesophageal reflux disease (47%), asthma (29%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20%). The prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis increases substantially with age (7 per 100 000 in individuals 18–34 years vs 812 per 100 000 in those ≥ 75 years) and is more common in women than men (180 vs 95 per 100 000). Diagnosis is confirmed with noncontrast chest computed tomography showing dilated airways and often airway thickening and mucus plugging. Initial diagnostic evaluation involves blood testing (complete blood cell count with differential); immunoglobulin quantification testing (IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM); sputum cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi; and prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry. Treatment includes airway clearance techniques; nebulization of saline to loosen tenacious secretions; and regular exercise, participation in pulmonary rehabilitation, or both. Inhaled bronchodilators (β-agonists and antimuscarinic agents) and inhaled corticosteroids are indicated for patients with bronchiectasis who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbations of bronchiectasis, which typically present with increased cough and sputum and worsened fatigue, are associated with progressive decline in lung function and decreased quality of life. Exacerbations should be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Individuals with 3 or more exacerbations of bronchiectasis annually may benefit from long-term inhaled antibiotics (eg, colistin, gentamicin) or daily oral macrolides (eg, azithromycin). Lung transplant may be considered for patients with severely impaired pulmonary function, frequent exacerbations, or both. Among patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, mortality is higher for those with frequent and severe exacerbations, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Non-CF bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition that typically causes chronic cough and daily sputum production. Exacerbations are associated with progressive decline in lung function and decreased quality of life. Management involves treatment of conditions associated with bronchiectasis, airway clearance techniques, oral or intravenous antibiotics for acute exacerbations, and consideration of long-term inhaled antibiotics or oral macrolides for patients with 3 or more exacerbations annually.

### Manifestations of cystic fibrosis diagnosed in adulthood [^de4b4908]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights the phenotypic features that lead to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, and the prognosis of these patients.

Recent Findings

With the widespread availability of genetic testing and a greater appreciation of the clinical spectrum of the disease, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is being made with increasing frequency in adults. Clinical features that lead to the diagnosis include respiratory symptoms and chronic airway infection with typical cystic fibrosis pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as nontuberculous mycobacteria. Often these patients have previously received diagnoses of asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Pancreatic insufficiency is much less common in the adult receiving the diagnosis, but pancreatitis occurs with greater frequency. Occasionally, individuals receive diagnoses of apparent single-organ manifestations such as idiopathic pancreatitis or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, but with negligible involvement of the respiratory tract. On rare occasions, patients receiving the diagnosis as adults can present with classic features of the disease. Although lung disease is generally less severe in cystic fibrosis patients receiving the diagnosis as adults than in adult patients who received the diagnosis as infants, the extent of bronchiectasis can nonetheless be severe. The clinical course of patients receiving a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adulthood is largely unknown, but frequently they have milder disease and a more favorable prognosis.

Summary

Clinicians must be aware of the potential for adults with chronic respiratory tract infections, unexplained bronchiectasis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or pancreatitis to have cystic fibrosis despite the age at presentation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to initial investigations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain standardized testing in patients with bronchiectasis to identify the underlying cause, evaluate disease severity and activity, assess the risk of poor outcomes, and identify co-morbidities and associated treatable traits.

- screen all patients newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis for immunodeficiency by measuring serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis by measuring total IgE, aspergillus-specific IgG and E, as well as blood eosinophils, and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection by mycobacterial microscopy and culture

- obtain a minimum of three sputum samples or a bronchoalveolar lavage in patients at high risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection based on clinical and radiological features

- do not obtain routine α-1 antitrypsin testing, but consider performing it in patients with suggestive clinical and radiological features such as basal emphysema or severe airflow obstruction

- screen patients with symptom onset during childhood or with specific clinical or radiological features (independent of age of onset) for cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia

- calculate a bronchiectasis severity index in newly diagnosed patients with bronchiectasis to assess the risk of future complications

- identify patients at higher risk of future complications. Consider more frequent follow-up and a lower threshold for treatment in high-risk groups. Recognize that high risk groups include: patients with COPD, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or rheumatoid arthritis-associated bronchiectasis; patients with P. aeruginosa or other enteric Gram-negative infections; patients with two or more exacerbations per year or one severe exacerbation (defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics) in the previous year; patients with severe symptoms including high volumes of daily sputum production and sputum purulence; patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection; patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

- include assessment of co-morbid illnesses in the evaluation of all patients with bronchiectasis: Investigate patients at risk for associated CVD and osteoporosis; Screen patients for symptoms of anxiety and depression and initiate appropriate management; Identify and manage rhinosinusitis and GERD as common co-morbidities of bronchiectasis; Consider treatment burden and the impact on associated conditions as part of treatment decisions when managing bronchiectasis; Consider the assessments described, including the underlying cause, co-morbidities, disease activity, and treatable traits, at all patient visits and not just at diagnosis.

### The etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood: a systematic review of 989 subjects [^ba9f5464]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

While cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in childhood, non-CF bronchiectasis is associated with a wide variety of disorders. The objective of this study was to determine the relative prevalence and specific etiologies on non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood.

Methods

EMBASE, Medline, OVID Cochrane Reviews, Directory of Open Access Journals, Open Science Directory, EPSCO information services, and OAlster were searched electronically and the bibliographies of selected studies were searched manually. The search was conducted independently by 2 authors.

Study Selection

(1) any clinical trial, observational study or cross-sectional case series of 10 or more patients with a description of the conditions associated with bronchiectasis; (2) subjects aged 21 years or younger; (3) cystic fibrosis was excluded and; (4) the diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography of the chest.

Data Extraction

Patient number, age range, inclusion criteria, diagnostic criteria, patient source, and categorical and specific etiology.

Results

From 491 studies identified, 12 studies encompassing 989 children with non-CF bronchiectasis were selected. Sixty-three percent of the subjects had an underlying disorder. Infectious (17%), primary immunodeficiency (16%), aspiration (10%), ciliary dyskinesia (9%), congenital malformation (3%), and secondary immunodeficiency (3%) were the most common disease categories; 999 etiologies were identified. Severe pneumonia of bacterial or viral etiology and B cell defects were the most common disorders identified.

Conclusions

The majority of children with non-CF bronchiectasis have an underlying disorder. A focused history and laboratory investigated is recommended.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^442772e7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

In whom should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be suspected?

Recommendations

Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with persistent production of mucopurulent or purulent sputum particularly with relevant associated risk factors (D).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if they have symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections (C).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations (two or more annually) and a previous positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa while stable (B).
Consider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic productive cough (C).

Good practice points

In at-risk groups, if bronchiectasis is suspected, bronchiectasis needs confirmation.
In patients with COPD, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate especially in the presence of chronic productive cough with positive sputum cultures for potential pathogenic micro-organism (PPM) while stable or two or more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.
In patients with asthma, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with severe or poorly controlled disease.
In patients with a history of HIV-1 infection, solid organ and bone marrow transplant, and history of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma and vasculitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
In patients with other connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate if they have symptoms such as chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.
Investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate in otherwise healthy individuals with a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks, especially with sputum production or a history of an appropriate trigger (see BTS Recommendations for the management of cough in adults).

### The economic burden of bronchiectasis-known and unknown: a systematic review [^31e9b798]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The increasing prevalence and recognition of bronchiectasis in clinical practice necessitates a better understanding of the economic disease burden to improve the management and achieve better clinical and economic outcomes. This study aimed to assess the economic burden of bronchiectasis based on a review of published literature.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit and Cochrane databases to identify publications (1 January 2001 to 31 December 2016) on the economic burden of bronchiectasis in adults.

Results

A total of 26 publications were identified that reported resource use and costs associated with management of bronchiectasis. Two US studies reported annual incremental costs of bronchiectasis versus matched controls of US$5681 and US$2319 per patient. Twenty-four studies reported on hospitalization rates or duration of hospitalization for patients with bronchiectasis. Mean annual hospitalization rates per patient, reported in six studies, ranged from 0.3–1.3, while mean annual age-adjusted hospitalization rates, reported in four studies, ranged from 1.8–25.7 per 100,000 population. The average duration of hospitalization, reported in 12 studies, ranged from 2 to 17 days. Eight publications reported management costs of bronchiectasis. Total annual management costs of €3515 and €4672 per patient were reported in two Spanish studies. Two US studies reported total costs of approximately US$26,000 in patients without exacerbations, increasing to US$36,00–37,000 in patients with exacerbations. Similarly, a Spanish study reported higher total annual costs for patients with > 2 exacerbations per year (€7520) compared with those without exacerbations (€3892). P. aeruginosa infection increased management costs by US$31,551 to US$56,499, as reported in two US studies, with hospitalization being the main cost driver.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests that the economic burden of bronchiectasis in society is significant. Hospitalization costs are the major driver behind these costs, especially in patients with frequent exacerbations. However, the true economic burden of bronchiectasis is likely to be underestimated because most studies were retrospective, used ICD-9-CM coding to identify patients, and often ignored outpatient burden and cost. We present a conceptual framework to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the true burden of bronchiectasis for individuals, healthcare systems and society.

How to diagnose bronchiectasis

Primary care

The majority of respiratory tract infections seen in the primary care setting are self-limiting and do not require further investigation. In addition, the majority of patients with a chronic cough will not have bronchiectasis. In one study of 266 patients with chronic cough lasting longer than 8 weeks referred to a secondary care cough clinic and who completed follow-up, most patients had positive outcomes and did not receive a bronchiectasis diagnosis. The largest group of patients (29%) had asthma that was demonstrated by bronchodilator reversibility. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) related cough was noted in 22% and most of these patients were sensitive to proton pump inhibitor treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)-induced cough was present in 14% and resolved on withdrawal of the ACEi. Only one patient had a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Indicators of possible bronchiectasis are sputum production, which is often absent with GORD, cough variant asthma or cough hypersensitivity, and episodes of respiratory tract infections, which are also uncommon with these disorders. Fevers or night sweats with a chronic cough are unusual in bronchiectasis and suggest pulmonary tuberculosis or pulmonary non-tuberculous Mycobacterial disease in the appropriate clinical context.

Bronchiectasis should be considered as a possible diagnosis where respiratory tract infections are severe, persistent, unusual or recurrent (represented by the helpful acronym SPUR). Patients with suspected clinical signs and symptoms of bronchiectasis should be evaluated by a thorough clinical examination to rule out other possible causes and a sputum sample should be sent for microbiological analysis.

Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis are among the most common pathogens isolated from patients with bronchiectasis. Standard bacterial cultures will not identify some important bronchiectasis-associated pathogens such as NTM, but these can be excluded by requesting specific cultures for Mycobacteria. Negative sputum cultures do not exclude a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Sending samples when patients are clinically 'well' is important, as culture positive samples with chest infections are common in many conditions, but a culture positive sputum sample when the patient is well increases the likelihood that the patient has bronchiectasis.

### Pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis [^e30baf32]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has steadily increased over recent decades with a corresponding increase in the frequency of complications of the disease. Radiologists are increasingly involved with managing and identifying the pulmonary complications of CF. This article reviews the common manifestations of CF lung disease as well as updating radiologists with a number of less well-known complications of the condition. Early and accurate detection of the pulmonary effects of CF are increasingly important to prevent irreversible lung damage and give patients the greatest possibility of benefiting from the new therapies becoming available, which correct the underlying defect causing CF.

Table 1 — pointers to presence of specific cough in children lists abnormalities with example etiologies and notes the list is not exhaustive. Daily wet/productive cough is linked to protracted bacterial bronchitis, suppurative lung disease, recurrent aspiration, atypical infections, TB, and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Wheeze — monophonic indicates large airway obstruction (for example, from foreign body aspiration, malacia and/or stenosis, vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal tumors) and TB should be considered in selected settings (for example, high prevalence or HIV). Wheeze — polyphonic is associated with asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiolitis. Hoarse voice/stridor suggests laryngeal cleft/problems and airway abnormalities. Recurrent pneumonia is associated with immunodeficiency, atypical infections, suppurative lung disease, congenital lung abnormalities, and trachea-esophageal H-type fistulas. Hypoxia/cyanosis is linked to any airway or parenchyma disease and cardiac disease. Neurodevelopmental abnormality is associated with aspiration lung disease. Chest radiograph (other than peribronchial changes) or spirometry abnormality can reflect any cardiopulmonary disease. Growth failure indicates any serious systemic including pulmonary illness such as cystic fibrosis.

### Etiology and clinical characteristics of a non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis cohort in a middle Eastern population [^3638f387]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a widely prevalent airway disease characterized by airway dilatation and recurrent infections, that can lead to respiratory failure in severe cases. The etiology of bronchiectasis varies geographically, but there is a lack of published data examining its etiology specifically within the Middle Eastern population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of our bronchiectasis patient registry, extracting clinical and demographic characteristics from electronic medical records. Quantitative variables were presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages. Statistical comparisons for continuous characteristics were performed using the t-test, and significance was determined by a p-value less than 0.05.

Results

In total we analysed 260 records (63% female, 37% male), with median age of 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 38–71), Body Mass Index (BMI) 25.8(IQR 22–30), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) %predicted 65 (IQR 43–79) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) 0.76 (0.67–0.86). Sixty-five cases (25%) were post-infectious in aetiology (excluding post-TB – n:27 10.4%). Forty-eight (18.5%) patients were labelled idiopathic, while Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) accounted for 23 (8.8%) cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common colonizing organism (32.7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (9.2%) and Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus(6.9%). At the time of review, 11 patients had died (median age, FEV %predicted, and bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) 59 years, 38% and 15.5 respectively), all due to respiratory failure, and as expected, all were classed severe on BSI. The BSI score was available for 109 patients, of which 31(28%) were classed mild, 29(27%) were moderate, and 49 (45%) were classed severe. The median BSI score was 8 (IQR 4–11). On dividing the patients according to obstructive vs. restrictive spirometry, we found that patients with FEV1/FVC < 0.70 had significantly higher BSI (10.1 vs. 6.9, p-value < 0.001) and that 8 out of the 11 deceased patients had FEV1/FVC < 70%.

Conclusions

In our study, post-infectious, idiopathic, and PCD were identified as the most common etiologies of bronchiectasis. Additionally, patients with obstructive spirometry appeared to have a worse prognosis compared to those with restrictive spirometry.

### Erdosteine in children and adults with bronchiectasis (BETTER trial): study protocol for a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^aed983bc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lung disorder affecting all age groups. It is characterised clinically by recurrent or persistent wet/productive cough, lower airway infection and inflammation, and radiographically by abnormal bronchial dilatation seen on chest CT scans. Acute exacerbations identified by new or worsening respiratory symptoms are also common and are important contributors to the overall burden of disease.

The high prevalence of bronchiectasis among Indigenous children in high-income countries is well known. In remote Australian Indigenous communities of Central and Western Australia, bronchiectasis rates in children have remained stubbornly high at 1.5% during the last 20 years. In contrast, its burden among Indigenous children living in low-income and middle-income countriesand non-Indigenous children is underappreciated, despite bronchiectasis ranking only behind asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as the most common chronic pulmonary disorder worldwideresulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Deemed by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) as one of the most neglected lung diseases in clinical practice, bronchiectasis, especially in children, is relatively under-researchedand underservicedwith large unmet needs. Consequently, critical, clinically relevant gaps remain, including the absence of licensed therapies for bronchiectasis and scarce data on acute respiratory exacerbations.

### Noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children and adolescents: follow-up over a decade [^f9821cca]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is still considered an "orphan disease" in pediatric age.

Objective

The study describes the clinical and functional features, the instrumental, and microbial findings of a large cohort of patients with NCFB, followed in a single tertiary level hospital.

Methods

Children and adolescents diagnosed with NCFB from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019 were included. Data from the diagnosis and during the years of follow-up were recorded retrospectively.

Results

One hundred and thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The most common cause of NCFB was postinfectious (33%), followed by primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (30%), esophageal atresia (EA) (9.5%), and secondary immunodeficiency (9.5%). Chronic cough was the most frequent symptom. The median age of symptoms presentation was 3 years (interquartile age [IQR]: 12–84), with a precocious onset in PCD and EA groups. The median age of CT diagnosis was 9 years for all groups but PCD patients who were diagnosed at older age. Lingula, medium, upper, and lower lobes were more involved in PCD group, while diffuse distribution was observed in the postinfectious one. Microbial exams showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization higher in PCD patients (22%). Despite microbial differences in airways colonization, no difference in respiratory exacerbation rate was recorded among groups. Lung function tests demonstrated the stability of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) over time, except for the secondary immunodeficiency group.

Conclusions

The role of infections in developed countries should not be underestimated and a major effort to obtain an earlier identification of bronchiectasis should be taken. A prompt diagnosis of NFCB could help to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve the stability of lung function over time.

### Primary ciliary dyskinesia in adult bronchiectasis: data from the German bronchiectasis registry PROGNOSIS [^6f73e7ec]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by the malfunction of motile cilia and a specific etiology of adult bronchiectasis of unknown prevalence. A better understanding of the clinical phenotype of adults with PCD is needed to identify individuals for referral to diagnostic testing.

Research Question

What is the frequency of PCD among adults with bronchiectasis; how do people with PCD differ from those with other etiologies; and which clinical characteristics are independently associated with PCD?

Study Design and Methods

We investigated the proportion of PCD among the participants of the Prospective German Non-CF-Bronchiectasis Registry (PROGNOSIS) study; applied multiple imputation to account for missing data in 64 (FEV 1), 58 (breathlessness), 26 (pulmonary exacerbations), and two patients (BMI), respectively; and identified predictive variables from baseline data using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

We consecutively recruited 1,000 patients from 38 centers across all levels of the German health care system. Overall, PCD was the fifth most common etiology of bronchiectasis in 87 patients (9%) after idiopathic, postinfective, COPD, and asthma. People with PCD showed a distinct clinical phenotype. In multivariate regression analysis, the chance of PCD being the etiology of bronchiectasis increased with the presence of upper airway disease (chronic rhinosinusitis and/or nasal polyps; adjusted OR [aOR], 6.3; 95% CI, 3.3–11.9; P < .001), age < 53 years (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.7–10.4; P < .001), radiologic involvement of any middle and lower lobe (aOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.3–10.8; P = 0.016), duration of bronchiectasis > 15 years (aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.9; P < .001), and a history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation from respiratory specimen (aOR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3–4.5; P = 0.007).

Interpretation

Within our nationally representative cohort, PCD was a common etiology of bronchiectasis. We identified few easy-to-assess phenotypic features, which may promote awareness for PCD among adults with bronchiectasis.

### Cystic fibrosis | NEJM resident 360… [^9e81e6e9]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

CFTR gene is responsible for chloride transport across the epithelial cell membrane, which affects the generation of fluids in the lung, gastrointestinal system, and sweat. In the absence of a normally functioning CFTR protein, generated secretions become thicker and more viscous. The mucus generated within the lungs cannot be adequately cleared and leads to recurrent infection, chronic inflammation, and colonization with resistant organisms. CF differs from non-CF bronchiectasis in that symptoms may present in early childhood and novel therapeutics that modify the CFTR protein have been shown to improve lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life. We present a general guide to the approach to cystic fibrosis in adults. For pediatric management please refer to the Pediatric Pulmonology rotation guide. Sinus disease: Manifesting as sinusitis, recurrent infection, polyposis, and headache.

Pulmonary disease: Manifesting as daily cough with tenacious sputum production, dyspnea, intermittent hemoptysis, chest pain, and recurrent infection. Hepatobiliary disease: Biliary cirrhosis can be seen in patients due to thickened/obstructed bile. Cholelithiasis is also common. Gastrointestinal disease: Meconium ileus in a newborn is highly suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of CF. After birth, recurrent distal intestinal obstruction syndrome can occur due to viscous secretions in the bowels. DIOS manifests as a small-bowel obstruction with severe abdominal pain and an inability to pass stool or flatus.

evidence of chronic hypoxemia, including cyanosis and digital clubbing; if hypoxemia is severe, patients may develop cor pulmonale or pulmonary hypertension auscultation of the lungs is usually abnormal with varying degrees of rhonchi, wheeze, and crackles chronic cough productive of purulent sputum and exertional dyspnea. nonpulmonary physical exam findings include sinusitis, nasal polyposis, hepatosplenomegaly, and arthropathy The diagnosis of CF can be made when the following criteria are met:

1. clinical suspicion due to any of the following: positive newborn screen sibling with a diagnosis of CF. clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system 2. CFTR dysfunction as determined by: elevated sweat chloride ≥ 60 mmol/L presence of two disease-causing CFTR alleles on each parent allele abnormal nasal potential difference.

Other investigations are based on the downstream effects of CF. Detailed pulmonary investigations should be done, including pulmonary function testing, arterial blood gasses, 6-minute walk distance, and sputum culture. Pulmonary testing should be followed over time. Endocrine and nutritional markers including glycated hemoglobin, bone mineral density, fat-soluble vitamin levels, and oral glucose tolerance should also be followed. Certain treatment principles have been shown to benefit patients with CF and improve both quality of life and life span: airway clearance using inhaled medications to thin mucoid secretions physical therapy.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

Bronchiectasis identification

We identified bronchiectasis using ICD-10 code and medical terms in Chinese. To avoid missing cases when using the medical terms in Chinese, we constructed a fuzzy string matching algorithm to extract potential bronchiectasis cases from the database. Then, two pulmonary physicians performed manual verification of the diagnostic text. The flow-chart for the case ascertainment was shown in Fig. 1. The inclusion criteria for targeted cases were defined as patients with (1) bronchiectasis; (2) bronchi-, dilation; (3) primary ciliary dyskinesia; (4) ciliary dyskinesia; (5) cilia, Immotile; (6) Kartagener; (7) cystic fibrosis; or (8) ICD-10 (J74/Q33.4/O99.505/O99.502/Q89.3/E84.902/E84.900/E84.0/E84.801). The exclusion criteria were cases with (1) bronchoscopic ballon dilatation; (2) cystic fibroma; or (3) word segmentation error (such as bronchitis, dilation). Inconsistent judgements were reviewed and discussed with another senior pulmonary physician. Finally, 383,926 patients aged ≥ 18 years were identified and included as cases of bronchiectasis in our study.

### Comparative microbiome analysis in cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [^20097ca7]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic pulmonary condition characterized by the irreversible dilation of the bronchi and recurrent pulmonary infections, frequently accompanied by persistent cough and sputum production. This chronic respiratory condition can be classified into two main categories: cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Bronchiectasis can arise from various causes, including congenital conditions such as CF and primary ciliary dyskinesia, as well as acquired conditions like post-infective bronchiectasis, immune deficiency-associated bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related bronchiectasis, and idiopathic etiology.

There has been an upward trend in the number of bronchiectasis cases since 2004, which has led to a substantial increase in hospitalizations, while CF is estimated to affect at least 100,000 people worldwide. At the end of 2020, approximately 6,112 individuals were registered in the Brazilian Cystic Fibrosis Registry. Among these, 10.4% are in Rio Grande do Sul state, where this research was conducted.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guideline for the management of CRMS / CFSPID [^dbc54f76]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Working closely with PCPs is a mainstay of care for people with CRMS/CFSPID. Table 4 is a suggestion for the continued monitoring and care of people with CRMS/CFSPID and can be employed at both specialty care and primary care. Determining an appropriate time to discharge from care at a specialized center will require SDM with the people with CRMS/CFSPID, family, specialty providers and PCPs. Guidance regarding when to refer back to specialty clinics (eg, change in respiratory symptoms) needs to be developed.

We present this evidence-based guideline for the management of CRMS. Most of the recommendations were grade C because of the limited data that are currently available. As more people with CRMS/CFSPID are followed for longer periods of time, reassessment of these recommendations will be required. Additionally, research is needed to assess clinical benefits of treating pulmonary symptoms with medications commonly used for CF lung disease, antibiotic therapy for Pa in respiratory cultures, and the use of PFTs or chest imaging for monitoring development of lung disease in people with CRMS/CFSPID.

### Assessing the value of integrating national longitudinal shopping data into respiratory disease forecasting models [^fb16a566]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Between 2015 and 2019, respiratory disease (ICD 10 CODING (J00-J99)) was the underlying cause of 369,900 deaths across England and Wales. Respiratory Disease, ICD 10 CODING (J00-J99), refers to infections and disease of the lungs and respiratory system including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); bronchitis; emphysema, pneumonia and influenza. J00-J99 ICD coding does not include lung cancer, respiratory tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis. By 2020, and the arrival of the global pandemic, respiratory disease had become the leading cause of death, with COVID-19 listed on over 200,000 UK death certificates between February 2020 and July 2022. With COVID-19 appearing to have established itself as a dominant and long-standing disease, and with public health services simultaneously facing increasing financial and logistical pressures, it has become more critical than ever to investigate better forecasting of Influenza-like Illnesses (ILI) and their likely impact on local and vulnerable populations.

### Update on the role of chest imaging in cystic fibrosis [^3fa3cb6b]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease with multisystem involvement and associated morbidity and mortality that are most directly related to progressive lung disease. The hallmark findings of cystic fibrosis in the lungs are chronic inflammation and infection, leading to progressive loss of pulmonary function and often requiring lung transplant. Predominant lung findings include mucous plugging, bronchiectasis, and air trapping, often with associated atelectasis, consolidation, and emphysema; these findings form the basis of several clinical scoring systems that are used for imaging assessment. Recently, there have been major breakthroughs in the pharmacologic management of cystic fibrosis, including highly effective modulator therapies that directly target the underlying cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator molecular defect, often leading to remarkable improvements in lung function and quality of life with corresponding significant improvements in imaging markers. The authors review current guidelines regarding cystic fibrosis with respect to disease monitoring, identifying complications, and managing advanced lung disease. In addition, they discuss the evolving role of imaging, including current trends, emerging technologies, and proposed updates to imaging guidelines endorsed by international expert committees on cystic fibrosis, which favor increased use of cross-sectional imaging to enable earlier detection of structural changes in early disease and more sensitive detection of acute changes in advanced disease. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these trends and updates so that they can most effectively assist clinicians in guiding the management of patients with cystic fibrosis in all stages of disease. © RSNA, 2024.

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^7fbe6f31]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common chronic inflammatory airway diseases. They have been estimated to affect more than 5–10% of the world population –. Although both asthma and COPD remain clearly underdiagnosed, it is very important to consider that they are not the only existing chronic inflammatory airway diseases that can be clinically suspected in Primary Care, and therefore a good differential diagnosis must be made with respect to other entities. It must be borne in mind that a diagnosis is not necessarily always going to be COPD (or only COPD) in a male smoker with airflow obstruction, or asthma (or only asthma) in a non-smoking female with airflow obstruction, even though these diagnoses are correct most of the time. It is always necessary to think that these same symptoms and signs can appear in other airway diseases, and if these are correctly diagnosed a patient's follow-up and treatment may have to be altered.

Bronchiectasis is the third most common chronic inflammatory airway disease, after COPD and asthma. Its prevalence is not known, but it is estimated to be around 350–500 cases/100,000 inhabitantsand it increases rapidly with age. Its symptoms can easily be confused with those of COPD and asthma. Bronchiectasis can be caused by dozens of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases (although in up to 30–50% of cases the cause is unknown), and, as in COPD and asthma, a variable number and severity of exacerbations can appear throughout its natural history, usually with an infectious profile. A global consensus of experts recently defined bronchiectasis as a clinical-radiological disease consisting of dilation of the bronchial lumen accompanied by compatible symptoms (usually chronic cough plus expectoration with a purulent component). This dilation of the bronchial lumen is produced by a vicious circle of inflammation and chronic infection that injures the bronchial wall, producing irreversible destruction. Bronchial inflammation and infection are therefore two key points in the management of these patients –, and, as in COPD and asthma, chronic airflow obstruction is their most frequent functional pattern. In severe cases, systemic inflammation, (predominantly neutrophilicbut sometimes with a significant eosinophilic profile) is present –. In this article, we will try to offer a series of important concepts (Box 1) and practical tips (Box 2) on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis in Primary Care. However, it is important to highlight that these recommendations could vary according to the geographical area and the resources available in each respective setting.

### Imaging of congenital lung diseases presenting in the adulthood: a pictorial review [^b2c8da62]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Bronchial dilatation

Bronchial dilatation due to congenital lung diseases in adults can be listed as Mounier-Kuhn, primary ciliary dyskinesia, Williams–Campbell, and cystic fibrosis. These diseases can imitate each other and other acquired diseases which present with bronchiectasis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic aspiration and recurrent infectious diseases, severe obstructive lung diseases, and traction bronchiectasis because of interstitial lung diseases are non-congenital diseases that can mimic congenital diseases presenting with bronchial dilatation. Accompanying clinical findings and some imaging findings such as involvement of the upper or lower zones of the lung, the involvement of the main airways, or the type of bronchiectasis can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.

Mounier-Kuhn syndrome, also known as tracheobronchomegaly, is a rare disease that is most commonly seen in middle-aged men. Lack of smooth muscle and elastic fibers within the wall of the trachea and main bronchi causes dilatation and laxity of the airways, causing a marked enlargement to be seen in the inspiration phase, and airway collapse may occur in the expiration phase on CT images. The transverse diameters of the main airways are measured larger than 3 cm for the trachea, and 2.4 cm, and 2.3 cm for the main right and left bronchi, respectively. Chronic productive cough and recurrent pulmonary infections can be seen in adults and conservative treatment such as physiotherapy and postural drainage can be applied (Fig. 17).

### Baseline characteristics of patients in the Chinese bronchiectasis registry (BE-China): a multicentre prospective cohort study [^f769c8a9]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a disease with a global impact, but most published data come from high-income countries. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with bronchiectasis in China.

Methods

The Chinese Bronchiectasis Registry (BE-China) is a prospective, observational cohort enrolling patients from 111 hospitals in China. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and aetiological testing results were collected from adult patients with bronchiectasis at baseline and annual follow-up. Patients who met the inclusion criteria (age ≥ 18 years; received chest high-resolution CT in the past year showing bronchiectasis affecting one or more lung lobes; and clinical history consistent with bronchiectasis, including chronic cough, daily sputum production, and history of exacerbations) were included. Patients with known cystic fibrosis were excluded. To investigate variations according to different economic regions, two groups were compared based on whether per capita disposable income of residents was greater than US$5553. Clinical characteristics were compared with the European (EMBARC) registry and other national registries.

Findings

Between Jan 10, 2020, and March 31, 2024, 10324 patients from 97 centres were included in the study. Among 9501 participants with available data, the most common cause of bronchiectasis was post-infective disease (4101 [43.2%] patients), followed by idiopathic (2809 [29.6%] patients). 6676 (70.0%) of 9541 patients with available data had at least one exacerbation in the year before enrolment and 5427 (57.2%) of 9489 patients with available data were hospitalised at least once due to exacerbations. Treatments commonly used in high-income countries, such as inhaled antibiotics and macrolides, were infrequently used in China. Implementation of airway clearance in China was scarce, with only 1177 (12.2%) of 9647 patients having used at least one method of airway clearance. Compared with upper-middle-income regions, patients from lower-middle-income regions were younger (61.0 years [SD 14.0] vs 63.9 years [14.2]) with a higher proportion of pulmonary comorbidities (521 [17.8%] of 2922 patients vs 639 [8.6%] of 7402 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 194 [6.6%] of 2922 patients vs 364 [4.9%] of 7402 patients with asthma), a higher tuberculosis burden (442 [16.0%] of 2768 patients vs 715 [10.6%] of 6733 patients), more severe radiological involvement (1160 [42.4%] of 2736 patients vs 2415 [35.4%] of 6816 patients with cystic bronchiectasis), more exacerbations (median 1.4 [IQR 0–2] in both groups; mean 1.4 [SD 1.6] vs 1.2 [1.4] in the previous year) and hospitalisations (1662 [60.6%] of 2743 patients vs 3765 [55.8%] of 6746 patients hospitalised at least once in the previous year), and poorer quality of life (median 57.4 [IQR 53.5–63.1] vs 58.7 [54.8–64.8] assessed by the Bronchiectasis Health Questionnaire).

Interpretation

The clinical characteristics of patients with bronchiectasis in China show differences compared with cohorts in Europe and India. Bronchiectasis is more severe with a higher burden of exacerbations in lower-income regions. The management of patients with bronchiectasis in China urgently needs standardisation and improvement.

### Incidence of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalisation in persons with bronchiectasis during the COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark: a retrospective cohort study [^009c5985]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Cohort selection

Persons were included if they were alive by the first day of the reference period (12 March 2019), ≥ 18 years of age, were registered with a non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis diagnosis (ICD-10 code J47.9) in The DNPR from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2019. According to the Danish national guidelines bronchiectasis is diagnosed by thoracic high-resolution CT scan. Persons with a registered positive PCR laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 during the study were excluded. No new persons with bronchiectasis were included after 12 March 2019.

Social distancing period

The calendar period of social distancing was defined as the 10-week period 12 March 2020–22 May 2020, as this was considered the period with the most extensive law enforced lockdown restrictions in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic. No social distancing measures were introduced, or law enforced before 12 March, whereas the period after 22 May 2020 was dominated by alternating social distancing measures and a general reduction in lockdown restrictions. The lockdown measures included physical distance, social gathering avoidance and hygienic measures. Face masks were not mandatory in Denmark during this period and there was no official government recommendation to wear them. The timeline of the introduction of the social distancing measures is presented in table 1.

Outcomes

We assessed the incidence rates (IRs) of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalisation in the two 10-week periods: the social distancing period compared with the reference period. The primary outcome of the study was community-acquired pneumonia hospitalisation, defined as an admission with a diagnosis of pneumonia (ICD10-codes J12–18.9). Secondary outcomes were death from all causes and respiratory antibiotic cure — defined as collection of respiratory antibiotic prescriptions commonly used to treat mild exacerbations in bronchiectasis (ATC-codes: amoxicillin — J01CA04, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid — J01CR02) from any pharmacy.

Cystic fibrosis diagnosis — additional diagnostic application and terminology — states that for individuals presenting with CF symptoms, the same diagnostic criteria recommended for the screened population for sweat chloride testing, CFTR genetic analysis, and CFTR functional testing should be used to confirm a CF diagnosis. It adds that the diagnosis of CFTR-related disorder has been defined as a monosymptomatic clinical entity (CBAVD/pancreatitis/bronchiectasis) associated with CFTR dysfunction that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for CF, and clinicians should avoid the use of terms like classic/nonclassic CF; typical/atypical CF; delayed CF, because these terms have no harmonized definition and could be confusing for families or caregivers.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: airway clearance therapies [^db75709e]. Respiratory Care (2009). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis airway clearance therapies (ACT) purpose and assessment framework note that "In CF, mucociliary clearance is impaired due to dehydration of the aqueous layer of the airway surface liquid as a direct result of the dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein", with clinical consequences that "result in decreased mucociliary clearance, airway obstruction, recurrent respiratory infections with neutrophil migration into airways, and an exuberant inflammatory response leading to damage to lung parenchyma over time". ACT is described as using "patient maneuvers or devices to improve mucociliary clearance and augment the cough". The committee process is described as having "initially met to identify ACTs that were believed to be most commonly used in clinical practice and for which there would be peer-reviewed literature available for evaluation", with "The two primary questions used for ACT assessment" addressing "What is the efficacy of the ACT in comparison to no therapy at all?" and "What is the efficacy of the therapy in comparison to the other therapies under review?", and outcomes included "Sputum production", "Lung function", "Arterial oxygen saturation", "Exercise tolerance", "Pulmonary exacerbations", "Adverse events", "Mortality", "Quality of life measures", and "Patient preferences". The page further states that "the purpose of this Cystic Fibrosis Foundation clinical practice guideline was to evaluate and compare ACTs to provide support for clinical decision making regarding specific therapies".

### Optimizing outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis [^7516a3ef]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary exacerbations are described as worsening of the daily symptoms of cystic fibrosis airways disease, typically with increased cough and sputum production. There are often associated signs such as weight loss and reduced lung function. These events occur frequently and are associated with considerable cost and morbidity. Although approved maintenance therapies are shown to reduce exacerbations, they still occur and are associated with poor outcomes despite treatment. Guidelines to define best practices found a paucity of evidence upon which to base recommendations.

Recent Findings

There are ongoing studies that are trying to build the evidence upon which to improve our practice. Antibiotics remain a core aspect of treatment, but there is high variance in practice patterns including selection of antibiotics and duration of therapy. In addition, there is a discordance between antibiotic susceptibility test results and clinical outcomes, suggesting we need better approaches to guide antibiotic selection.

Summary

Treatment durations are highly variable but recent evidence has demonstrated worse outcomes with shorter durations; longer durations may be associated with complications of treatment, suggesting an optimal duration could be identified. New studies aim to define best practices to improve outcomes with treatment of pulmonary exacerbations.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guideline for the management of CRMS / CFSPID [^8c156876]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

CRMS/CFSPID — evidence gaps and research needs: Although numerous studies of CRMS/CFSPID have been published since 2009, most encompass single-center analyses with relatively small cohorts; the CFF Patient Registry (CFPR) contains many people with CRMS/CFSPID and has been used to study CRMS outcomes, but there is no requirement for inclusion in the CFPR and many people with CRMS/CFSPID are not represented in this database. No randomized clinical trials of people with CRMS/CFSPID have been reported, and it is unlikely that such future studies will be performed, and enrolling more people with CRMS/CFSPID into CFPR will be a primary way to develop larger multicenter cohort studies and better guide management.

### Effectiveness of treatment with high-frequency chest wall oscillation in patients with bronchiectasis [^b11827d8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is defined as an irreversible dilatation and destruction of the bronchi with a reduction in clearance of secrections (and particularly in the expiratory airflow). This disease can lead to recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and worsening pulmonary function, with increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence and the prevalence of bronchiectasis is not known, but its diagnosis has increased mainly due to the more frequent use of high-resolution computed tomography. Bronchiectasis is usually associated with chronic cough, increasing secretions, and recurrent airway and pulmonary infections. The fundamental aspects in these patients are the colonizations and infection of the bronchial mucous by potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia and others. This chronic process results in the destruction and dilatation of the bronchial tree that is the characteristic of the disease. The goals of bronchiectasis treatment are to reduce the number of exacerbations and infections and to improve patient quality of life by reducing airway inflammation and mobilizing secretions. Therapies showing to be effective in cystic fibrosis are often provided to patients with bronchiectasis, without definitive evidence of benefit. In recent years, there has been increased interest in validating and developing new therapies for patients without cystic fibrosis. These include inhaled antibiotics (tobramycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, colistin, amikacin), hyperosmolar agents (hypertonic saline solution, dry powder mannitol), anti-inflammatory agents (macrolides, corticosteroids), bronchodilators (salbutamol), chest physiotherapy, physical exercise and nutritional treatment. In the field of chest physiotherapy several secretion management techniques have been proposed: they include modified postural drainage, assisted cough, active cycle of breathing techniques, oscillatory positive-expiratory pressure devices and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. Although the mucous clearance is recommended in bronchiectasis, there are no definitive studies or guidelines on the preference or superiority of one technique versus the others. High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is widely used in the USA where is considered standard care in cystic fibrosis (CF). It has recently been introduced to UK and Europe and has been used in several other pulmonary diseases, different from CF like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchial asthma. To our knowledge there have been no trials of HFCWO in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy, the safety of HFCWO with our standard traditional chest physiotherapy (CPT) in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis.

### Risk of incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during longitudinal follow-up in patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease [^f0b94754]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite its strengths, this study had several limitations. First, NTM-PD was diagnosed based on the presence of ICD-10 codes and microbiological findings. Therefore, patients with mild or asymptomatic NTM-PD or undiagnosed NTM-PD, such as cases where NTM species were isolated from only one sputum specimen, might not have been included in this study. Second, the incidence of COPD was higher in study 1 than in study 2. The potential reasons for overestimation in study 1 are as follows: (1) Study 1 was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital with a large number of patients with NTM-PD. The patients with NTM-PD in the present study were likely to experience more severe disease (and were more prone to developing COPD) compared to those with NTM-PD in general. (2) We defined newly diagnosed COPD as the first detected airflow obstruction using pre-bronchodilator spirometry results. Thus, a transient airflow obstruction could have been captured as COPD, and pre-bronchodilator airflow obstruction could have overestimated COPD. (3) Study 2 defined COPD as the ICD-10 codes for COPD and use of bronchodilators. Since patients with ICD-10 codes for COPD who were not under treatment were not considered as having COPD, this could also lead to the discrepancy in the prevalence of COPD between the studies. Fourth, as this study utilized data extracted from the CDW and NHIS-NSC, we lacked information on the presence and extent of coexisting bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, clinical phenotype of NTM-PD (nodular bronchiectasis or fibrocavitary), and severity of NTM-PD. In evaluating the association between NTM-PD and COPD risk, we were unable to consider some important variables, such as bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis due to the following reasons: Our study relied on formal interpretations of chest CT findings by radiologists, who sometimes omit detailed descriptions of bronchiectasis and/or fibrosis when interpreting CT findings of patients with NTM-PD. Consequently, the presence of bronchiectasis and/or fibrosis may be underreported. Additionally, clinicians often record the ICD-10 code for NTM-PD while omitting codes for bronchiectasis or fibrosis. Given these constraints, bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis were not included in our study. Further studies with more detailed information are required to explore the association between NTM-PD and COPD. Fifth, our study spans a considerable period during which both the prevalence and awareness of NTM-PD have increased substantially. This could have influenced the timing of diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment for NTM-PD, potentially affecting the observed association between NTM-PD and the development of COPD. Future studies are warranted to address these remaining questions. Finally, as this study was conducted in South Korea, the generalizability of the results to other ethnic groups or countries may be limited.

### Evaluating hemoptysis hospitalizations among patients with bronchiectasis in the United States: a population-based cohort study [^6895c5b3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methodology

The study cohort was derived from the 2016 and 2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is a large publicly available all-payer database produced and maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Rockville, MD). The NIS provides demographic and administrative data from a 20% stratified random sample of non-federal acute-care hospitals in the US. The study was conducted in accordance with the methodological standards previously published and all investigators had permission to use the data. Given that this study was done using only a publicly available database, ethics approval was not required.

Variable definitions

The International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes were used to identify hospitalizations containing primary or secondary diagnoses of both hemoptysis (R04.2, R04.9) and bronchiectasis (J47.0, J47.1, J47.9). Adults 18 years and older with non-elective admissions were included. Hospitalizations containing ICD-10 codes for bronchogenic malignancy, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, iatrogenic hemoptysis related to a procedure, and vasculitis were excluded. Comorbidities were computed with the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software for ICD-10-CM (which includes hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and diabetes with or without complications) and analysis was adjusted for the number of comorbidities (0, 1–2, ≥ 3). Other data elements from the NIS database were also collected including: age, sex, race, median household income, admission on the weekend, number of procedures, BAE, bronchoscopy, pulmonary mycobacterial infection, pneumonia due to pseudomonas, other pulmonary aspergillosis, Hemophilus influenza infection, sequelae of tuberculosis. Hospitalization costs were calculated by combining charges data with the cost-to-charge ratio files provided by HCUP in order to create standardized costs.

### Pneumothorax in cystic fibrosis [^1f61405f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic disease affecting many organs, although 85% of the mortality is a result of lung disease. The natural history of the lung disease consists of early and persistent infection, an exaggerated inflammatory response, structural airway changes (i.e. bronchiectasis), and progressive airways obstruction, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure. As airways disease worsens, there is an increased likelihood of respiratory complications, such as pneumothorax, that may be serious. This review describes our current understanding of the pathogenesis of pneumothorax in CF and its treatment.

Recent Findings

The CF Foundation Pulmonary Therapies Committee recently published their recommendations for the treatment of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. As insufficient data exist from which a systematic review of the literature could be used to develop guidelines, the recommendations were derived from a formalized expert panel consensus process.

Summary

We now have recommendations on specific care of the patient with CF who has a pneumothorax.

### Characteristics and health-care utilization history of patients with bronchiectasis in US Medicare enrollees with prescription drug plans, 2006 to 2014 [^4d67fd5d]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is an increasingly common chronic inflammatory airway disease. There is an urgent need to understand the epidemiology of bronchiectasis in older adults. We describe the prevalence and characteristics of patients with bronchiectasis within the US Medicare population.

Methods

Among the 40% of Medicare enrollees with prescription drug plans from 2006 to 2014, we identified patients ≥ 65 years of age with bronchiectasis by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification claims (494.0 or 494.1) from a pulmonologist and no claim for cystic fibrosis. We calculated the prevalence from 2012 to 2014. Incident or newly diagnosed patients were those enrolled in Medicare at least 12 months prior to the first bronchiectasis diagnosis. We described clinical and health-care utilization characteristics for this cohort during the prior 12-month (baseline) period, and explored differences between those with and without a COPD diagnosis.

Results

We identified 252,362 patients with bronchiectasis meeting all eligibility criteria. The average annual prevalence from 2012 to 2014 was 701 per 100,000 persons. Newly diagnosed patients were a mean age of 76 years, predominately women (65%), and predominately white, non-Hispanic (84%). During the baseline period, 12% were hospitalized for respiratory infections. Fifty-one percent had a dual diagnosis of COPD. Newly diagnosed patients with bronchiectasis and COPD had significantly different characteristics and utilization, for example were more likely hospitalized for respiratory infections during the baseline period (16% vs 7%) and to have a smoking history (46% vs 17%) compared with those without a dual COPD diagnosis, respectively.

Conclusions

We confirmed a high prevalence of bronchiectasis in the United States and significant heterogeneity in patients with bronchiectasis with and without COPD that should be further explored.

### Clinical characteristics and etiologies of bronchiectasis in Korean children: a multicenter retrospective study [^a68c1730]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by progressive and irreversible bronchial dilatation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the etiologies and clinical features of bronchiectasis in Korean children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of the medical records for children diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2000 and 2017 at 28 secondary or tertiary hospitals in South Korea.

Results

A total of 387 cases were enrolled. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.2 ± 5.1 years and 53.5% of the patients were boys. The most common underlying cause of bronchiectasis was preexisting respiratory infection (55.3%), post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (14.3%), pulmonary tuberculosis (12.3%), and heart diseases (5.6%). Common initial presenting symptoms included chronic cough (68.0%), recurrent pneumonia (36.4%), fever (31.1%), and dyspnea (19.7%). The most predominantly involved lesions were left lower lobe (53.9%), right lower lobe (47.1%) and right middle lobe (40.2%). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of these involved lesions by etiology. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) levels were lowest in cases with interstitial lung disease-associated bronchiectasis, followed by those with recurrent aspiration and primary immunodeficiency.

Conclusions

Bronchiectasis should be strongly considered in children with chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia. Long-term follow-up studies on pediatric bronchiectasis are needed to further clarify the prognosis and reduce the disease burden in these patients.

### Evaluating hemoptysis hospitalizations among patients with bronchiectasis in the United States: a population-based cohort study [^a00f6bd4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (hereafter referred to as "bronchiectasis") is a chronic suppurative lung disease characterized by chronic productive cough and episodic infectious exacerbations. Though formerly classified as an orphan disease, its prevalence has steadily increased by ~ 8% per year in the United States (US). In 2013, an estimated 340, 000 people in the US were receiving active treatments for this disease. Hospitalizations can be frequent and account for most of the economic burden. Numerous clinical trials and guidelines have been published over the past decade and therapies like macrolides are now recommended to prevent bronchiectasis exacerbations. There are contraindications to chronic macrolide use though, such as infection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which can develop resistance if macrolide monotherapy is used.

Hemoptysis is a well-known and feared complication of bronchiectasis, ranging from chronic small volumes to massive hemoptysis that can be life-threatening. Chronic airway inflammation and infection can lead to hemoptysis but life-threatening hemoptysis may be due to a rupture of a tortuous blood vessel. Bronchiectasis is a common etiology in hemoptysis presentations. In a French cohort of bronchiectasis patients, 1 in 5 patients had a history of hemoptysis. Hemoptysis was a symptom in 23% of patients in a US bronchiectasis research registry.

Therapeutic approaches to managing bronchiectasis-related hemoptysis depend on the clinical severity but include supportive management such as suspension of certain airway clearance techniques, treatment of pulmonary infection, bronchoscopic techniques, bronchial artery embolization (BAE), and surgical resection. BAE has emerged as a first-line treatment for the control of hemoptysis from a variety of causes, including tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and aspergilloma. Major complication from BAE are reportedly rare, but the recurrence of hemoptysis is common varying between 10 to 57%.

The published literature demonstrates a significant economic burden with bronchiectasis management, but there is scarce data on the burden of hospitalizations or mortality rates from hemoptysis or the utilization rates of BAE among the bronchiectasis population in the US. In order to gain a better understanding of the resource and economic impacts of this serious complication, we used a national public database to determine the hospitalization incidence and outcomes of hemoptysis presentations including in-hospital mortality among those with bronchiectasis.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^f77087d8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Cystic fibrosis is a recessive genetic disease characterized by dehydration of the airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, individuals with the disease have difficulty clearing pathogens from the lung and experience chronic pulmonary infections and inflammation. Death is usually a result of respiratory failure. Newly introduced therapies and aggressive management of the lung disease have resulted in great improvements in length and quality of life, with the result that the median expected survival age has reached 36 years. However, as the number of treatments expands, the medical regimen becomes increasingly burdensome in time, money, and health resources. Hence, it is important that treatments should be recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety.

Objectives

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation therefore established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for each therapy and to provide guidance for the prescription of these therapies.

Methods

The committee members developed and refined a series of questions related to drug therapies used in the maintenance of pulmonary function. We addressed the questions in one of three ways, based on available evidence: (1) commissioned systematic review, (2) modified systematic review, or (3) summary of existing Cochrane reviews.

Conclusions

It is hoped that the guidelines provided in this article will facilitate the appropriate application of these treatments to improve and extend the lives of all individuals with cystic fibrosis.

### Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: consensus guidelines from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^7eff4892]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation consensus guidelines — diagnostic recommendations state: It is recommended that diagnoses associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations in all individuals, from newborn to adult, be established by evaluation of CFTR function with a sweat chloride test; the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project classifications should be used to aid in diagnosis; newborns with a high immunoreactive trypsinogen level and inconclusive CFTR function and genetic testing may be designated CFTR-related metabolic syndrome or CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis, these terms are now merged and equivalent, and CFTR-related metabolic syndrome/CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis may be used; International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision codes for use in diagnoses associated with CFTR mutations are included.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^6e3852ef]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis chronic medications — recommended chronic therapies: For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, with moderate to severe lung disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, the CF Foundation strongly recommends the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin to improve lung function and quality of life, and reduce exacerbations. For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, with mild lung disease and P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, the CF Foundation recommends the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations. For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, with moderate to severe lung disease, the CF Foundation strongly recommends the chronic use of dornase alfa to improve lung function, improve the quality of life, and reduce exacerbations. For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, with asymptomatic or mild lung disease, the CF Foundation recommends the chronic use of dornase alfa to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations. For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, the CF Foundation recommends the chronic use of inhaled hypertonic saline to improve lung function and quality of life and reduce exacerbations. For individuals with CF, 6 years of age and older, with P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, the CF Foundation recommends the chronic use of azithromycin to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations.

### The etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis in childhood: a systematic review of 989 subjects [^fb03a58a]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Synthesis of results

The categorical and specific etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis were pooled to provide estimates of the relative prevalence for each disorder. Total sample size estimates for categorical comparisons were calculated from the total number of etiologies identified for the entire review. Total sample size estimates for the comparison of specific etiologies within individual categories were calculated from the total number of etiologies reported in a given category.

Sources of bias across studies

Patient sampling by number, locale and institution raised the concern of population homogeneity and possible over- or under-representation of a specific area or ethnic group. Variability in diagnostic evaluation and the identification of multiple etiologies for individual patients were also potential sources of bias in defining etiology. Inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature were a potential source of error when studies were combined.
