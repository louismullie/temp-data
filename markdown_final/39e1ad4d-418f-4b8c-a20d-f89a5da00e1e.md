## Question

Jardiance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Jardiance (empagliflozin), specifically seeking information on its drug identity and mechanism of action, FDA-approved indications and key limitations, pivotal clinical trials and outcomes across diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, dosing, renal function considerations, perioperative management, safety, adverse effects, special populations, emerging research, and cost/access issues, with a summary of practical clinical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its mechanism. Empagliflozin is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor that blocks proximal tubular glucose and sodium reabsorption, increasing urinary glucose excretion and producing osmotic diuresis. It also lowers intraglomerular pressure via tubuloglomerular feedback, which likely contributes to cardiorenal benefits beyond glycemic control [^114tRMz8] [^113ifqV2].

> I need to verify the labeled indications and limitations. The FDA approves empagliflozin to reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in adults with heart failure regardless of ejection fraction, to slow kidney disease progression and reduce kidney failure and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression, to reduce cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, and to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, it is not recommended for type 1 diabetes due to ketoacidosis risk and is ineffective for glycemic control when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and it is not indicated for certain CKD etiologies such as polycystic kidney disease or in patients on high-dose immunosuppression [^115WjsaV].

> Next, I should review the cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial in 7,020 patients with T2DM and established CVD showed a 14% reduction in 3-point MACE and a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death, with benefits emerging early and largely driven by reduced CV mortality rather than fewer MIs or strokes; the trial population was predominantly male, mean age 63, with mean HbA1c 8.1% and eGFR 74 mL/min/1.73 m², and most patients were on background ACEi/ARB, beta-blockers, and statins [^114xVv9U] [^115a3VDn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about heart failure benefits being limited to diabetic patients. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial in HFrEF and EMPEROR-Preserved in HFpEF demonstrated consistent reductions in the composite of CV death or heart failure hospitalization regardless of diabetes status, with benefits largely driven by fewer HF hospitalizations. These data support a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors for HF across the EF spectrum and underpin the HF indication independent of diabetes [^116eLTy2] [^113Pajoc].

> I will now examine kidney outcomes. In EMPA-KIDNEY, empagliflozin 10 mg reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in a broad CKD population including many without diabetes, with consistent effects across eGFR and albuminuria strata. Mediation analyses from EMPA-REG suggest that increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin — markers of plasma volume contraction and possible erythropoietic effects — mediate much of the renal benefit, aligning with hemodynamic and tubular mechanisms [^112duwjk] [^1118bpo8].

> Let me think about glycemic efficacy and dose. Standard dosing is 10 mg once daily, with an option to increase to 25 mg if additional glycemic lowering is needed and tolerated. In T2DM, placebo-subtracted HbA1c reductions average about 0.6–0.7% at 25 mg, with greater absolute reductions at higher baseline HbA1c, and efficacy wanes as eGFR declines below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², becoming negligible below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to reduced filtered glucose load [^11675pBq] [^115xgBLx] [^112VMnzj].

> Wait, I should double-check pediatric data. The DINAMO trial in youth aged 10–17 with T2DM showed superiority of empagliflozin to placebo for HbA1c lowering, with a higher observed hypoglycemia rate than placebo but no severe hypoglycemia; this supports the pediatric indication for ages 10 and older, with attention to concomitant insulin and monitoring needs [^116Atn1r] [^113viz4T].

> I need to ensure renal function guidance is precise. For glycemic control, avoid initiation if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; for HF or CKD indications, initiation is appropriate down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² based on trial enrollment, and if a patient on therapy deteriorates below 20 or starts dialysis, continuation can be considered case-by-case given consistent safety signals across eGFR subgroups in the major trials; monitor for volume depletion and adjust interacting agents as needed [^113viz4T] [^115WjsaV].

> Next, I should review perioperative management. Because SGLT2 inhibitors increase ketoacidosis risk in the setting of prolonged fasting, reduced insulin, or acute illness, empagliflozin should be held at least 3 days before major surgery or procedures with prolonged fasting and resumed when the patient is clinically stable with oral intake. This is especially critical in patients with type 1 diabetes or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes [^11675pBq] [^116gybcw].

> Let me consider adverse effects and safety. Common adverse effects include genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, and a modest increase in urinary tract infections. Serious but rare events include euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, Fournier's gangrene, and urosepsis. In older adults, rates of volume depletion and UTIs are higher, warranting cautious initiation and hydration counseling. There is no clinically meaningful QT prolongation at therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses [^115QDYuy] [^117LRXDw] [^114tRMz8].

> But wait, what about amputations and malignancy signals. Unlike canagliflozin, empagliflozin did not show a consistent amputation signal in EMPA-REG. In EMPA-KIDNEY, lower limb amputation rates were numerically close between empagliflozin and placebo, and a large European post-authorization study found no increased risk of urinary tract cancers with empagliflozin compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, which reassures on malignancy concerns raised from preclinical data [^1158SFu2].

> I should confirm special populations and drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed for hepatic impairment, and empagliflozin has minimal clinically relevant interactions with common cardiovascular and antidiabetic agents; in pregnancy, avoid use due to fetal risk, and breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment [^112cp8a4] [^116kZL9R] [^111z18Ke].

> Let me review emerging research briefly. Small studies using an SGLT-specific PET tracer suggest SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake in astrocytomas and inhibition by empagliflozin, raising a mechanistic rationale for trials exploring antitumor effects. However, these are preliminary translational data and should not alter current clinical use outside trials [^1123jGBo] [^1167v8gA].

> I need to check access and cost considerations. SGLT2 inhibitors vary widely in price internationally, with substantially lower costs in the UK and India compared with the US; nonetheless, cost-effectiveness modeling in T2DM with CVD suggests favorable value at US pricing, supporting payer coverage in appropriate populations [^116mAo9Z].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical takeaways. Empagliflozin is a first-line cardio-renal agent in T2DM with ASCVD or CKD and is indicated for HF regardless of diabetes; prioritize initiation in patients with eGFR at least 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m² depending on indication, hold perioperatively, counsel on genital infections and hydration, and monitor renal function and volume status; the early, mortality- and HF-driven benefits distinguish this class from many other glucose-lowering therapies and justify its expanded indications beyond glycemic control [^116a85c9] [^115WjsaV] [^1115sr2E].

Jardiance (empagliflozin) is an SGLT2 inhibitor that lowers blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion [^114tRMz8] and provides **cardiorenal benefits** beyond glycemic control [^112WhegG]. It is approved for type 2 diabetes [^115WjsaV], heart failure [^115WjsaV], and chronic kidney disease [^115WjsaV], with **reduced cardiovascular death** [^115a3VDn] and heart failure hospitalizations [^113Pajoc]. Common adverse effects include genital mycotic infections [^115QDYuy], urinary tract infections, and volume depletion [^113viz4T]; rare but serious risks include ketoacidosis [^115HKt3R] and Fournier's gangrene [^115QDYuy]. Dosing is 10–25 mg daily [^11675pBq], with dose adjustment based on renal function [^113viz4T]; it is not recommended for type 1 diabetes [^115WjsaV] or severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) for glycemic control [^115WjsaV].

---

## Mechanism of action

Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubules [^113ifqV2], reducing glucose and sodium reabsorption and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion and promoting osmotic diuresis [^113ifqV2]. This insulin-independent mechanism also lowers blood pressure and intraglomerular pressure [^114tRMz8] [^113ifqV2], contributing to **cardiorenal benefits** [^112WhegG].

---

## Clinical indications

Empagliflozin is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)**: Improves glycemic control as adjunct to diet and exercise [^115WjsaV] [^112VMnzj].

- **Heart failure**: Reduces risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic heart failure [^115WjsaV] (both HFrEF and HFpEF) [^116eLTy2] [^113Pajoc].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduces risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with CKD at risk of progression [^115WjsaV] [^112duwjk].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Glycemic control

Empagliflozin significantly reduces HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in T2DM [^113SxbyX], with **dose-dependent effects** (10 mg: −0.62% HbA1c; 25 mg: −0.66% HbA1c) [^112VMnzj]. Efficacy diminishes with declining renal function [^115xgBLx], and it is ineffective for glycemic control when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115WjsaV].

---

### Cardiovascular outcomes

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits in T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease, including a **38% reduction in cardiovascular death** [^115a3VDn] and a **35% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations** [^113Pcq6P]. These benefits were consistent across subgroups, including patients with and without baseline heart failure [^113Pcq6P].

---

### Renal outcomes

Empagliflozin significantly slows CKD progression [^112duwjk], reducing the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESRD, and renal death in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^notfound]. Renal benefits are observed in both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients [^111jFD2C].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Empagliflozin is **generally well tolerated** [^117LfDK5]. Common adverse effects include:

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Genital mycotic infections | Common | Usually mild, manageable |
| Urinary tract infections | Common | Usually mild, manageable |
| Volume depletion | Common | Monitor in elderly, diuretic users, renal impairment |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Rare | Serious, monitor in T1DM, insulin deficiency |
| Fournier's gangrene | Rare | Serious, requires immediate medical attention |

---

Empagliflozin is **not recommended for type 1 diabetes** [^115WjsaV] due to increased ketoacidosis risk [^115HKt3R] and is not indicated for glycemic control in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^115WjsaV].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Standard dose**: 10 mg once daily, taken orally in the morning with or without food [^11675pBq].

- **Dose adjustment**: May increase to 25 mg once daily if additional glycemic control is needed and tolerated [^11675pBq].

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment based on renal function; not recommended for glycemic control if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^11675pBq].

- **Perioperative management**: Withhold at least 3 days before major surgery or prolonged fasting, resume when clinically stable [^11675pBq].

---

## Patient populations and special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk of volume depletion and urinary tract infections; monitor closely [^117LRXDw].

- **Pediatric patients**: Approved for T2DM in patients aged ≥ 10 years; safety and efficacy established in clinical trials [^116Atn1r].

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Not recommended due to potential fetal risk; avoid breastfeeding during treatment [^111z18Ke].

---

## Comparison with other SGLT2 inhibitors

Empagliflozin shares a class mechanism with other SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin) [^113fdeWD]. It has **distinct cardiovascular and renal benefits** [^112WhegG], with robust evidence from EMPA-REG OUTCOME [^115a3VDn] and EMPA-KIDNEY [^112duwjk] trials supporting its use in T2DM with CVD and CKD.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines recommend empagliflozin as a **first-line therapy** for T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease or CKD, given its proven cardiovascular and renal benefits [^115WjsaV]. It is also recommended for heart failure management regardless of diabetes status [^1115sr2E].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing research explores empagliflozin's role in **type 1 diabetes** [^115m5kAT], obesity management [^1147WYxr], and potential anticancer effects via SGLT2 inhibition in tumors [^1123jGBo]. Future studies may further define its role in these areas and optimize dosing strategies [^115m5kAT].

---

Empagliflozin (Jardiance) is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor with **proven glycemic, cardiovascular, and renal benefits** [^112WhegG]. It is well tolerated, with manageable adverse effects, and is recommended for T2DM, heart failure, and CKD patients.

4 DISCUSSION

Using a large PK database to derive drug exposure combined with the baseline characteristics and outcome measures from the type 1 diabetes empagliflozin clinical trial programme, we were able to determine that the directly observed 26‐week mean placebo‐corrected HbA1c reduction of −0.28% from baseline in the empagliflozin 2.5 mg arm of the EASE‐3 trial was confirmed to be similar in two independent modelling and simulation studies. Specifically, the HbA1c change according to these models was −0.29% at 26 weeks, sustained over 52 weeks, and greater with higher baseline HbA1c. The approach predicted that greater efficacy could be achieved on a stable insulin dose compared with one in which insulin dose was adjusted at the initiation of empagliflozin treatment.

While, in retrospect, the full phase 3 SGLT‐2 inhibitor clinical trial programmes for type 1 diabetes could have investigated lower type 1 diabetes‐specific effective doses to minimize DKA risk, such an approach was assessed only in one trial within the empagliflozin phase 3 programme, in addition to the evaluation in the phase 2 trial (EASE‐1). 9 Traditionally, two phase 3 trials are required for regulatory approval. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act permits the determination of effectiveness to be based on "data from one adequate and well‐controlled investigation and confirmatory evidence". 13 The FDA has also provided guidance on exposure‐response relationships that states, "Exposure‐response studies can support, or in some cases provide primary evidence for the approval of different doses" of pharmacotherapies that have been investigated at different doses in controlled clinical trials to contribute to existing evidence for substantial efficacy. 13, 21, 22 The phase 3 clinical trial programme for empagliflozin, in particular, lends itself very well to the generation of model‐informed supportive evidence.

### Empagliflozin and HFrEF: known and possible benefits of NHE1 inhibition [^115RqNxH]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin has cardiac and extracardiac protective actions, including enhanced diuretic efficiency, renal protection, augmented cardiac substrate metabolism (i.e. enhanced ketone formation and utilization), and decreased vascular stiffness. Moreover, empagliflozin can inhibit transforming growth factor-beta–induced fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and fibrosis, as well as reduce production of the proinflammatory adipokine leptin and increase production of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin. In terms of empagliflozin's primary cardiac effects, an essential study by Byrne et al. conducted in mice with pressure overload–induced HF, revealed that empagliflozin-treated hearts exhibited significantly improved cardiac output and cardiac work ex vivo, with no differences in heart rate; these findings suggest improved cardiac contractility independent of and in addition to changes in vascular resistance. However, mechanisms accounting for these primary cardiac effects remained unclear. Among its other merits, the current research by Iborra-Egea et al. contributes to filling this gap by confirming and expanding previous evidence attesting that NHE1 is a primary target of empagliflozin in the heart. Baartscheer et al. had already reported that empagliflozin reduces [Na +] and [Ca 2+] in isolated ventricular myocytes, independently from the presence of glucose but in a manner sensitive to the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide, thus suggesting that empagliflozin inhibits this antiporter. More recently, Bertero et al. advanced the "sodium hypothesis" according to which "… empagliflozin may reduce intracellular sodium (Na +) load observed in failing cardiac myocytes by inhibiting the sarcolemmal Na + /H + exchanger. Because elevated intracellular Na + hampers mitochondrial Ca 2+ handling and thereby, deteriorates energy supply and demand matching and the mitochondrial antioxidative defense systems, empagliflozin may positively affect cardiac function by restoring mitochondrial function, and redox state in the failing heart". Accordingly, the long-term ablation of NHE1 activity enhances the myocyte redox potential and mitigates high-fat diet-induced myocardial stress and fatty liver disease, leading to better-preserved insulin sensitivity, while potentially altering both cardiac and systemic metabolic substrate handling in mice.

### Post-authorisation safety study to assess the risk of urinary tract cancer in people with type 2 diabetes initiating empagliflozin: a multi-country European study [^1158SFu2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is affecting an increasing number of people globally. According to the 2021 International Diabetes Federation estimates, the number of people with diabetes in Europe will rise from an estimated 61 million in 2021 to 69 million by 2045.

Empagliflozin, a selective sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), was approved in the European Union, including the United Kingdom (UK), in 2014 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve glycaemic control in adults by reducing renal glucose reabsorption.

Urinary tract cancers (UTCs) were included as a potential risk at the time of the initial approval in 2014 in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Jardiance® (empagliflozin) and Synjardy® (empagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride). This was based on preclinical toxicology findings and clinical cases observed with another SGLT2i. However, little evidence is available on the potential risk increase of UTC associated with empagliflozin use. Clinical data on empagliflozin have not identified or established a potential mechanism for the development of malignancies.

As part of the RMP, this post‐authorisation safety study (PASS), utilizing real‐world data collected from routine clinical practice, was requested by the European Medicines Agency. This study aimed to assess the risk of UTC in people with T2D initiating empagliflozin compared with people initiating any dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i) in the UK, Sweden, and Finland. In addition, the risks of bladder and renal cancers were assessed separately.

Empagliflozin in Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials

The favorable data emerging from the various empagliflozin Phase I clinical trials set the stage for subsequent Phase II and Phase III studies in various patient populations. While several trials are ongoing, a number have already been reported in the peer-reviewed literature.

Phase II Trials

In a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and PK of empagliflozin were evaluated in patients with T2DM. The investigators randomized 408 patients (treatment-naïve or having completed a 4-week washout) to empagliflozin (5, 10, or 25 mg once daily), placebo, or open-label metformin for 12 weeks. At baseline, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) HbA1c level across all groups was 7.9 ± 0.8%. After 12 weeks, dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c from baseline were seen in the empagliflozin-treated patients (5 mg −0.4%, 10 mg −0.5%, 25 mg −0.6%; p < 0.0001 for all doses vs. placebo +0.1%). Patients in the open-label metformin arm had similar reductions in HbA1c levels of −0.7%, but the metformin arm was not designed to be tested for significance against the double-blind groups.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VMnzj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and safety of the novel sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin compared with placebo or other antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library through December 2013 and grey literature. Two reviewers working independently extracted relevant data and carried out risk-of-bias assessments. We synthesized results using random-effects models and computed weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (ORs).

Results

We included 10 studies with 6203 participants. Compared with placebo, mean changes in haemoglobin A1c were -0.62% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.68 to -0.57%] for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.66% (-0.76 to -0.57%) for empagliflozin 25 mg. Empagliflozin 25 mg daily had glycaemic efficacy similar to metformin or sitagliptin (WMD -0.11%; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.03%), without increasing risk for hypoglycaemia. It was also associated with body weight loss (WMD -1.84; 95% CI -2.30 to -1.38 kg vs. placebo) and had a favourable effect on blood pressure. Incidence of hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin was similar to placebo (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.39); nevertheless we noted an increased risk for genital tract infections (OR 3.31; 95% CI 1.55 to 7.09). Findings were similar for the 10-mg dosing regimen.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin effectively lowers blood glucose and provides additional clinical benefits including body weight and blood pressure reduction. Ongoing trials will elucidate the long-term safety and effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^115a3VDn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

JARDIANCE significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 15 and Figures 5 and 6). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

The efficacy of JARDIANCE on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with JARDIANCE, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ™) [^113Bn3My]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The primary analysis will be based on a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment (with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg pooled into a single group), age, gender, baseline BMI (< 30 kg/m 2, ≥ 30 kg/m 2), baseline HbA 1c (< 8.5%, ≥ 8.5%), baseline eGFR as well as geographical region (classified as North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia) as factors. The same Cox proportional hazards model as for the primary outcome will be employed in all steps of the hierarchical testing strategy (3P-MACE and 4P-MACE).

The time to the occurrence of the primary outcome and the key secondary outcomes event will be computed as (event date - randomization date) +1. Patients who do not have the event during the trial period will be censored at the individual day of trial completion. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual day of trial completion – randomization date) + 1. For patients who have more than one primary outcome event during the trial, the time to the first occurrence of the primary outcome event will be considered for the primary analysis. All adjudicated and confirmed events will be used for the primary analysis.

The TS is the basis for the primary analysis and the FAS is the basis for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for efficacy analyses. As sensitivity analyses the primary analysis will also be performed for the OS. Secondary analyses of the primary analysis with pooled active treatment arms will be performed by comparing the active treatments individually versus the placebo arm. Sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary outcomes will be performed that include the additional factor of naïve/experienced drug status in the Cox model. The secondary and tertiary further cardiovascular outcomes will be analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model similar to the primary analysis for the treated set. Of note is that also other sensitivity analysis will be conducted employing other statistical methods, as well as an assessment of outcomes per individual dosages (i.e. empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg).

### SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin: finally at the latter stage of understanding? [^114tsbQo]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new adjunctive treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extraglycemic benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition include weight and blood pressure reduction. Cherney et al. now demonstrate that these extraglycemic properties of empagliflozin are preserved despite reduced urinary glucose excretion in advancing chronic kidney disease. Limited therapeutic options for patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter stages of chronic kidney disease make empagliflozin an attractive therapeutic agent with additional cardiovascular benefits.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ™) [^112uskmP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence concerning the importance of glucose lowering in the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes remains controversial. Given the multi-faceted pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in diabetes, it is likely that any intervention to mitigate this risk must address CV risk factors beyond glycemia alone. The SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin improves glucose control, body weight and blood pressure when used as monotherapy or add-on to other antihyperglycemic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the ongoing EMPA-REG OUTCOME™ trial is to determine the long-term CV safety of empagliflozin, as well as investigating potential benefits on macro-/microvascular outcomes.

Methods

Patients who were drug-naïve (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 9.0%), or on background glucose-lowering therapy (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.0%), and were at high risk of CV events, were randomized (1:1:1) and treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo (double blind, double dummy) superimposed upon the standard of care. The primary outcome is time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. CV events will be prospectively adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee. The trial will continue until ≥ 691 confirmed primary outcome events have occurred, providing a power of 90% to yield an upper limit of the adjusted 95% CI for a hazard ratio of < 1.3 with a one-sided α of 0.025, assuming equal risks between placebo and empagliflozin (both doses pooled). Hierarchical testing for superiority will follow for the primary outcome and key secondary outcomes (time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris) where non-inferiority is achieved.

Results

Between Sept 2010 and April 2013, 592 clinical sites randomized and treated 7034 patients (41% from Europe, 20% from North America, and 19% from Asia). At baseline, the mean age was 63 ± 9 years, BMI 30.6 ± 5.3 kg/m2, HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8%, and eGFR 74 ± 21 ml/min/1.73 m2. The study is expected to report in 2015.

Discussion

EMPA-REG OUTCOME™ will determine the CV safety of empagliflozin in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, with the potential to show cardioprotection.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^117Fhau8]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The significance of GLUTs in glucose uptake into patient tumors remains unknown despite our comparison of 2-[18 F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) and Me4FDG uptakes in high grade astrocytomas. The reason being that the accumulation of 2FDG depends on GLUT expression AND intracellular phosphorylation, while non-metabolized Me4FDG accumulation only depends on SGLT2 activity. Our only clue is that SGLT2 plays a more important role than GLUTs in maintaining viable tumor cells is that an SGLT2i reduces tumor growth and increases necrosis in a mouse pancreatic xenograph model.

Questions must be raised about how Me4FDG and Jardiance gain access to tumors in patients, Namely, SGLT2 is not expressed in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) as documented by the fact that Me4FDG does not enter the brain from blood in rodents and man and Figs. 1 and 3, and 4), and that SGLT2 protein is not detected in the BBB. Osmotic opening of the BBB permits Me4FDG to enter the rodent brain. MRI studies with gadolinium contrast agents typically show contrast enhancing of high-grade tumors, e.g. Figs. 1 and 3, indicating vascular leakage across the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Contrast enhancement is not normally observed for low-grade tumors but is apparent in the one case studied (Fig. 4A). It is speculated that gadolinium (MW 567) leaks through the tight junctions of the endothelium of the BTB. Similar access to the extracellular compartment of tumors across the BTB may occur for Me4FDG (MW 196) and Jardiance (MW 451). It is possible that Me4FDG could be transported into tumor extracellular spaces by SGLT2 expressed in the endothelium of the proliferating microvascular of high-grade tumors, but this alone would not account for accumulation of Me4FDG within tumors cells (SUVR > 1).

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the endocrinologist's point of view [^11138oeS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For many years, it was widely accepted that control of plasma lipids and blood pressure could lower macrovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas the benefits of lowering plasma glucose were largely limited to improvements in microvascular complications. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits. In this review, the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are summarized and put into perspective for the endocrinologist who is treating patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^116fRnrN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aims

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial aimed to randomize ∼6000 people with pre-existing CKD to empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus matching placebo in order to assess empagliflozin's effect on time to the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). Kidney disease progression is defined as ESKD, renal death, a sustained decline in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization. Key secondary aims are to assess the effect of empagliflozin on time to hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, occurrences of hospitalizations from any cause and time to death from any cause. Other assessments include analyses of safety and biochemical effects.

FIGURE 1:
EMPA-KIDNEY key outcomes.

EMPA-KIDNEY's design is streamlined, with work for collaborating sites kept to a minimum and only essential information collected. The trial focusses on readily identifiable and important clinical outcomes and data collection relies mainly on participant-reported information recorded at interviews directly into a bespoke web-based system and centrally measured serum creatinine.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 2,721 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE were 65 years of age and older, and 491 (6%) were 75 years of age and older. JARDIANCE is expected to have diminished glycemic efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The risk of volume depletion-related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2.1%, 2.3%, and 4.4% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg. The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10.5%, 15.7%, and 15.1% in patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, no overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. EMPEROR-Reduced included 1,188 (64%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 503 (27%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPEROR-Preserved included 2,402 (80%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,281 (43%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPA-KIDNEY included 2,089 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,518 (23%) patients 75 years of age and older.

### Empagliflozin and the prevention of heart Failure: will reverse translation lead to new paradigms for the treatment of heart failure? [^113n4adK]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Although the study by Byrne et al.did not identify the mechanism(s) for the effect(s) of empagliflozin, the observation that treatment with empagliflozin exerted effects on LV function both in vivo and ex vivo argues against many of the suggested peripheral mechanisms of action of empagliflozin in preventing heart failure, including enhanced natriuresis, renoprotective effects, and decreased vascular stiffness. Although empagliflozin-mediated alterations in cardiac metabolism cannot be formally excluded, the studies by Byrne et al.were conducted in nondiabetic animals, which suggests that prevention of glucotoxicity by SGLT2 inhibition is not a potential mechanism. Moreover, given that the ex vivo studies were performed in the absence of exogenous ketone substrates, the observed effects were likely not due to altered ketone metabolism, one of the metabolic mechanisms proposed for SGLT2i by empagliflozin; however, this study does not formally exclude a potential role for empagliflozin-mediated alterations in endogenous ketone metabolism. Although SGLT2 expression is relatively low in the heart, one cannot exclude the possibility that the cardiac autonomous effects noted in this study could be due to a direct effect of glucose transport or related transport mechanisms. In this regard, it is interesting to note that empagliflozin has been shown to directly inhibit the Na + /H + exchanger (NHE) in isolated cardiac myocytes. From a theoretical perspective, blocking excessive NHE activity would prevent increased intracellular Na + and a resultant decrease in Ca +2 overload through the Na + /Ca ++ exchanger and/or decreased generation of reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, there were no studies of action potential duration, which would have addressed this possibility.

### Safety, tolerability and effects on cardiometabolic risk factors of empagliflozin monotherapy in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind extension of a phase III randomized controlled trial [^117LfDK5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

Recently published results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® trial have shown that in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk (i.e. established cardiovascular disease), empagliflozin added to standard of care reduced the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (3-point major adverse cardiovascular events); cardiovascular death; hospitalisation for heart failure; and overall mortality compared to placebo. Although the mechanisms behind the observed effects of empagliflozin in this patient population are not yet understood, they may involve reductions in hyperglycaemia, blood pressure and weight as well as effects on plasma volume and sodium retention; and reductions in arterial stiffness.

Both doses of empagliflozin and sitagliptin were well tolerated. In accordance with its insulin-independent mode of action, and the results of previous studies, empagliflozin monotherapy was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. In line with previous trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, events consistent with genital infection were reported in a greater proportion of patients treated with empagliflozin than with placebo, and were more common in female than male patients. Consistent with previous studies of empagliflozin, there was no higher risk of UTI in patients treated with empagliflozin in this study.

Strengths of the design of this study include the long duration, that treatment remained double-blind throughout the extension period and the inclusion of a sitagliptin group as an active comparator. Limitations of this study include that all endpoints, while pre-specified, were exploratory, with no primary endpoint defined for the extension study, and the amount of missing data. Only 68% of patients randomized in the initial 24-week study entered the extension period; however, this is within the range for extension studies of other SGLT2 inhibitors. Data obtained after initiation of rescue therapy (5.8–32.5% across treatment groups) were set to missing and imputed. Overall, 51.4% of HbA1c data at week 76 were imputed using a LOCF approach. The methods for handling missing data were analyzed by means of sensitivity analyses, which revealed consistent results regarding improvements in glycaemic control and weight loss with empagliflozin. A further limitation of this study was that the results may not be generalizable to all patients with T2DM, as for example, approximately two-thirds of the patients in the trial were Asian.

### Cardiovascular protection by sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: potential mechanisms [^116kMABj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The mechanism of action of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes vs placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a high risk of cardiovascular disease in the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial is currently unknown. An antiatherosclerotic effect is considered unlikely given the speed of the observed decrease in cardiovascular mortality. Hemodynamic effects, such as reductions in blood pressure and intravascular volume, and involving osmotic diuresis, may provide a more plausible explanation. Metabolic effects, such as cardiac fuel energetics, and hormonal effects, such as increased glucagon release, may also contribute to the results observed during EMPA-REG OUTCOME. This review discusses the main hypotheses suggested to date.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin (daily dosage 10 mg or 25 mg) and metformin HCl (mean daily dosage of approximately 1,800 mg) has been evaluated in 3,456 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 16 to 24 weeks, of which 926 patients received placebo, 1,271 patients received a daily dosage of empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1,259 patients received a daily dosage of empagliflozin 25 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events across treatment groups was 3.0%, 2.8%, and 2.9% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

Adverse Reactions in a Clinical Trial with Empagliflozin (Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl and Sulfonylurea) for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin HCl and sulfonylurea, adverse reactions reported in ≥ 5% of empagliflozin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients are presented in Table 1 (see also Table 4).

Empagliflozin: Coadministration with Other Drugs and Cardiac Safety

Patients with T2DM vary widely in age and often have significant comorbidities, including advanced cardiovascular disease; therefore, this patient population often is receiving several medications concurrently in addition to other anti-diabetes drugs. Accordingly, any potential adverse interactions between empagliflozin and other commonly prescribed drugs are of clinical interest.

Coadministration with a number of clinically important drugs that could reasonably be expected to be prescribed in the T2DM patient population has been tested in a series of open-label, crossover studies in healthy volunteers. These studies showed that empagliflozin can be given together with the anti-diabetes drugs metformin or sitagliptin, the commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs verapamil, ramipril, and digoxin, and the anticoagulant warfarin; in each case without the need for dose adjustment for either empagliflozin or the coadministered drug. In a similar open-label study, researchers demonstrated a combined oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol 30 μg/levonorgestrel 150 μg once daily can be coadministered with oral empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, without requirement for dose adjustment.

A number of drugs are known to prolong the cardiac QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias in treated patients. To assess the cardiac safety of empagliflozin, 30 volunteers with a mean age of 35 years were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single doses of empagliflozin, 25 and 200 mg (therapeutic and supratherapeutic, respectively), versus placebo and open-label moxifloxacin 400 mg as positive control. Within the initial 1–4 h after empagliflozin dosing, the placebo-corrected mean change from baseline in the population heart rate corrected QT interval was 0.6 ms [90% confidence interval (CI) −0.7, 1.9] for empagliflozin 25 mg and −0.2 ms (90% CI −1.4, 0.9) for empagliflozin 200 mg. These values are deemed acceptable since the upper limit of the confidence intervals are < 10 ms, which is the International Conference on Harmonization E14 threshold for regulatory concern. Consistent with the results seen in other trials, the tolerability of empagliflozin was good for all study participants, with 23.3% of the empagliflozin group experiencing AEs with empagliflozin compared with 27.6% of the placebo group.

### Update on perioperative medication management for the hand surgeon: a focus on diabetes, weight loss, rheumatologic, and antithrombotic medications [^116gybcw]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus and obesity are growing health concerns. New pharmacologic interventions have recently begun to play a more notable role in the treatment pathway of these separate but related conditions. In particular, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutides (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro), and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance), have emerged as treatment options. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in regulating metabolism, improving glycemic control, and managing long-term weight reduction. However, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have also been associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including delayed gastric emptying as well as regurgitation and aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation, and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors have been associated with severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, discontinuation of these medications before surgery is imperative. Given the popularity of these medications among the general public, it is essential for hand surgeons, to understand how to appropriately manage them perioperatively. The objective of this article was to review these new diabetes mellitus and weight loss medications, including their mechanisms of action, indications for use, and perioperative management guidelines. Additionally, we will take this opportunity to review perioperative guidelines for other common medications relevant to patients undergoing procedures involving the hand and upper extremity such as antithrombotic medications and rheumatoid arthritis-related immunosuppressive medications. Finally, we will describe how the electronic medical record system can be used to optimize perioperative medication management in this population.

EMPA-REG Outcome trial and LEADER trial

Results of the two latest CVOTs, namely the EMPA-REG Outcome trial and the Liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome results (LEADER) trial have recently stirred much enthusiasm. In these trials, as in SAVOR, TECOS and ELIXA, diabetic patients at very high CVD risk, were enrolled to determine the CVD safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the GLP-1RA liraglutide.

In the EMPA-REG Outcome trial, the primary outcome was a composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (3-point MACE). Two daily doses of the drug were tested: 10 and 25 mg. As compared to placebo, empagliflozin (pooled analyses of 10 and 25 mg) showed non-inferiority for 3-point MACE, non-inferiority for 4-point MACE (including hospitalization for unstable angina), superiority for 3-point MACE and not for 4-point MACE. With respect to secondary endpoints, patients randomized to empagliflozin had significantly reduced risk of hospitalization for HF by 35%, reduced risk CV death by 38%, and reduced risk for all-cause mortality by 32%. The mechanisms responsible for these results are still unclear, being possibly related to pleiotropic effects on risk factors, to hemodynamic effects, and possible direct effects on the heart and vasculature. Furthermore, empagliflozin, compared to placebo, significantly slowed progression of kidney disease and loss of glomerular filtration over time in high-risk patients of the EMPA-REG Outcome trial.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114AQCyy]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the wait for definitive results ended when the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study reported a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), CV death, and death from any cause with the relatively new drug empagliflozin versus placebo. Both were added to standard of care in patients with T2DM at high risk for CV events. Given the history of negative or neutral results in CV outcome trials over the preceding years, EMPA-REG OUTCOME generated considerable excitement in the T2DM community. This was the first dedicated trial to show CV benefit of a glucose-lowering therapy in T2DM; subsequently, trials have reported CV benefit with liraglutide and semaglutide. A further trial has demonstrated reduced risk of stroke or MI with the T2DM drug pioglitazone in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and insulin resistance but without T2DM.

Following the initial presentation of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, specialists around the world have been considering the results and how they might impact treatment decisions in clinical practice. Further analysis showed empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, and this benefit was consistent in patients with and without baseline heart failure. Empagliflozin was also associated with improvements in renal outcomes, including a 39% reduction in new onset or worsening of nephropathy (HR 0.61; P < 0.001). There has been some speculation on whether the benefit seen with empagliflozin may have resulted, at least in part, from factors other than improvements in blood glucose control, such as a hemodynamic or volume effect. This review considers the clinical trial evidence and mechanism of action of empagliflozin, before taking a closer look at the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study and how the results may influence treatment decisions, particularly in primary care practice.

Four large phase 3 clinical studies have also previously investigated inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in HFpEF/HFmrEF. No definitive benefit was observed in clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of candesartan, perindopril, or irbesartan (CHARM-Preserved [Candesartan Cilexetil in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity], PEP-CHF [Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart Failure], and I-PRESERVE [Irbesartan in Heart Failure With Preserved Systolic Function] studies, respectively). The TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function HF with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial saw a reduction in its composite primary endpoint associated with spironolactone treatment in the subpopulation enrolled in the Americas only.

To date, only sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for treating HFpEF/HFmrEF. Given these recent approvals, the long-term clinical trajectory of patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF can be modeled using recent clinical trial data. The objective of this study was to simulate major clinical outcomes and medical costs in patients with symptomatic HFpEF/HFmrEF treated with usual care over a 10-year time horizon.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^114FpHEp]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis of Me4FDG uptake into the tumor is expressed by the ratio of the tumor ROI to the torcula ROI (SUVR) and the signal (S) to noise (N) ratio for the tumor relative to the background (BG) for white and grey matter. Tumor voxels with at least 90% of the maximum value within the tumor ROI were used to calculate the peak uptake (SUVR peak). Values are given as the mean with the standard error of the mean, and N the number of estimates. The significance of differences between means before and after treatment with Jardiance were evaluated by unpaired t-tests to obtain p -values (Table S2).

Fusion of MRI and PET scans were performed using previously described techniques. First, DICOM images were converted to the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIFTI) standardized format using dcm2niix. Next, all PET images were linearly registered (6 degrees of freedom) to pre-treatment, post-contrast T1-weighted MRI scans, using FLIRT, the image registration tool from FSL (FMRIB Software Library;), an open-source and freely available library of analysis tools for brain.

Following evaluation of the first PET scan, the second Me4FDG PET scan was conducted within ten days after a single oral dose of Jardiance, 25 or 100 mg: 25 mg /day is the FDA approved dose for treatment of T2DM, and 100 mg produces the maximum 24-hour renal glucose excretion in control subjects. Jardiance R (empagliflozin 25 mg tablets, Boehringer Ingelheim / Lilly) obtained from the Pharmacy at the UCLA Medical Center. Tablets were ingested by subjects 2–4 h prior to the Me4FDG PET scan (Table S1). The iso-contour method was used to align tumor uptakes before and after treatment with Jardiance. No adverse side effects of the single oral dose of Jardiance or the two PET scans were encountered.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^1128WzLB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY's primary outcome incorporates a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from the randomization value in the trial definition of kidney disease progression, compared with the larger ≥ 50% decline in eGFR pre-specified by DAPA-CKD and doubling of creatinine (effectively a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR) utilized in CREDENCE. EMPA-KIDNEY employed such a definition as it aimed to recruit a large proportion of people with low levels of albuminuria and without DM who are predicted to progress more slowly than people with albuminuric diabetic CKD. Smaller percentage declines in eGFR ensure such people contribute to the primary outcome. However, when testing interventions, which can cause an acute initial decline in eGFR (such as SGLT-2 inhibitors), smaller percentage declines in eGFR may be a less specific surrogate of progression to ESKD than large percentage declines. The EMPA-KIDNEY DAP has therefore pre-specified exploratory analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on a composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death using alternative eGFR thresholds, thereby allowing some harmonization across the three trials.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple rising doses of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117Ewzci]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This first trial investigating the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with T2DM demonstrated that multiple oral doses of empagliflozin (2.5–100 mg) increased UGE, reduced plasma glucose and were well tolerated in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful blood glucose lowering effects that were apparent on the first day of treatment, were enhanced over the course of this (short-term) trial and lasted beyond 24 h after intake of the last dose. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of empagliflozin were consistent with once-daily dosing. These results warrant further long-term investigation of this compound as a potential treatment for T2DM.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

JARDIANCE has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adults with heart failure, and in adults with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of JARDIANCE was generally consistent across the studied indications.

### Empagliflozin and the prevention of heart Failure: will reverse translation lead to new paradigms for the treatment of heart failure? [^1151AkcQ]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

The study by Byrne et al.represents an exciting example of "reverse translation (bedside to bench)", whereby the unexpected results of a clinical trial serve as the stimulus to explore novel actions of a drug that had striking effects on clinically meaningful cardiovascular outcomes. However, what is most intriguing about the reverse translation in this instance is that it suggests there is an unknown mechanism of action for a "diabetic drug" that is operative even in the absence of diabetes, at least in the experimental model used. Although the current study falls short of providing a satisfactory mechanism of action for the observed findings, it does provide the scientific basis for ongoing clinical trials in patients with established heart failure where diabetes is not the primary inclusion criterion (i.e. EMPEROR-Reduced [Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction] EMPEROR-Preserved [EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction] and Dapa-HF [Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Worsening Heart Failure or Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure]). As with all studies, and particularly for those studies that lack a coherent biological explanation, it will be important in the future to replicate these findings in different animal models, as well as elucidate the mechanism(s) of action. It will also be important to determine whether the effects are dependent on cardiac myocyte SGLT2, using targeted loss-of-function studies. Nonetheless, the unique pharmacological profile of SGLT2 inhibitors places them at the intersection of metabolic, hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and vascular endothelial pathways that impact the heart and the kidney, all of which are important in the treatment of heart failure, particularly heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, for which there are no currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies. The exciting study by Byrne et al.suggests that we still have a lot to learn about how SGLT2 inhibitors work in the heart.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^114tRMz8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulating sympathetic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations. The steady-state mean plasma AUC and Cmaxwere 1,870 nmol∙h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4,740 nmol∙h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range. Empagliflozin does not appear to have time-dependent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Following once-daily dosing, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state.

### ▼ empagliflozin, diabetes and outcomes [^115GdJnf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising, and in 2015 more than 5% of adults in the UK were affected by this condition.(1,2) Management of type 2 diabetes includes encouraging lifestyle changes (increased exercise, modification of diet and smoking cessation) alongside the provision of medication to minimise long-term complications and manage blood sugar control while avoiding unwanted effects of drug treatment.(3) Of particular importance, people with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and therefore the aims of treatment also include modification of associated risk factors.(2–5)▼ Empagliflozin (Jardiance-Boehringer Ingelheim) is the third sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor licensed for use in the UK. It was launched in August 2014, and acts in a similar way to the other SGLT2 inhibitors, ▼ dapagliflozin and ▼ canagliflozin, by inhibiting renal glucose resorption and promoting glycosuria.(6) It is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults to improve glycaemic control, as monotherapy when metformin cannot be used, and in combination with other glucose-lowering drugs including insulin. Here we review the evidence for empagliflozin and discuss the results of a recent study that assessed cardiovascular outcomes.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^1148Vxyp]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study we have set out to determine the functional activity of SGLT2 in astrocytomas in patients. Our approach was to use PET to measure Me4FDG uptake into these tumors before and after treatment with a Jardiance®, a high affinity, specific SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). Patients were given a single oral dose of Jardiance 2–4 h before the second PET scan. The efficiency of Jardiance in inhibiting SGLT2 under this protocol was evaluated by measuring the excretion of Me4FDG into the urinary bladder.

While we would have preferred to carry our study on newly diagnosed patients as in our 2018 study, the standard of care does not permit two experimental PET scans before surgery. Instead, we chose to conduct our experiments on four patients with grade IV recurrent tumors after initial surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, and one with a grade II astrocytoma (Table 1). In all five cases Jardiance reduced the uptake of Me4FDG. We conclude that our results suggest a basis for conducting clinical trials to determine whether Jardiance and other SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the growth of these devastating tumors.

### Empagliflozin and the prevention of heart Failure: will reverse translation lead to new paradigms for the treatment of heart failure? [^1148BY3U]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure develops in more than 1 in 5 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) older than 65 years of age and augers an extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately 4 years. The landmark EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) showed that empagliflozin significantly reduced the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.74 to 0.99; p = 0.04 for superiority) in patients with type 2 DM and established cardiovascular (CV) disease. Remarkably, empagliflozin reduced death from CV causes by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with type 2 DM and established CV disease. Notably, the improvements in primary outcomes in the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial occurred within the first 2 to 3 months of the trial. These striking results have raised a number of questions about the potential mechanism of action whereby empagliflozin, a renal sodium glucose transport (SGLT) inhibitor, reduces heart failure endpoints. A number of mechanisms, both cardiac and extracardiac, have been proposed including enhanced diuretic efficiency, renal protective effects, enhanced cardiac substrate metabolism, and decreased vascular stiffness. However, the specific mechanism responsible for the striking effects of empagliflozin on CV outcomes is not known. Accordingly, the paper by Byrne et al.in this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science is of considerable interest, insofar as it suggests that empagliflozin may target the heart by a novel direct cardiac mechanism.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bench to bedside review [^113BLUip]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Additional Phase II and Phase III trials are underway and have been designed to test the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin over longer follow-up and in larger numbers of patients, representing a broad range of clinical subtypes (severity, duration, age, ethnicity, etc.). These ongoing trials will provide key data on the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, often in combination with other anti-diabetes treatments, including cardiovascular outcomes data in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, patients and their healthcare providers will be in an informed position to leverage the potential of these drugs, in the context of a growing movement toward more individualized approaches to diabetes care.

### Slope of change in hbAfrom baseline with empagliflozin compared with sitagliptin or glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113KYxfp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The observation of greater reductions in HbA 1c with increasing baseline HbA 1c is consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, which act by reducing the renal threshold for glucose spillage into the urine to values less than the normal fasting plasma glucose concentration. 9 SGLT2 inhibitors target glucose that would otherwise be reabsorbed by the kidney. Thus, it is expected that the higher the glucose concentration up till the (untreated) renal threshold for glucose, the greater the incremental excretion of glucose into the urine with SGLT2 inhibition, and, ultimately, the greater the expected decline in HbA 1c. It should be noted that the reduction in HbA 1c observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is approximately 50% of that expected based on urinary glucose excretion, likely because of an increase in endogenous glucose production 17 and increased glucose reabsorption by SGLT1, which is capable of reabsorbing up to 30%‐40% of the filtered glucose load. 7 If the increase in endogenous glucose production were to be prevented or if glucose reabsorption by SGLT1 were blocked, the decline in HbA 1c for any given starting HbA 1c would potentially be even greater with empagliflozin compared to sitagliptin or glimepiride. Further, the slope of HbA 1c reduction in other commonly used antidiabetes agents will be influenced by their mechanism of action, that is, increased insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, inhibition of endogenous glucose production or insulin sensitization, which impose physiological limits to their efficacy. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the renal threshold for glucose to well below the fasting plasma glucose concentration observed in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. 9 This may contribute to a disproportionately greater HbA 1c reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors than with other antidiabetes agents with increasing plasma glucose levels as long as GFR is not significantly reduced. Glycosuria with empagliflozin decreases with decreasing estimated GFR, 18 and in patients with type 2 diabetes who have a reduced GFR, the glucose‐lowering effect of empagliflozin is reduced. 19

These are some limitations to the present analyses. First, these were post‐hoc analyses. Second, these exploratory analyses did not include the placebo arm of Study 1; this is different from the approach of the primary analysis of the study that included placebo as the main comparator.

In conclusion, reductions in HbA 1c with increasing baseline HbA 1c are greater with empagliflozin compared with sitagliptin or glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Results

In EMPA-KIDNEY, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization; information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.54, 0.78)], and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy [HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48, 1.09)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Empagliflozin

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

SYNJARDY

Administration of 12.5 mg empagliflozin/1,000 mg metformin HCl under fed conditions resulted in a 9% decrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmaxfor empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions. For metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmaxdecreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically relevant.

SYNJARDY XR

Administration of SYNJARDY XR with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of empagliflozin. For metformin HCl extended-release high-fat meals increased systemic exposure to metformin (as measured by area-under-the-curve [AUC]) by approximately 70% relative to fasting, while Cmaxis not affected. Meals prolonged Tmaxby approximately 3 hours.

SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and cardiovascular outcomes

In response to concerns about the increased cardiovascular risk associated with some treatments for diabetes, regulators in the USA and Europe mandated cardiovascular safety trials of all new hypoglycaemic drugs in 2008. In recent cardiovascular outcome trials, the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular events, reversing the trend of previous therapies. While the benefits with GLP-1RAs are associated with reduced atherothrombotic events like myocardial infarction and stroke, SGLT2-inhibitor therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes in heart failure(table 2). Interestingly, the reduction in heart failure hospitalisation was observed within months of randomisation, suggesting a different mechanism of effect from those of other glucose-lowering drugs which usually takes years to manifest. The consistent signal of improved heart failure outcomes in the early trials led to the 'Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction' (DAPA-HF trial) which was specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of the SGLT2-inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. This trial showed that dapagliflozin reduces the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes by 26%, regardless of diabetes status, suggesting that these benefits are independent of the drug's glucose-lowering effect'. More recently, results from the 'Empagliflozin outcome trial in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction' (EMPEROR-Reduced) trial showed that empagliflozin also reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalisation in patients with known heart failure with reduced ejection fraction regardless of diabetes status. In both of these trials, the risk reduction seen in their primary outcomes was principally driven by a reduction in hospitalisations for heart failure. Meta-analysis of these two trials shows consistency of effect of both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin with reductions in all the individual endpoints of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure or decline in renal function. Thus, these striking benefits appear to be a class effect of SGLT2-inhibitor therapies. So, what is the mechanism of these marked benefits?

Table 2
Summary of large clinical trials of the SGLT2-inhibitor class

Conventional potential mechanisms of benefit with SGLT2 inhibition

The desirable cardiovascular effects seen with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment may be multifactorial, but key pathways involved are currently being explored. Some of the conventional theories are discussed in the following section.

### Rationale and design of a multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function: the EMBLEM trial [^112jJjDD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, with the recent accumulation of evidence suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors have CV and renal protective effects beyond glucose-lowering, the clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and established CVD could gain increased momentum.

Therefore, further assessments of the mechanisms that underpin the functionality of SGLT2 inhibitors are certainly warranted. The EMBLEM trial is the first study to assess the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function in patients with T2DM and established CVD. In addition, possible mechanisms driving empagliflozin-mediated interactions between endothelial function and other CV markers will be evaluated. This trial has the potential to reveal profound mechanisms of action by which empagliflozin protects the CV system and improves CV outcomes in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

### Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^113jHWkA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR

SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR contain: empagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a biguanide.

Empagliflozin

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulating sympathetic activity.

Metformin HCl

Metformin HCl is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin HCl decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin HCl does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or normal subjects (except in special circumstances) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin HCl therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

The effect of JARDIANCE on cardiovascular (CV) risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established, stable, atherosclerotic CV disease was evaluated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial. The trial compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between JARDIANCE and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic CV disease. Concomitant antidiabetic medications were to be kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial. Thereafter, antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

A total of 7,020 patients were treated (JARDIANCE 10 mg = 2,345; JARDIANCE 25 mg = 2,342; placebo = 2,333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. Approximately 72% of the trial population was White, 22% was Asian, and 5% was Black. The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72% were male.

All patients in the trial had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and 57% of participants had diabetes mellitus for more than 10 years. Approximately 31%, 22% and 20% reported a past history of neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators, respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were treated with one (~30%) or more (~70%) antidiabetic medications including metformin (74%), insulin (48%), and sulfonylurea (43%).

These results were exciting, but even more intriguing were individual components of the primary outcome: the biggest reduction was seen in CV mortality. As shown in Fig. 2 b, CV mortality occurred in 3.7% of the pooled empagliflozin group versus 5.9% of the placebo group (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49–0.77; P < 0.001). The reduction in risk was seen early in the trial, suggesting a mechanism other than atherosclerosis, since a longer time would be expected before a reduction would be observed. Fatal or non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI) was not significantly reduced, occurring in 4.8% of the pooled empagliflozin group and 5.4% of the placebo group (HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70–1.09; P = 0.23), again suggesting that the reduction in the primary endpoint was not driven by atherosclerosis. Stroke (fatal or non-fatal) occurred in 3.5% of patients in the empagliflozin combined groups and 3.0% of patients in the placebo group (HR 1.18; 95% CI: 0.89–1.56; P = 0.26). When looking at only non-fatal stroke, the confidence intervals again crossed 1 (HR 1.24; 95% CI: 0.92–1.67; P = 0.16). What is not yet clear is whether these strokes occurred more frequently in patients with a history of stroke(s) at entry, which would put them at higher risk for subsequent stroke. If so, this could represent a return to their pre-intervention level of risk for subsequent stroke. The authors did look separately at these patients: of the study population, about 23% (n = 1084) had a history of stroke at baseline, and because patients could have coronary disease as well as stroke, 960 patients had a history of only cerebrovascular disease. Subgroup analysis showed no heterogeneity for the primary outcome or for the risk of death from CV causes, but subgroup analysis looking specifically at the outcomes of stroke or transient ischemic attack was not published. Any such analyses would of course be post hoc and could only be considered exploratory but would be welcome, especially in light of the effect of empagliflozin on volume events. Recent analysis of glomerular filtration in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study showed that values increased after the end of the treatment period; although this in itself is considered a good thing, it may reflect underlying changes that could affect the risk of stroke.

Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 to 17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

JARDIANCE was administered to 52 patients in a trial of 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a mean exposure to JARDIANCE of 23.8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.1 years. The mean age was 14.5 years (range: 10–17 years) and 51.6% were aged 15 years and older. Approximately, 50% were White, 6% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 36.0 kg/m2and mean BMI Z-score was 3.0. Approximately 25% of the trial population had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.

The risk of hypoglycemia was higher in pediatric patients treated with JARDIANCE regardless of concomitant insulin use. Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose < 54 mg/dL, occurred in 10 (19.2%) patients and in 4 (7.5%) patients treated with JARDIANCE and placebo, respectively. No severe hypoglycemic events occurred (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon or take other corrective actions).

Clinical Trials in Adults with Heart Failure

No new adverse reactions were identified in EMPEROR-Reduced or EMPEROR-Preserved heart failure trials.

Clinical Trial in Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease

The safety profile in patients with chronic kidney disease was generally consistent with that observed across the studied indications. In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial [see Clinical Studies 14.5], in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and JARDIANCE 10 mg treatment arms, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the composite kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease by 46% versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. Studies have also suggested that empagliflozin reduces the risk of adverse kidney outcomes across a wide range of kidney disease stages in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also in those with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence of T2D. More recently, the CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with CKD. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included a substantial proportion of patients without T2D and reported consistent benefits regardless of presence of diabetes. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of these highly impactful effects remain incompletely understood.

### Heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitors and heart failure – clinical implications [^114FSDWG]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

The latest findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial show a 34% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients receiving empagliflozin, a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with placebo. These outstanding results call for discussion of the clinical implications, and in-depth studies of the mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors.

This increased efficacy at higher baseline HbA1c values is also interesting in terms of the open-label arm of this study. Patients who were otherwise eligible but with screening HbA1c > 10.0% were not randomized but instead were all assigned open-label empagliflozin 25 mg. At baseline, mean HbA1c in this group was 11.5%, and by week 24 it had fallen to 7.6%. This mean level is still above the recommended target for most patients, yet 28% of this group reached a goal of HbA1c < 7.0%. Although an open-label study such as this must be interpreted with caution, it suggests that empagliflozin may provide useful glycemic improvements across a range of baseline HbA1c values.

Further phase 3 placebo-controlled trials have shown significant reductions in HbA1c when empagliflozin was used as add-on to metformin, pioglitazone with or without metformin, and sulfonylureas plus metformin. Reductions were of a similar amount to those seen with monotherapy and to those expected for other SGLT2 inhibitors. Empagliflozin has also been studied in twice-daily combinations with metformin (immediate-release) in treatment-naïve patients and fixed-dose combinations with linagliptin in treatment-naïve patients or patients already on stable metformin. Two studies recruited patients on insulin (either basal insulin or multiple daily injections) and both showed significant reductions even in these typically refractory patients. This demonstrates one of the key features of the mechanism of action — that empagliflozin can be used across the diabetes spectrum since it does not depend on endogenous insulin. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that many patients with advanced T2DM, and thus likely to be on insulin, will also have some degree of renal impairment, and this can impact the HbA1c reduction. Because of its mechanism of action, empagliflozin relies on adequate renal function to be effective and is contraindicated in people with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or dialysis. However, empagliflozin has been studied in patients with renal impairment over the range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15–90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in a 52-week study with the primary endpoint being change in HbA1c after 24 weeks. In patients with eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 [stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD)], empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were both associated with significant reductions in HbA1c versus placebo (−0.52% for empagliflozin 10 mg and −0.68% for empagliflozin 25 mg; both P < 0.0001). Patients with eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 3 CKD) were only randomized to placebo or the higher dose of empagliflozin (25 mg), and again empagliflozin gave a significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo, although this appeared more modest than in patients with mild renal impairment (mean −0.42%; P < 0.0001). The study included a relatively small number of patients (n = 74) with stage 4 CKD (≥ 15 to < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and in this group empagliflozin was not associated with significant reductions in HbA1c; in fact, the mean change was a small increase of 0.04%, although the investigators noted reductions in BP and body weight. Overall, this suggests that empagliflozin may be useful in patients with T2DM and mild or moderate renal impairment, especially since there are relatively few options in this group.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114yi7sf]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Empagliflozin is an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Recently, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study has shown that empagliflozin added to standard of care treatment reduced the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with T2DM who were also at increased CV risk. The risk of major adverse CV events (MACE: first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) was reduced by 14% relative to placebo (HR 0.86; 95.02% CI: 0.74–0.99; P = 0.04 for superiority). The risk of CV death was reduced by 38% relative to the placebo group (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49–0.77; P < 0.001) and the risk of death from any cause by 32% (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.82; P < 0.001). Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure and of renal adverse events. As well as EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin has been studied in a number of clinical trials in patients with T2DM, in various combinations, including with insulin. Empagliflozin has shown significant improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure, albeit improvements are limited in patients with declining renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Empagliflozin has been generally well tolerated, with the typical adverse events of genital mycotic infections usually being straightforward to manage. Considering all the data together, empagliflozin appears to be a promising option for many patients with T2DM, but care will still be needed to ensure that use is appropriate for an individual patient's characteristics.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bench to bedside review [^113SxbyX]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

A second Phase II study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on therapy to metformin. The investigators randomized 495 patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled on metformin (HbA1c > 7% to ≤ 10%) to double-blind empagliflozin (1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg once daily) or placebo, or to open-label sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, in addition to metformin for 12 weeks. At baseline (while on stable metformin), mean HbA1c across the seven groups ranged from 7.8 to 8.1%. After 12 weeks, mean HbA1c increased by 0.15% in the placebo group, compared with reductions of −0.1%, −0.2%, −0.6%, −0.6%, and −0.5% with empagliflozin 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg, respectively, once daily (all were significant with the exception of 1 mg empagliflozin). In addition, empagliflozin doses of 5–50 mg significantly reduced FPG levels at 12 weeks, with mean reductions of −2 to −28 mg/dL compared with an increase of 5 mg/dL with placebo (all p < 0.0001). Empagliflozin was also associated with body weight reductions after 12 weeks (−2.3 to −2.9 kg with empagliflozin 5–50 mg vs. −1.2 kg with placebo; p < 0.01).

In this study, empagliflozin was generally well tolerated, and reported frequencies of AEs were similar in the three main treatment groups: empagliflozin (29.6–48.6%), placebo (36.6%), and sitagliptin (35.2%), and the reported rates of hypoglycemia were low and balanced among the groups. The most frequent AEs were UTIs (4.0% vs. 2.8%; empagliflozin vs. placebo) and pollakiuria (2.5% vs. 1.4%; empagliflozin vs. placebo). Genital infections (4.0%) were reported only in the empagliflozin-treated patients.

In these Phase II studies, empagliflozin treatment led to dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, along with concomitant reductions in body weight compared with placebo-treated patients after 12 weeks, indicating empagliflozin can be efficacious as monotherapy or as add-on therapy for patients with T2DM who are not meeting their treatment goals on metformin alone.

Patients and methods

Study design and patients

This retrospective study includes 200 patients who followed a treatment with SGLT-2i, Dapagliflozin 10 mg (Forxiga (Dapagliflozin) 10 mg) /Qtern (Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin 5/10 mg)), or Empagliflozin 10 mg (Jardiance 10 mg) for at least one year. The patients were chosen from the "Pius Brânzeu" Timisoara County Emergency Hospital based on the inclusion criteria, namely patients diagnosed with T2DM with SGLT-2i included in the treatment regimen.

The study was conducted following the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Ethics Committee of the "Pius Brinzeu" Emergency Hospital Timisoara approved the protocol. All the patients who participated in the study consented after being fully informed about the study's details.

The inclusion criteria in the study were:

patients with T2DM in treatment with different types of SGLT-2i and/or other DM medication.

The exclusion criteria from the study were:

patients with T1DM;
pregnant or lactating T2DM patients;
the presence of a mental illness.

In this study, we tracked demographic data (sex, age, urban or rural origin), data obtained from the objective examination (blood pressure, weight, body mass index), and paraclinical data (fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, rate of glomerular filtration, lipid profile).

The main modifiable risk factors monitored were body weight, blood pressure, glycemic balance (HbA1c, fasting glucose), lipid profile (HDLc, LDLc), and renal function (glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria).

### Long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and metformin: an active-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, 78-week open-label extension study in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114qJ2b9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and progressive deterioration of β-cell function. Metformin is the recommended first-line antidiabetes agent for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, in order to achieve and maintain glycemic control as the disease progresses, patients often require therapies in addition to metformin.

Despite the availability of a number of antihyperglycemic agents, the side effects associated with existing treatments and their gradual loss of efficacy over time mean that many patients with type 2 diabetes do not reach therapeutic goals. In addition, treatment is often complicated by common comorbidities of type 2 diabetes such as obesity and hypertension, which are not addressed by existing oral antidiabetes agents.

Inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the proximal tubule of the kidney, represents an approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is independent of β-cell function and insulin resistance. SGLT2 mediates most of renal glucose reabsorption, and inhibition of this transporter leads to reduced reabsorption of filtered glucose and increased urinary glucose excretion, resulting in reduced plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, this mechanism leads to weight loss owing to the loss of calories via urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of SGLT2, which in patients with type 2 diabetes causes urinary glucose excretion of up to 90 g/day. In two placebo- and active-controlled, dose-finding trials, treatment with empagliflozin for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes was generally well tolerated and resulted in placebo-corrected reductions in HbA 1c of up to 0.72% (7.9 mmol/mol) and placebo-corrected reductions in weight of up to 1.7 kg. In these studies, reductions in HbA 1c were comparable to those of the active comparators metformin and sitagliptin. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and metformin in a 78-week, open-label extension study of two dose-finding trials.

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the cardiologist's point of View [^1164uvjW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiologists could view empagliflozin as a cardiovascular drug that also has a beneficial effect on reducing hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The effects of empagliflozin in lowering the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in T2DM patients with high cardiovascular risk during the recent Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial may be explained principally in terms of changes to cardiovascular physiology; namely, by the potential ability of empagliflozin to reduce cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering blood pressure, improving aortic compliance, and improving ventricular arterial coupling. These concepts and hypotheses are discussed in this report.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^116eLTy2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

At baseline, 81% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNI, 86% with beta-blockers, 38% with MRAs, and 86% with diuretics.

The primary endpoint was the time to first event of either CV death or HHF. First and recurrent HHF was assessed as a key secondary endpoint.

JARDIANCE was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint compared with placebo, mostly through a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. JARDIANCE reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF (see Table 17 and Figures 10 and 11).

### Exploring the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors on genitourinary toxicities in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy: a case study and discussion [^111DeDaA]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality offered to patients with localized prostate cancer. It can be associated with early radiation-induced toxicities including dysuria, nocturia, frequency, urgency, spasm, and, rarely, hematuria. Early toxicities usually resolve once the treatment period has ended. Chronic toxicities are less common, and rarely, patients may experience radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and hematuria months or years after radiation. We herein describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus who experienced hemorrhagic cystitis for months following his radiation therapy. The patient was on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy (empagliflozin), which we highlight as a potential risk factor for hemorrhagic cystitis. After cessation of Jardiance and initiation of semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist), his urinary symptoms significantly improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case reported.

### Empagliflozin increases cardiac energy Production in diabetes: novel translational insights into the heart failure benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors [^116rWfnh]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors are antihyperglycemic agents that have profound and precocious effects on the prevention of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at high cardiovascular risk. In 2 recently completed U.S. Food and Drug Administration–mandated cardiovascular outcome studies, the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin were associated with an ∼35% reduction in the rates of hospitalization for heart failure in participants with either established cardiovascular disease or with cardiovascular risk factors. Importantly, the benefits of empagliflozin and canagliflozin therapy emerged almost immediately, with very rapid separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves for both hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Although various mechanisms have been suggested, including osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, the potential impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac bioenergetics has not been reported.

Alterations in myocardial substrate use and cardiac energy production play a critical role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. To fulfill the exceptional metabolic demands, the myocardium is capable of incredible metabolic flexibility and can use a variety of energy substrates such as fatty acids, glucose, ketone bodies, and amino acids for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Marked and aberrant changes in metabolic flexibility and substrate use play an early and permissive role in the development of heart failure and are believed to promote adverse remodeling and progression to severe heart failure in both experimental and clinical settings.

It has been hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibitors may prevent heart failure through improving ATP generation from ketone body oxidation, thereby enhancing cardiac efficiency (cardiac work/O 2 consumed). However, this hypothesis remains controversial, and to date, no cogent evidence to support this proposed beneficial mechanism has been provided. Because SGLT2 inhibitors are known to increase the production of ketone bodies (such as β-hydroxybutyrate [ßOHB]), it has been suggested that an increase in myocardial ketone body oxidation may serve to improve cardiac ATP production as a preferred substrate to fatty acids or glucose in the diabetic heart. Whereas ketone bodies have been shown to be a source of energy supply in the hypertrophied failing heart, the relationship that exists between ketone bodies, glucose, and fatty acid oxidation in the diabetic heart remains unclear, particularly as it relates to SGLT2 inhibition.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^112SSe6k]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 7 and Figures 4 and 5). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

Figure 4	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of First MACE

Figure 5	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of CV Death

The efficacy of empagliflozin on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with empagliflozin, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^113ifqV2]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^112VNisC]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Me4FDG PET scans and a post-contrast T1w MRI of a 52-year-old male patient (SP11) with a recurrent left parietal lobe WHO grade IV glioblastoma. The PET scans were conducted before and after treatment with an oral 100 mg dose of Jardiance. Both the Me4FDG PET scans and the MRI also show the left parietal mass, 4.9 × 3.3 × 4.1 cm, and a second smaller lesion in the left thalamus. The PET images were taken from the sum of the last three frames between 15 and 30 min (see Fig. 2 A). No malignancies were detected in whole body CT and Me4FDG PET images

The time course of Me4FDG uptakes into the left parietal tumor before and after Jardiance treatment is shown in Fig. 2 A. After an initial transient peak due to the distribution of the injected dose of Me4FDG throughout the vascular tree, Me4FDG accumulated in the tumor to a steady state value in the absence of Jardiance of 0.017 MBq/g with a half-time of ∼ 8 min. Treatment with 100 mg Jardiance significantly reduced the uptake to 0.010 MBq/g with no apparent change in the half-time. Figure 2 B shows the time course of the Input Function, the activity of Me4FDG in the Torcula, the venous blood draining the brain. The initial peak at ∼ 0.5 min is due to the distribution of the tracer in the vascular tree after i.v. injection, and the decay is due to the distribution of Me4FDG from blood into the extracellular and intracellular compartments throughout the body. It is notable that Jardiance treatment did not alter the Input Function or the background (BG) for white and grey matter. Under our protocol Jardiance inhibited renal SGLT2 as recorded by the excretion of Me4FDG into the urinary bladder. On average 0.5% of the injected Me4FDG dose (10 mCi or 370 MBq) was excreted into the bladder in one hour, while after the oral dose of Jardiance 10% was excreted (see Figure legends).

8.6 Renal Impairment

The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of JARDIANCE for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

JARDIANCE was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Efficacy and safety trials with JARDIANCE did not enroll adult patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled, adult patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials were not required to discontinue therapy for worsening of eGFR to less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or initiation of dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Class effect of SGLT-2i

The definition of class effect for a drug may be based on three concepts: a similar chemical structure, a similar mechanism of action and similar pharmacological effects. SGLT-2i are considered a class as they share a similar chemical structure derived from the ancestor phlorizin, a similar mechanism of action related to the inhibition of SGLT-2 located on the luminal membrane of proximal tubular cells (brush border), and similar pharmacological effects at the level of kidney, resulting in glycosuria and osmotic diuresis. In order to make the concept of a class more stringent, we have assumed that a class effect is paramount when an effect on a particular outcome is present and is significant for each drug within the class of SGLT-2i.

Figure 4 shows the effects of the five SGLT-2i (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin and sotagliflozin) tested in outcome trials according to the more stringent definition of class effect, as detailed above. The outcomes considered include MACE (with its three components of nonfatal MI, CV mortality and nonfatal stroke), which was the primary outcome in EMPA-REG, CANVAS, DECLARE, VERTIS-CV and SCORED, hospitalization for HF and progression of DKD, which were secondary outcomes. Because of the early closing of the SCORED trial and the fewer than planned number of events, the primary end point was changed during the trial to the composite of the total number of deaths from CV causes, hospitalizations and urgent visits for HF.

### Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^114vbHmd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 13 and Figures 4 and 5). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

Figure 4	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of First MACE

Figure 5	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of CV Death

The efficacy of empagliflozin on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with empagliflozin, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

EMPEROR-Reduced Trial (Chronic Heart Failure with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≤ 40%)

EMPEROR-Reduced (NCT03057977) was a double-blind trial conducted in adults with chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV] with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% to evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin as adjunct to standard of care heart failure therapy. Of 3,730 patients, 1,863 were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and 1,867 to placebo once daily and were followed for a median of 16 months.

### Empagliflozin and protecting microvascular support of heart Mechanics: SGLT2 inhibition or more? [^113Pcq6P]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately 6.5 million adults in the United States have heart failure (HF), representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality. HF is traditionally divided into 2 subtypes, HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with each accounting for about 50% of HF cases. Although HFpEF and HFrEF can display similar clinical presentations during acute HF exacerbations, they are often associated with different risk factors, pathophysiological processes, and responses to therapy. Many therapies with unequivocal benefit in HFrEF have failed to show efficacy for HFpEF. This is, in part, why the recent findings of EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) have generated tremendous enthusiasm. EMPA-REG OUTCOME was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 7,020 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it demonstrated that the primary endpoint, a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, was significantly reduced (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 0.99) over a median follow-up of 3.1 years. The composite outcome was largely driven by a 38% relative risk reduction of cardiovascular death (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77) and a 32% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.82). Of interest, there was a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85), supporting favorable hemodynamic effects of the drug. Further analysis revealed that the reduction of hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death were observed both in patients with and without HF at baseline. HF was not phenotyped at baseline, but 2 ongoing clinical trials, EMPEROR-Preserved (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) and EMPEROR-Reduced (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), are actively enrolling patients to study the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with each subset of HF.

5.2 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin, a component of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with empagliflozin. SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

### Empagliflozin, metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^113Pajoc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) mostly through a reduction in HHF (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.65, 0.86]). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF, a key secondary endpoint. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with heart failure without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.60, 0.87]), and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.49, 0.86]).

### Mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a state-of-the-art review [^112WhegG]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the most serious health concerns in the world is heart failure, with over 50 million people worldwide being afflicted with this disease. Despite the advances made in the treatment of heart failure, patients diagnosed with heart failure still have a very poor prognosis and quality of life. It also remains the most common reason for hospitalization in older individuals. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are particularly susceptible to developing heart failure, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these individuals. It is therefore critical to develop new therapies and approaches to prevent and treat heart failure.

A number of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been developed to treat hyperglycemia in T2DM, which act by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. A number of large clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes (with established vascular disease, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, or renal insufficiency) and in those with established heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (with and without type 2 diabetes). The remarkable results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcomes Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients — Removing Excess Glucose) demonstrated that T2DM patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease had an early reduction in major cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This included a marked reduction in cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients treated with empagliflozin. Subsequent large trials with other SGLT2 inhibitors, such as canagliflozin (CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study] and CREDENCE [Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy] trials) and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58 [Dapagliflozin and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes] trial, confirmed these observations in a broader population of primary and secondary prevention patients (see Zelniker et al. and Verma et al. for discussions of trials).

### Low-dose empagliflozin as adjunct-to-insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: a valid modelling and simulation analysis to confirm efficacy [^115Fhxg6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To confirm the observed reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5mg dose in EASE-3 by modelling and simulation analyses.

Materials and Methods

Independent of data from EASE-3 that tested 2.5mg, we simulated the effect of a 2.5mg dose through patient-level, exposure-response modelling in the EASE-2 clinical study. A primary semi-mechanistic model evaluated efficacy considering clinical insulin dose adjustments made after treatment initiation that potentially limited HbA1c reductions. The model was informed by pharmacokinetic, insulin dose, mean daily glucose and HbA1c data, and was verified by comparing the simulations with the observed HbA1c change in EASE-3. One of two empagliflozin phase 3 trials in type 1 diabetes (EASE-3 but not EASE-2) included a lower 2.5 mg dose. A placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction of 0.28% was demonstrated without the increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis observed at higher doses (10 mg and 25 mg). Since only one trial included the lower dose, we aimed to confirm the observed reduction in HbA1c for the 2.5 mg dose by modelling and simulation analyses.

Results

The simulated 26-week mean HbA1c change was -0.41% without insulin dose adjustment and-0.29% at 26weeks with insulin dose adjustment. A simplified (descriptive) model excluding insulin dose and mean daily glucose confirmed the -0.29% HbA1c change that would have been observed had the EASE-2 population received a 2.5mg dose for 26/52weeks.

Conclusions

The HbA1c benefit of low-dose empagliflozin directly observed in the EASE-3 trial was confirmed by two modelling and simulation approaches.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^1167v8gA]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study uses a specific SGLT radiotracer and PET imaging to show that glucose uptake into low-grade and high-grade gliomas, WHO grade II and IV, is mediated at least in part by SGLT2. Me4FDG is a specific, non-metabolized tracer for sodium glucose transporters that is not a substrate for GLUTs. SGLTs, couple the uphill transport of glucose into cells to the sodium electrochemical potential gradient across the cell membrane. The SGLT2 isoform is normally restricted to the kidney proximal tubule where it is largely responsible for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate. The kidneys filter about 180 g of glucose from plasma each day but less than 0.5 g are voided in the urine and SGLT2 is responsible for ∼ 50% of the kidney glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 drugs such as Jardiance R block this component.

We have previously reported that SGLT2 is expressed in glioblastomas. Namely, we have demonstrated that Me4FDG is accumulated in high grade astrocytomas using PET, and that SGLT2 protein is expressed in neoplastic cells and the endothelium lining tumor microvasculature of the glioblastomas. Here we extend this work to show that Jardiance R, (empagliflozin), a highly potent and specific inhibitor of SGLT2 activity in cells and in vivo, inhibits Me4FDG uptake into both high-grade and low-grade tumors (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). The effectiveness of oral doses of Jardiance in our patients is confirmed by (i) the increase in excretion of Me4FDG into the urinary bladder and (ii) the inhibition of Me4FDG uptake into extracranial muscles.

The brain background values (BG) were 365 vs. 341 Bq/g, in the absence and presence of Jardiance and this confirmed that there are no functional SGLTs, specifically SGLT2, in the normal blood-brain-barrier (BBB). The S/N ratio for white/gray matter remote from the tumor was 0.09 (N 3)[5]. For the extracranial temporalis muscle, the SUVR peak was 1.47+-0.03 (N 3) before and 1.21 ± 0.03 (N 3) after Jardiance demonstrating that SGLT2 contributes to glucose uptake into this muscle

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^1118bpo8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated kidney benefits in clinical trials across a broad range of patients with cardio-renal-metabolic diseases.
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the risk of a composite kidney outcome by 46%, compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the kidney benefits seen with SGLT2 inhibitors remain undetermined.

This study adds:

In this post hoc mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were the strongest mediators of the empagliflozin treatment kidney benefit.

Potential impact:

These findings complement previous analyses on the reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure seen with empagliflozin, showing that markers of plasma volume and/or red blood cell mass appear to mediate to a large degree the cardio-kidney organ protection in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.
The predominance of hematocrit and hemoglobin as mediators of empagliflozin's kidney benefits may suggest an erythropoietic mechanism of action, potentially linked to the alleviation of organ hypoxia.
Further studies are required to validate the underlying mechanisms suggested by the findings of this study.

14.5 Empagliflozin Chronic Kidney Disease Trial, Including Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The effectiveness of empagliflozin, a component of SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR, to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization has been established in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression based on an adequate and well-controlled study of empagliflozin [EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110)]. This trial was designed to determine the treatment effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo in adults with CKD (with and without type 2 diabetes). The trial, which studied empagliflozin rather than SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, included adults taking metformin HCl as a concomitant medication. The efficacy results of EMPA-KIDNEY are reported below.

EMPA-KIDNEY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease [eGFR ≥ 20 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥ 45 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 200 mg/g]. The trial excluded patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the preceding three months or > 45 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of screening. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard of care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or CV death. A total of 6,609 patients, were equally randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg orally once-daily or placebo and were followed for a median of 24 months.

### A complete review of empagliflozin: most specific and potent SGLT2 inhibitor used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1127s8mN]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the latest class of drugs to be introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They reduce hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion and exert favorable effects beyond glucose control with consistent body weight, blood pressure, and serum uric acid reductions. Empagliflozin is a potent SGLT2 inhibitor used to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. It has the highest SGLT2 specificity among all the clinically used or currently tested SGLT2 inhibitors. Low risk of hypoglycemia, absence of weight gain and demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction support its consideration as a first line medication in addition to metformin for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Mostly reported adverse events are genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections and events linked to volume depletion are rather rare. This review covers the complete information on empagliflozin including the history of its development, synthesis, pharmacology and different methods which have been reported for its analysis.

### Effect of jardiance on glucose uptake into astrocytomas [^1123jGBo]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

SGLT2, the sodium glucose cotransporter two, is expressed in human pancreatic, prostate and brain tumors, and in a mouse cancer model SGLT2 inhibitors reduce tumor glucose uptake and growth. In this study we have measured the effect of a specific SGLT2 inhibitor, Jardiance® (Empagliflozin), on glucose uptake into astrocytomas in patients.

Methods

We have used a specific SGLT glucose tracer, α-methyl-4-[18 F]fluoro-4-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranoside (Me4FDG), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to measure glucose uptake. Four of five patients enrolled had WHO grade IV glioblastomas, and one had a low grade WHO Grade II astrocytoma. Two dynamic brain PET scans were conducted on each patient, one before and one after treatment with a single oral dose of Jardiance, a specific SGLT2 inhibitor. As a control, we also determined the effect of oral Jardiance on renal SGLT2 activity.

Results

In all five patients an oral dose (25 or 100 mg) of Jardiance reduced Me4FDG tumor accumulation, highly significant inhibition in four, and inhibited SGLT2 activity in the kidney.

Conclusions

These initial experiments show that SGLT2 is a functional glucose transporter in astocytomas, and Jardiance inhibited glucose uptake, a drug approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), heart failure, and renal failure. We suggest that clinical trials be initiated to determine whether Jardiance reduces astrocytoma growth in patients.

### SGLT2 inhibitors through the windows of EMPA-REG and CANVAS trials: a review [^114KkssN]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2008 regulations mandate the sponsors to conduct cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) for ensuring cardiovascular (CV) safety of newly marketed antidiabetes agents. The sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) have entered the world market after this mandatory requirement, hence necessitating the need for CVOTs. These trials are required to exhibit a two-sided 95% CI upper boundary of hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1.3 for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in comparison to the control group. Therefore, CVOTs have been conducted for both empagliflozin and canagliflozin to test for non-inferiority for the prespecified primary CV outcome variables with HR of less than 1.3. Understandably, the population included in these CVOTs had high CV risk, so as to have maximum CV events (CVE) within the stipulated time period, thus providing an opportunity to assess the CV safety of these drugs.

The CV outcome results of empagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in type 2 diabetes trial (EMPA-REG) and canagliflozin cardiovascular assessment study (CANVAS) with empagliflozin and canagliflozin, respectively, have demonstrated tangible benefits beyond the thoughts of the diabetes-treating community. Previously, metformin and liraglutide have demonstrated CV benefits independent of glycemic control in patients with T2DM in the UKPDS study and LEADER study, respectively. The SGLT2i are another class of oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs) that have exhibited beneficial CV outcomes independent of glycemic control. Do the CV benefits with empagliflozin and canagliflozin mirror each other and have similar implications? We herein dissect the CV and renal outcomes of EMPA-REG and CANVAS trials with their implications in clinical practice.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### Review on obesity management: diet, exercise and pharmacotherapy [^1147WYxr]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors are also common weight loss medications (table 2). These drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment of type II diabetes and can be taken in conjunction with metformin to control insulin levels. Recently, studies have shown that SGLT2 is also cause weight loss and can be used as antiobesity drugs. These drugs share a mechanism of action where they reduce renal tubular glucose absorption and subsequently reduce blood glucose without stimulating insulin production. This reduces the amount of glucose the body absorbs, and consequently, the number of calories absorbed. So far, there exists four main SGLT2is being used in the clinic: canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance) and ertugliflozin (Steglatro). On average, regular use of SGLT2 is results in an approximate 3 kg of weight loss. Common side effects include urinary tract infections, genital yeast infections, increased urination, dyslipidaemia, thirst and painful urination. More rare side effects include kidney injury and ketoacidosis.

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

JARDIANCE is indicated:

to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure.
to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Limitations of Use

JARDIANCE is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

JARDIANCE is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. JARDIANCE is likely to be ineffective in this setting based upon its mechanism of action.

JARDIANCE is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring or with a recent history of intravenous immunosuppressive therapy or greater than 45 mg of prednisone or equivalent for kidney disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. JARDIANCE is not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Empagliflozin and protecting microvascular support of heart Mechanics: SGLT2 inhibition or more? [^117Brnn4]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

This new study also raises interesting questions as to whether the molecular mechanisms that govern the therapeutic effects of this emerging class of agents are specific to the inhibition of SGLT2. Though SGLT1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the human heart and in other tissues, SGLT2, the selective target of empagliflozin, has been largely identified in skeletal muscle and kidney but not in heart. Some studies have indicated that SGLT2 may be expressed at low levels in endothelial cells, but the authors of the current investigation acknowledge that they and others have been unable to consistently detect SGLT2 from the CMEC. Improvements in the current forms of detection for SGLT2 RNA and protein may certainly be required. Ultimately, gene knockdown by small double-stranded interfering RNAs targeting SGLT2 in the CMEC or isolation of primary endothelial cells from SGLT2 knock-out mice may be helpful in confirming the specificity of the empagliflozin effect.

It is possible that empagliflozin has an effect, either directly or indirectly, on an alternative cation transport protein, the Na + /H + exchanger-1 (NHE-1), leading to the reductions in mitochondrial ROS. Recent studies demonstrated that empagliflozin lowered cytosolic [Na +] and [Ca 2+] while enhancing mitochondrial [Ca 2+], through impairment of NHE-1. Prior studies have focused on cardiomyocytes, but it is possible empagliflozin may have similar effects on microvascular endothelial cells given that they also express NHE-1. Direct inhibition of NHE-1 by cariporide decreased ROS production, induced the regression of cardiac hypertrophy, and exerted beneficial effects in experimental HF. These actions may be cardioprotective, in part, because both increased cardiac intracellular Na+ and NHE activity have been linked to the occurrence of arrhythmias, myocardial hypertrophy, and aggravation of HF. Future studies involving conditional deletion systems of SGLT2 or NHE-1 in experimental models of HF are required to further dissect this new mechanism. Of note, targeting NHE-1 with cariporide clinically for the treatment of ischemia reperfusion injury was studied over a decade ago in the GAUARDIAN (Guard During Ischemia Against Necrosis) and EXPEDITION (The Na + /H + Exchanger Inhibition to Prevent Coronary Events in Acute Cardiac Conditions) trials, and despite evidence of reduced myocardial injury, increased mortality caused by cerebrovascular events raised concerns about clinical safety. There may be something different about the study populations or the way empagliflozin is targeting mitochondrial NHE-1 to reduce mitochondrial ROS, but whatever the case, it is clear that more study is needed in this area.

Patients treated with metformin (at least 1,000 mg daily or maximally tolerated dose), with or without insulin therapy, and those with a history of intolerance to metformin therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized to 3 treatment arms (JARDIANCE 10 mg, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or placebo), over 26 weeks. Patients in the JARDIANCE 10 mg group who failed to achieve HbA1c < 7.0% at Week 12 underwent a second randomization at Week 14 to remain on the 10 mg dose or increase to 25 mg. Patients on placebo were re-randomized at Week 26 to one of the JARDIANCE doses (10 mg or 25 mg) or a DPP-4 inhibitor.

A total of 157 patients were treated with either JARDIANCE (10 mg or 25 mg; N = 52), a DPP-4 inhibitor (N = 52), or placebo (N = 53). Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.1 years. The mean age was 14.5 years (range: 10–17 years) and 51.6% were aged 15 years and older. Approximately, 50% were White, 6% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 36.0 kg/m2and mean BMI Z-score was 3.0. Patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2were not enrolled in the trial. Approximately 25% of the study population had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.

At Week 26, treatment with JARDIANCE was superior in reducing HbA1c from baseline versus placebo (see Table 14).
