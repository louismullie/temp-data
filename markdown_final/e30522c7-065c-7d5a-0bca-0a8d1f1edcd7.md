## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the remainder when 104²⁰⁰⁶ is divided by 29, with options A. 5, B. 27, C. 28, D. 13. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about reducing the base modulo 29. Then, I should verify whether Fermat's Little Theorem applies and how to use it. Next, I will simplify the exponent modulo 28 and compute the resulting power. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the answer to the choices.

> Let me first confirm the base reduction. 104 divided by 29 is 3 with a remainder of 17, so 104 ≡ 17 (mod 29). Therefore, 104²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17²⁰⁰⁶ (mod 29), which simplifies the problem to computing 17²⁰⁰⁶ mod 29 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the modulus for the exponent. Since 29 is prime, Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that aᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p) for any integer a not divisible by p, so 17²⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 29). That means I can reduce the exponent 2006 modulo 28 to simplify the calculation [^notfound].

> I need to check the exponent reduction carefully. 2006 divided by 28 is 71 with a remainder of 18, so 2006 ≡ 18 (mod 28). Therefore, 17²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17¹⁸ (mod 29). Hold on, I should verify that division: 28 × 71 = 1988, and 2006 − 1988 = 18, so yes, the remainder is 18 [^notfound].

> Next, I should compute 17¹⁸ mod 29. Let me think about efficient exponentiation. I can square repeatedly and keep reducing modulo 29 at each step to keep numbers small. 17² = 289 ≡ 289 − 10×29 = 289 − 290 = −1 ≡ 28 (mod 29). Then 17⁴ ≡ (−1)² = 1 (mod 29). So 17⁴ ≡ 1, which means 17¹⁸ = 17⁽⁴×4 + 2⁾ = (17⁴)⁴ × 17² ≡ 1⁴ × 28 ≡ 28 (mod 29) [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 17² ≡ −1 might lead to 17¹⁸ ≡ −1, but that would be incorrect because 18 is not an odd multiple of 2. Let me reconsider: 17² ≡ 28 ≡ −1, so 17⁴ ≡ 1, and 18 = 4×4 + 2, so the result is 1⁴ × 17² ≡ 28, not −1. I should double-check that logic, and it holds [^notfound].

> Therefore, 104²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17¹⁸ ≡ 28 (mod 29). Looking at the options, 28 corresponds to choice C, so the correct answer is C. 28 [^notfound].

---

The remainder when (104²⁰⁰⁶) is divided by 29 is **28**. This is found by reducing the base modulo 29 to get (104 ≡ 17 (mod 29)), then applying Fermat's Little Theorem to reduce the exponent modulo 28, yielding (17²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17¹⁸ (mod 29)). Computing (17¹⁸ (mod 29)) gives 28, so the correct answer is **C. 28**.

---

## Step 1: Reduce the base modulo 29

First, reduce the base 104 modulo 29:

104 ÷ 29 = 3 remainder 17 ⇒ 104 ≡ 17 (mod 29)

Thus, (104²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17²⁰⁰⁶ (mod 29)).

---

## Step 2: Apply Fermat's Little Theorem

Since 29 is prime, Fermat's Little Theorem states that for any integer (a) not divisible by 29:

a²⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 29)

Therefore, (17²⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 29)).

---

## Step 3: Reduce the exponent modulo 28

Next, reduce the exponent 2006 modulo 28:

2006 ÷ 28 = 71 remainder 18 ⇒ 2006 ≡ 18 (mod 28)

Thus, (17²⁰⁰⁶ ≡ 17¹⁸ (mod 29)).

---

## Step 4: Compute (17¹⁸ (mod 29))

We compute (17¹⁸ (mod 29)) using successive squaring:

- (17² = 289 ≡ 289 − 10 × 29 = 289 − 290 = −1 (mod 29))
- (17⁴ = (17²)² ≡ (−1)² = 1 (mod 29))
- (17⁸ = (17⁴)² ≡ 1² = 1 (mod 29))
- (17¹⁶ = (17⁸)² ≡ 1² = 1 (mod 29))

Now, express (17¹⁸) as:

17¹⁸ = 17¹⁶ × 17² ≡ 1 × (−1) = −1 (mod 29)

Since (−1 ≡ 28 (mod 29)), we have:

17¹⁸ ≡ 28 (mod 29)

---

## Conclusion

Therefore, the remainder when (104²⁰⁰⁶) is divided by 29 is **28**, which corresponds to option **C**.

---

The remainder when (104²⁰⁰⁶) is divided by 29 is **28**.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### The law of diminishing returns in clinical medicine: how much risk reduction is enough? [^29e1cf88]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The law of diminishing returns, first described by economists to explain why, beyond a certain point, additional inputs produce smaller and smaller outputs, offers insight into many situations encountered in clinical medicine. For example, when the risk of an adverse event can be reduced in several different ways, the impact of each intervention can generally be shown mathematically to be reduced by the previous ones. The diminishing value of successive interventions is further reduced by adverse consequences (eg, drug-drug, drug-disease, and drug-nutrient interactions), as well as by the total expenditures of time, energy, and resources, which increase with each additional intervention. It is therefore important to try to prioritize interventions based on patient-centered goals and the relative impact and acceptability of the interventions. We believe that this has implications for clinical practice, research, and policy.

### Remaining effect of influenza vaccines received in prior seasons [^7e8a75e9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

This study evaluates the remaining effect of influenza vaccines received in the 5 prior seasons. During 7 influenza seasons, 8933 patients were enrolled and 47% were confirmed for influenza. Compared with unvaccinated individuals in the current and 5 prior seasons, vaccination was protective when the last dose had been received in the current season (40% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 32%-47%]), and 1 (42% [95% CI, 27%-54%]), 2–3 (35% [95% CI, 16%-49%]), or 4–5 seasons (31% [95% CI, 4%-51%]) prior. This effect lasted for fewer seasons in the elderly and in patients with chronic conditions. On average, several recent prior doses were as protective as current-season vaccination.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^35a64a94]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium study design

The Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium studyincludes data from general population cohorts, cohorts at high risk of cardiovascular events, and cohorts with chronic kidney disease. These cohorts are described in appendices 1–3 on bmj.com. Eligible cohorts contained at least 1000 participants (except chronic kidney disease cohorts), outcomes of either mortality or end stage renal disease with a minimum of 50 events, and baseline information on estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Measures of albuminuria included the albumin-creatinine ratio (the preferred measure), protein-creatinine ratio, and qualitative measures using dipstick proteinuria. Adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were included.

Study covariates

The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m². In general population and high risk cohorts, estimated glomerular filtration rate was categorised as < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–74, 75–89, 90–104, or ≥ 105 mL/min/1.73 m², according to current clinical guidelines. Albuminuria was categorised as "negative", "high normal", "mild", or "heavy" depending on whether urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or urinary dipstick tests were available (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio < 10, 10–29, 30–299, ≥ 300 mg/g; dipstick proteinuria negative, trace, 1+, 2+ or more). These categories were adapted for chronic kidney disease cohorts to reflect the lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (categories < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–74, ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m²) and higher levels of albuminuria or proteinuria (albumin-creatinine ratio < 30, 30–299, 300–999, ≥ 1000 mg/g; protein-creatinine ratio < 50, 50–499, 500–1,499, ≥ 1,500 mg/g). To derive urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or protein-creatinine ratio in mg/mmol from the mg/g cut-off values, we divided them by 8.84. For ease of reading, we have omitted units for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in the remainder of this manuscript.

### Health care and productivity costs associated with diabetic patients with macrovascular comorbid conditions [^4c544808]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Variables of interest

We measured the direct cost by the total health care expenditure of the calendar year for each subject. The 2004 and 2006 costs were adjusted to 2006 dollars using the medical care component of the consumer price index. Indirect productivity cost was calculated from both days of work missed due to illness or injury and additional missed days that the study subjects spent in bed due to illness or injury. In the MEPS, employed individuals were asked in each round how many days of work they missed due to illness or injury. An additional bed day was the measure of lost productivity for both employed and unemployed individuals. The cost of missed work days and additional bed days was estimated on the basis of the 2006 average national hourly wage across U.S. occupations with an hourly wage of 19.29 USD. Because MEPS does not differentiate between missed full and partial days, we assumed each missed day to be 6 h with the indirect cost of 115.74/day USD (19.29 USD/h × 6 h). The indirect cost per person was the product of the indirect cost per day and the total number of missed work days and additional bed days for an individual within a year.

We used clinical classification categories (CCCs) defined in the MEPS to represent disease conditions. CCCs were generated using the clinical classification software by AHRQ. It aggregates the ICD-9-CM conditions and V-codes into 260 mutually exclusive clinically homogeneous categories. We used CCC 49 "diabetes without complication" and CCC 50 "diabetes with complication" to identify patients with diabetes. The MVCCs were defined using CCC codes 100, 101, 104, and 108–115, which included cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, aortic/visceral/peripheral aneurysms, visceral atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease) and cerebrovascular disease (strokes and transient ischemic attacks).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in cardiovascular care: Over the next 30 years, cardiovascular disease health care costs in the United States are expected to quadruple, from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, increasing from 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing intervention effectiveness against incremental resource use; they are not simply about minimizing costs but about evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the next best alternative to maximize population health benefits, and they provide efficiency estimates to inform decision-making at the policy and system level.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — importance and projected cardiovascular disease costs are outlined: Over the next 30 years, health care costs attributable to cardiovascular disease in the United States are expected to quadruple, even after accounting for inflation — from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, an increase from 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of the projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing the effectiveness of an intervention against the incremental use of resources, and it is important to note that CEAs are not simply about minimizing costs: they systematically evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the best alternative to maximize the population health benefits, given finite available resources.

### Spatial and temporal patterns of malaria in phu yen province, Vietnam, from 2005 to 2016 [^86e3ca0a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study sites and data sources.

Phu Yen is located in the South Central Coastal region of Vietnam. Phu Yen is administratively divided into nine districts and 104 communes (Figure 1). The total population of Phu Yen in 2016 was 875,387. Numbers of reported P. falciparum and P. vivax cases by commune and by month from January 2005 to December 2016 and ITN/IRS data were provided by the NIMPE. Commune-level population data were provided by Phu Yen provincial council. Commune population was imputed by month as follows: the difference in the district population in 2004 and 2005 was calculated and then divided by 12 to allow for a monthly population increase in 2005. A similar approach was used to calculate the monthly population of the rest of the study period (2006–2016). High-resolution (1 km² [30 arc-seconds]) raster maps of interpolated long-term (1950–2000) average monthly precipitation and temperature were obtained from the WORLDCLIM website. Precipitation and temperature maps were imported into a geographical information system (GIS) (GIS; ArcMap version 10.5, ESRI, Redlands, CA) and linked spatially to a digitized boundary map of the 104 communes of Phu Yen Province. The monthly mean of precipitation and temperature were extracted for each study commune using Zonal Statistics functions in ArcMap (ESRI, Redlands, CA).

Exploration of seasonal patterns and temporal trends.

The monthly malaria incidences by Plasmodium species were calculated for the full time series (January 2005–December 2016). The time series of malaria incidence was decomposed using seasonal-trend decomposition based on locally weighted regression to show the seasonal pattern, the temporal trend, and the residual variability. The time series data, the seasonal component, the trend component, and the remainder component are denoted by Y t, S t, T t, and R t, respectively, for month t = 1 to N, andThe parameter setting "periodic" was used for the seasonal extraction, and all other parameters were by default. In the study, logarithmic transformations were used for the time series data.

Cost/value methodology — study design for economic evaluations: Both trial-based and population-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) can inform economic value statements; trial-based CEAs can prospectively capture costs and quality-of-life data and preserve cost–outcome correlations, whereas population-based computer simulation models (Markov cohort or microsimulation) may more closely reflect real-world populations and costs. The analytic time horizon in trial-based analyses can be limited to trial follow-up or extended beyond the trial, and all model-based analyses require careful attention to assumptions regarding cardiovascular risk, adherence, effectiveness, safety, and costs.

RCT Reporting Practices

Regarding reporting practices, 191 RCTs (93.6%) reported sex proportions, and 109 (53.4%) reported either the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Of note, the racial and ethnic reporting practices have increased between the first and the second half of the study period (1992–2006: 27.8% [10 of 36]; 2007–2024: 59.5% [99 of 167]) (Figure 4 A). Among studies reporting sex, 150 (78.5%) included 50% to 70% of women, 29 (15.2%) included 30% to 50% of women, and 12 (6.3%) included more than 70% of women. Among those reporting race, 104 (95.4%) had predominantly White samples, while 5 (4.6%) had predominantly East Asian samples. More than 80% of the sample was a part of the majority group in 104 studies (95.4%).

Figure 4.
Trends in Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Reporting and Transparency Practices

Open science practices showed similar trends to that of racial reporting. Registration to platforms such as ClinicalTrials.gov has drastically shifted from 16.7% (6 of 36 studies) in 1992 to 2006 to 89.2% (149 of 167 studies) in 2007 to 2024. The practice of sharing RCT data is more novel; it was first encountered in 2018, but it reached 51.4% (18 of 35 studies) between 2022 and 2024 (Figure 4 B). However, data sharing conditions varied widely, ranging from being available upon request to granting open access to the anonymized dataset.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^0f9f2fa2]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

Among the 34 reporting areas ††††† that provided data for the relevant years of comparison (2006 versus 2015, 2006 versus 2010, 2011 versus 2015, and 2014 versus 2015), the percentage of women who had no previous abortions increased 2% (from 57.8% to 59.1%), whereas there was a 4% decrease for women who had one or two previous abortions, and the percentage of women who had three or more previous abortions was unchanged (6.4%) from 2006 to 2015. However, the percentage of women who had no previous abortions decreased 1% from 2006 to 2010 (from 57.8% to 57.4%) and then increased 3% from 2011 to 2015 (from 57.2% to 59.1%). By contrast, the percentage of women who had three or more previous abortions increased 11.0% from 2006 to 2010 (from 6.4% to 7.1%) then decreased 9% from 2011 to 2015 (from 7.0% to 6.4%). The percentage of women who had one or two previous abortions remained stable from 2006 to 2010 (35.7% to 35.6%) and then decreased 4% from 2011 to 2015 (from 35.8% to 34.4%)".

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^d8dda94b]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Authors should provide sufficient information such that the reader can assess the methods used to generate the random allocation sequence and the likelihood of bias in group assignment. Any software used for random sequence generation should also be reported. It is important that information on the process of randomisation is included in the body of the main article and not as a separate supplementary file, where it can be missed by the reader.

The term "random" has a precise technical meaning. With random allocation, each participant has a known probability of receiving each intervention before one is assigned, and the assigned intervention is determined by a chance process and cannot be predicted. However, "random" is sometimes used inappropriately in the literature to describe trials in which non-random, "deterministic" allocation methods were used, such as alternation, hospital numbers, or date of birth. When investigators use such non-random methods, they should describe them precisely and should not use the term "random" or any variation of it. Even the term "quasi-random" is unacceptable for describing such trials. Trials based on non-random methods generally yield biased results; bias presumably arises from the inability to adequately conceal these more predictable, non-random sequence generation systems.

Many methods of sequence generation are adequate. However, readers cannot judge adequacy from such terms as "random allocation", "randomisation", or "random" without further elaboration. Authors should specify the method of sequence generation, such as a random-number table or a computerised random number generator. The sequence may be generated by the process of minimisation, a non-random but generally acceptable method.

In some trials, participants are intentionally allocated in unequal numbers to each intervention: for example, to gain more experience with a new procedure or to limit costs of the trial. In such cases, authors should report the randomisation ratio (eg, 2:1, or two treatment participants per control participant; item 9).

In a representative sample of PubMed indexed trials in 2000, only 21% reported an adequate approach to random sequence generation; this increased to 34% for a similar cohort of PubMed indexed trials in 2006. Two more recent studies showed further small increases to about 40%, but another reported a stubbornly similar level of 32%. When authors report an adequate approach to random sequence generation, in over 90% of cases they report using a random number generator on a computer or a random number table.

### Why population attributable fractions can sum to more than one [^48796442]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Population attributable fractions (PAFs) are useful for estimating the proportion of disease cases that could be prevented if risk factors were reduced or eliminated. For diseases with multiple risk factors, PAFs of individual risk factors can sum to more than 1, a result suggesting the impossible situation in which more than 100% of cases are preventable.

Methods

A hypothetical example in which risk factors for a disease were eliminated in different sequences was analyzed to show why PAFs can sum to more than 1.

Results

PAF estimates assume each risk factor is the first to be eliminated, thereby describing mutually exclusive scenarios that are illogical to sum, except under special circumstances. PAFs can sum to more than 1 because some individuals with more than one risk factor can have disease prevented in more than one way, and the prevented cases of these individuals could be counted more than once. Upper and lower limits of sequential attributable fractions (SAFs) can be calculated to describe the maximum and minimum proportions of the original number of disease cases that would be prevented if a particular risk factor were eliminated.

Conclusions

Improved descriptions of the assumptions that underlie the PAF calculations, use of SAF limits, or multivariable PAFs would help avoid unrealistic estimates of the disease burden that would be prevented after resources are expended to reduce or eliminate multiple risk factors.

Objective

This article will address ongoing efforts to track cumulative dose estimates of patient radiation exposure that have the potential to transform radiation protection research.

Conclusion

There is no clear consensus on how to use this information clinically. A rational consideration of this question reveals that until the linear no-threshold model is supplanted, cumulative dose estimates are of little clinical relevance and never constitute a logical reason to avoid an imaging evaluation that is otherwise medically indicated.

Recommendation #4 — Don't Use Expensive Medications When an Equally Effective and Lower-Cost Medication Is Available highlights that, on average, the cost of a generic drug is 80% — 85% lower than the brand name product while having the same active ingredients, strength, and similar effectiveness. Physicians' cost accuracy is low, with less than 50% of estimates accurate by any definition of cost accuracy, and patient preference for generics is limited, with only 37.6% preferring generics for their own health. Increasing generic utilization can yield large savings; for every 10% increase in the use of generic cholesterol drugs, Medicare costs could be reduced by $1 billion annually. Adherence data from more than 90,000 Medicare beneficiaries showed higher adherence to generic statins compared with brand name statins and a lower composite outcome of hospitalization and death.

### Cost-effectiveness of immediate total-body CT in patients with severe trauma (REACT-2 trial) [^09333df6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The effect of immediate total-body CT (iTBCT) on health economic aspects in patients with severe trauma is an underreported issue. This study determined the cost-effectiveness of iTBCT compared with conventional radiological imaging with selective CT (standard work-up (STWU)) during the initial trauma evaluation.

Methods

In this multicentre RCT, adult patients with a high suspicion of severe injury were randomized in-hospital to iTBCT or STWU. Hospital healthcare costs were determined for the first 6 months after the injury. The probability of iTBCT being cost-effective was calculated for various levels of willingness-to-pay per extra patient alive.

Results

A total of 928 Dutch patients with complete clinical follow-up were included. Mean costs of hospital care were €25 809 (95 per cent bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) c.i. €22 617 to €29 137) for the iTBCT group and €26 155 (€23 050 to €29 344) for the STWU group, a difference per patient in favour of iTBCT of €346 (€4987 to €4328) (P = 0.876). Proportions of patients alive at 6 months were not different. The proportion of patients alive without serious morbidity was 61.6 per cent in the iTBCT group versus 66.7 per cent in the STWU group (difference −5.1 per cent; P = 0.104). The probability of iTBCT being cost-effective in keeping patients alive remained below 0.56 for the whole group, but was higher in patients with multiple trauma (0.8–0.9) and in those with traumatic brain injury (more than 0.9).

Conclusion

Economically, from a hospital healthcare provider perspective, iTBCT should be the diagnostic strategy of first choice in patients with multiple trauma or traumatic brain injury.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Evaluation of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and advance care planning among older adults [^02d60dcf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do rates of advance care planning vary by neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 13 104 older adults in the San Francisco Bay Area, those living in neighborhoods with lower nSES had lower odds of advanced care planning compared with those in neighborhoods with high nSES, with those in the lowest quintile having 29% lower odds. Mapping geocoded data allowed identification of 5 San Francisco neighborhoods with both low nSES and advance care planning.

Meaning

These findings may help to inform the development of multilevel interventions, including targeted, community-based program delivery to areas with the highest need and greatest disadvantage.

### Newborn dried blood spot samples in Denmark: the hidden figures of secondary use and research participation [^2db63860]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the 794,157 used samples, a relatively large number, 84,299, are from participants with a diagnosis. The possibility of participating in research therefore is higher for people with a diagnosis (which often only comes about when individuals reach childhood or adulthood). For instance, ~ 12,000 people born after 1982 are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (calculation based on). We found that 7509 individual NDBS samples from people with a type 1 diabetes diagnosis have been used for research purposes. This would suggest that an estimated 62% of all samples from patients with type 1 diabetes have been used for research purposes, an increase of 25 percentage points compared with the overall proportion found for the individuals with a Danish NDBS samples.

As shown in Fig. 3, the numbers of samples used vary widely from year to year. As for research fields, there is an early interest in toxoplasma, which was a part of the Danish newborn screening program from 1999 to 2007. The later years have shown a marked increase in two main areas: type 1 diabetes, and more especially in mental illness. This could suggest a shift in the kind of research the samples are used for: moving from objectives closely related to the primary purpose, to objectives completely unrelated to the primary purpose but the research fields shown in Fig. 3 are purely descriptive and do not provide any indication as to which research fields will be the main in the future.

The natural direct and indirect contribution of BL to cardiovascular and cardiac mortality were explored with time-stratification (1999–2002, 2003–2006, and 2007–2010). Figure 3 a–d shows that the HRs signifying the direct contribution of BL to cardiovascular and cardiac mortality were significant (P ≤ 0.03) in the 1999–2002 and 2003–2006 cycles, but no longer in the 2007–2010 cycle (P ≥ 0.90), while the indirect contributions mediated via systolic BP (P ≥ 0.07) or hypertension (P ≥ 0.53) were not significant in any cycle. Low SES was associated with higher BLs compared with the remainder of the study population (1999–2002: 1.97 vs. 1.65 μg/dl; 2003–2006: 1.83 vs. 1.48 μg/dl; 2007–2010: 1.51 vs. 1.29 μg/dl; P < 0.001 for all). Low SES was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cardiac mortality (Figure 3, Panels E-F), while the indirect associations running via BL were significant for the 1999–2002 and 2003–2006 cycles (P ≤ 0.04), but not for the 2007–2010 cycle (P ≥ 0.74).

Table 5 — Distribution of estimated 10-year risk of a first hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event in the CVD-free, nonpregnant US population aged 40 to 79 years is organized by predicted 10-year risk categories < 2.5%, 2.5%–4.9%, 5.0%–7.4%, 7.5%–9.9%, 10.0%–14.9%, 15.0%–19.9%, and ≥ 20.0%. In the overall population, the percentages (95% CI) are 33.4 (31.2–35.5), 21.0 (19.4–22.7), 12.7 (11.4–14.0), 7.4 (6.5–8.3), 8.9 (8.1–9.6), 6.3 (5.6–7.1), and 10.2 (9.5–11.0), with corresponding n of 33 534 000, 21 151 000, 12 766 000, 7 470 000, 8 940 000, 6 380 000, and 10 300 000. Among men, the percentages (95% CI) are 17.4 (15.2–19.7), 22.7 (20.3–25.1), 15.6 (13.8–17.4), 10.1 (8.5–11.6), 12.1 (10.7–13.5), 8.8 (7.4–10.2), and 13.3 (12.1–14.4), with n of 8 386 000, 10 950 000, 7 511 000, 4 847 000, 5 849 000, 4 248 000, and 6 388 000.

### Cost-effectiveness of immediate total-body CT in patients with severe trauma (REACT-2 trial) [^75c0fa68]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of immediate total-body CT (iTBCT) on health economic aspects in patients with severe trauma is an underreported issue. This study determined the cost-effectiveness of iTBCT compared with conventional radiological imaging with selective CT (standard work-up (STWU)) during the initial trauma evaluation.

Methods

In this multicentre RCT, adult patients with a high suspicion of severe injury were randomized in-hospital to iTBCT or STWU. Hospital healthcare costs were determined for the first 6 months after the injury. The probability of iTBCT being cost-effective was calculated for various levels of willingness-to-pay per extra patient alive.

Results

A total of 928 Dutch patients with complete clinical follow-up were included. Mean costs of hospital care were €25 809 (95 per cent bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) c.i. €22 617 to €29 137) for the iTBCT group and €26 155 (€23 050 to €29 344) for the STWU group, a difference per patient in favour of iTBCT of €346 (€4987 to €4328) (P = 0.876). Proportions of patients alive at 6 months were not different. The proportion of patients alive without serious morbidity was 61.6 per cent in the iTBCT group versus 66.7 per cent in the STWU group (difference -5.1 per cent; P = 0.104). The probability of iTBCT being cost-effective in keeping patients alive remained below 0.56 for the whole group, but was higher in patients with multiple trauma (0.8–0.9) and in those with traumatic brain injury (more than 0.9).

Conclusion

Economically, from a hospital healthcare provider perspective, iTBCT should be the diagnostic strategy of first choice in patients with multiple trauma or traumatic brain injury.

HIV incidence surveillance through the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) — testing history information (THI) among persons aged ≥ 13 years newly diagnosed during 2006–2009 from 18 jurisdictions — is summarized as follows: An estimated total of 125,104 persons aged ≥ 13 years were newly diagnosed; THI was available for 57,476 (46%). Compared with those without THI, persons with THI more often were aged 13–29 years (37.8% versus 24.8%) or had male-to-male sexual contact (73.0% versus 68.5%), and less often were aged 40–49 years (23.0% versus 29.5%) or aged ≥ 50 years (13.4% versus 19.8%). Among adults and adolescents with THI, 41% were diagnosed at their first HIV test and 59% had a prior negative test; among those testing HIV-negative ≤ 12 months before diagnosis, the highest percentages were aged 13–29 years (33%), males with HIV transmission attributed to male-to-male sexual contact (29%), and whites (28%). Among persons with THI, 59% (34,049) had ever had a negative HIV test before diagnosis, and of these, 32,752 (96%) had data available to calculate time from most recent negative test. THI was collected and used to determine whether persons ever had a previous negative HIV test and to calculate the time from their most recent negative test to HIV diagnosis.

### The experience of transitions in care in very old age: implications for general practice [^9b3da9c9]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Moving residence in very old age

CC75C's Year 21 (2006–07) survey included 44 of 48 surviving participants (92%). Fewer than half still lived in their own home (18/44, 41%), dropping to just over a quarter by the time they died (12/44, 27%). Figure 1 illustrates where participants had moved to before this survey and subsequently. Of those who had already moved, 29% (8/26) later moved again. Moves before this survey were several years previously, median 3.8 years (IQR: 1.3–5.9); moves for those who moved again were a median 2.3 years (IQR: 1.2–3.5) later. Two-thirds died before any later survey (30/44, 68%), some with no interview discussion of moving, but relevant qualitative data were available for the majority of participants who moved at any point (26/32, 80% of those who moved): the sample included in this analysis. Five of the 26 had moved before 2006, 15 moved during 2007, and six who moved during 2008–10 were interviewed in the final survey.

Figure 1.
This illustrates where participants had moved to before the qualitative interviews took place in Year 21 and subsequently. Of the participants who had already moved 29% (8/26) later moved again. Moves before this survey were on average several years before, median 3.8 years (IQR: 1.3–5.9), and moves for the remainder who subsequently moved were a median 2.3 years (IQR: 1.2–3.5) later. Two-thirds died before any later survey (30/44, 68%).

### The global economic crisis, household income and pre-adolescent overweight and underweight: a nationwide birth cohort study in Japan [^51b2ccc4]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Other variables

Parents reported household income (father's income, mother's income and other incomes) for the years 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010. The average household income for the years before the downturn in 2008 was compared with the household income in 2010 (after the crisis onset). Variables were generated for income reductions of > 30, > 20 and > 10%.

Number of household members was recorded in questionnaires from the years 2002, 2005 and 2006. Household income was divided by the square root of the number of household membersfor these years and income quartiles before the onset of the economic crisis were determined based on the average of the obtained values.

Father's and mother's education were reported at the 1.5 years follow-up and categorized into junior high school, high school, vocational school and higher education. Parents' age at birth of the child was categorized into < 20, 20–24, 25–29 and > 29 years. Residential area in 2011 (last follow-up) was grouped into the 20 designated cities as specified by the Japanese government, other cities and rural areas. Children were categorized as belonging to a three generation household — a potential risk factor for childhood overweight in Japan — if at least one grandparent was living in the household in 2011.

### Guideline for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings [^903df3d8]. CDC (2017). Medium credibility.

Norovirus gastroenteritis — background epidemiology and classification — notes that illness is typically self-limiting with diarrhea persisting for 2 to 5 days and is estimated to cause over 23 million gastroenteritis cases each year in the United States, representing approximately 60% of all acute gastroenteritis; pooled analyses estimate over 91,000 emergency room visits and 23,000 hospitalizations for severe diarrhea among children under the age of five annually. Noroviruses are classified into five genogroups with most human infections from GI and GII, and over 80% of confirmed human infections are associated with genotype GII.4; since 2002 multiple new GII.4 variants have emerged, and in late 2006 two new variants were detected across the United States resulting in a 254% increase in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in 2006 compared to 2005. CDC summary data for 2001–2005 indicate that caliciviruses, primarily norovirus, were responsible for 29% of all reported foodborne outbreaks.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^ca1dcdbd]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Item 7b. When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines

Examples — "Two interim analyses were performed during the trial. The levels of significance maintained an overall P value of 0.05 and were calculated according to the O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries. This final analysis used a Z score of 1.985 with an associated P value of 0.0471".

"An independent data and safety monitoring board periodically reviewed the efficacy and safety data. Stopping rules were based on modified Haybittle-Peto boundaries of 4 SD in the first half of the study and 3 SD in the second half for efficacy data, and 3 SD in the first half of the study and 2 SD in the second half for safety data. Two formal interim analyses of efficacy were performed when 50% and 75% of the expected number of primary events had accrued; no correction of the reported P value for these interim tests was performed".

Explanation — Many trials recruit participants over a long period. If an intervention is working particularly well or badly, the study may need to be ended early for ethical reasons. This concern can be addressed by examining results as the data accumulate, preferably by an independent data monitoring committee. However, performing multiple statistical examinations of accumulating data without appropriate correction can lead to erroneous results and interpretations. If the accumulating data from a trial are examined at five interim analyses that use a P value of 0.05, the overall false positive rate is nearer to 19% than to the nominal 5%.

Several group sequential statistical methods are available to adjust for multiple analyses, and their use should be pre-specified in the trial protocol. With these methods, data are compared at each interim analysis, and a P value less than the critical value specified by the group sequential method indicates statistical significance. Some trialists use group sequential methods as an aid to decision making, whereas others treat them as a formal stopping rule (with the intention that the trial will cease if the observed P value is smaller than the critical value).

Authors should report whether they or a data monitoring committee took multiple "looks" at the data and, if so, how many there were, what triggered them, the statistical methods used (including any formal stopping rule), and whether they were planned before the start of the trial, before the data monitoring committee saw any interim data by allocation, or some time thereafter. This information is often not included in published trial reports, even in trials that report stopping earlier than planned.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^9559e2b1]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 — Associations of chronic kidney disease (CKD) staging by estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) are presented as multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios; numbers reflect the adjusted hazard ratio compared with the reference cell. Columns are labeled Urine albumin-creatinine ratio, mg/g with categories < 10, 10–29, 30–299, and 300+, and rows denote eGFRcr-cys categories such as 90–104. For all-cause mortality (11 cohorts; 692 802 participants; 97 606 events), at eGFRcr-cys 90–104 the hazard ratios across ACR levels were ref, 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0. For myocardial infarction (10 cohorts; 649 365 participants; 17 926 events), at eGFRcr-cys 90–104 the hazard ratios across ACR levels were ref, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8. Within the CKD-PC collaboration, 720,736 individuals had measures of blood cystatin C in addition to having eGFRcr and ACR.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^3327f722]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 5–1 — estimated calorie needs per day by age, gender, and physical activity level provides Calorie Requirements (kcals) by Activity Level at three different levels of physical activity and states that the estimates are rounded to the nearest 200 calories and that an individual's calorie needs may be higher or lower than these average estimates. At age 2–3 years, daily estimates are 1,000–1,200 (sedentary), 1,000–1,400 (moderately active), and 1,000–1,400 (active). For females 9–13 years the values are 1,400–1,600, 1,600–2,000, and 1,800–2,200; for females 14–18 years they are 1,800, 2,000, and 2,400. For males 14–18 years the values are 2,000–2,400, 2,400–2,800, and 2,800–3,200; for males 19–30 years they are 2,400–2,600, 2,600–2,800, and 3,000. Sedentary means a lifestyle that includes only the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life, moderately active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, and active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life; estimates for females do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics, involuntary admissions under the mental health act 1983, and number of psychiatric beds in england 1996–2006 [^7d759dbd]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results

Admissions to NHS hospitals for mental disorders peaked in 1998, at 214 326. Over the study period from 1996 to 2006, yearly admissions declined by 11%, from 207 050 to 183 699. The reductions were confined to three subpopulations (figure): patients with learning disabilities (admission decreased by 58%), unipolar depression (33%), or dementia (28%). Since 2003, admissions for drug and alcohol related disorders increased by 29%, whereas admissions remained relatively stable for other groups — for example, 30 639 patients were admitted for schizophreniform disorders in 1996 compared with 30 852 in 2006.

Changes in admission rates (on logarithmic scale) to NHS hospitals for different diagnostic groups of mental disorders, 1996–2006

Over the decade the total number of involuntary admissions per annum increased by 20%, from 42 844 to 51 361; the number of civil detentions increased by 13%, from 38 938 to 43 820, and place of safety detentions increased by 189%, from 2037 to 5877, whereas forensic detentions decreased by 11%, from 1873 to 1664. The tableshows that on 31 March each year the number of involuntary inpatients in hospital increased by 27%, from 11 500 to 14 625, with noticeable increases in the numbers admitted to private facilities compared with NHS facilities (256% v 12%). The odds of an involuntary patient being admitted to hospital in a private facility increased threefold (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5), from 0.06 to 0.21 (700/10 800 patients v 2493/ 12 132).

Number of beds for mental illness and learning disability, and number of involuntary inpatients between 1996 and 2006, in England

*Correlation with number of NHS beds for mental disorder and learning disability.

†Number of involuntary patients in NHS facilities on 31 March divided by number of NHS beds for mental disorders and learning disability and multiplied by 100.

As the number of psychiatric beds decreased by 29% (47 333 to 33 729), the proportion of NHS beds occupied by involuntary patients increased, from 23% to 36% (table). A negative correlation was seen between the number of NHS beds and the number of involuntary patients in private facilities (r = −0.98, P < 0.001) or in NHS facilities (r = −0.64, P = 0.046).

### Do moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activities reduce mortality rates to the same extent? [^d8588bed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the men (mean age = 66.1 years [SD = 7.7 years]) and women (mean age = 54.6 years [SD = 7.0 years]) by total physical activity volume are in Table 1. Men expended a median of 18.6 MET‐h/week (25th percentile: 6.3; 75th percentile: 37.4) in physical activity; the median for women was 8.4 MET‐h/week (25th percentile: 2.7; 75th percentile: 20.5). Of the 7979 men at baseline (year 1988), 3551 died (1077 of CVD) during 17.3 mean years of follow‐up. Of the 38 761 women at baseline (year 1992), 3170 died (620 of CVD) during 16.4 mean years of follow‐up.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^a3788058]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Best practices guidelines in imaging — incidental findings communication and follow-up — advise to "Use evidence-based guidelines or criteria whenever feasible to avoid the costly work-up of findings that have doubtful clinical significance", noting that "When evidence-based guidelines are not utilized, studies report that the number of follow up recommendations increases", and to "Review prior reports and images whenever feasible" to avoid unnecessary follow-up. For findings requiring action, "communicate this clearly to the referring clinician and subsequently to the patient". Process standards include "It is recommended that the radiology report conform to the ACR Practice Parameter for Communication of Diagnostic Imaging Findings", "Record in the EHR that the incidental finding was communicated to the patient", and "Establish a procedure for communication of incidental findings added to any preliminary report and initial communication with the treating physician", with examples including "closed-loop communication" and "in some cases a case manager or software solution". Programmatic systems are emphasized: "Facilities are encouraged to use a communication system for all incidental findings", because without a systematic approach "reported rates of follow up are 9.8 to 29 percent", and "Munk et al. reported that fewer than half of the class 3 (most significant) incidental findings found on imaging were documented in the discharge summary". "Systems designed to ensure patient follow up improve both patient notification and follow up rates", and ultimately "it is recommended that trauma centers establish a defined system for follow up and management of these findings".
