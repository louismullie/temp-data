## Question

Which topical corticosteroid can be used on the face, and what dosage should be used?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which topical corticosteroids can be used on the face and what dosage should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique pharmacology and risks of facial skin and the core prescribing principles. Then, I should verify which specific corticosteroids have data supporting facial use and their regimens. Next, I need to consider potency selection frameworks, labeled contraindications, and special-case exceptions. After that, I should review safety monitoring, including ophthalmic risks and HPA-axis considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations with dosing by fingertip units, duration limits, and maintenance strategies, while flagging when non-steroidal alternatives are preferred [^116Wp8v2].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles specific to facial skin. The face has thinner stratum corneum and higher percutaneous absorption, so I need to minimize risk by choosing the lowest effective potency, limiting duration, avoiding occlusion, and using vehicles that reduce irritation in this sensitive area, because adverse effects scale with potency, treatment area, duration, and occlusion [^116Wp8v2]. I should also remember that occlusive dressings substantially increase systemic absorption, so these are generally avoided on the face unless explicitly directed by a specialist [^115ER8SW] [^1122Eu9X]. Correct patient application is critical; a standardized dosing approach is essential on the face to prevent over-application and cumulative toxicity [^116Wp8v2].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing mechanics and time limits I'm going to recommend. The fingertip unit method helps ensure thin, uniform application; one adult fingertip unit covers about 2% body surface area, which translates to roughly 2.5 fingertip units for the entire adult face, minimizing overuse on this high-absorption site [^116Wp8v2]. Regarding duration, super-high-potency steroids should not exceed about three weeks, high- and medium-potency up to twelve weeks, and low-potency agents do not have a specified maximum, but facial use still warrants intermittent or short courses with periodic reassessment to mitigate atrophy and telangiectasia risk [^116Wp8v2].

> Next, I will examine agents specifically studied for facial dermatoses where safety was prospectively assessed. Fluticasone propionate 0.005% ointment showed strong efficacy and a pragmatic intermittent regimen in moderate-to-severe facial and intertriginous psoriasis: twice daily for two weeks, then once daily on two consecutive days each week for an additional eight weeks, maintaining improvements in most patients and notably without observed skin atrophy or telangiectasia on these corticosteroid-sensitive sites [^115BhgK8]. Hold on, I should confirm potency context here; fluticasone propionate ointment is a mid-range agent in common systems, which supports its use in carefully structured, time-limited facial regimens when low-potency options are insufficient [^115BhgK8].

> I need to check data for low-potency choices on the face, especially for seborrheic dermatitis. Hydrocortisone 1% ointment applied twice daily was as effective as tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in a small randomized study of facial seborrheic dermatitis, with a similar safety profile and no atrophy observed in that trial, supporting hydrocortisone as a first-line facial option for inflammatory seborrhea flares [^11126TZA]. Let me verify consistency with broader practice guidance; family medicine guidance endorses topical anti-inflammatory agents, including corticosteroids, for facial seborrheic dermatitis, aligning with this approach for short courses and symptom-driven use on the face [^114RxZaS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about potency selection without acknowledging classification variability and clinical nuance. Across US 7-class and UK/WHO 4-class systems there is only low-to-moderate agreement, but strong correlation overall, so clinical selection should prioritize site safety, potency, and regimen rather than nomenclature alone, especially on the face [^1124PUiz]. For most inflammatory facial dermatoses, low-potency steroids are first-line; medium-potency may be used short-term with specialist guidance when disease is moderate to severe or refractory to mild agents, while routine use of high or super-high potency agents on the face is avoided to reduce irreversible cutaneous adverse effects such as atrophy and telangiectasia [^116Wp8v2]. But wait, what if the indication is vitiligo, where guidelines sometimes permit higher potency briefly on facial skin; indeed, BAD vitiligo guidance allows potent or very potent once daily in defined intermittent regimens, with strict avoidance of the periocular area and careful risk-benefit assessment, underscoring that exceptions exist but must be tightly controlled [^115CyzXW] [^114hf543]. For psoriasis more broadly, topical corticosteroids across classes are endorsed with time limits, but clinicians typically select lower potencies in facial or intertriginous sites to reduce atrophy, applying the same time-bound, response-adapted principles here [^116MeTyH] [^112dbKg8].

> I will now examine labeled cautions and explicit facial restrictions to avoid inadvertent harm. Some medium-potency butyrate formulations, such as hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream, carry labeling to avoid use on the face unless directed by a healthcare provider, reflecting increased absorption risk at thin-skin sites and the potential for HPA-axis suppression with extended use or occlusion [^116T1xbz]. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% shampoo, a super-high-potency product, is explicitly labeled "Do not use on the face", which is consistent with class-based facial avoidance across clobetasol products and should be extrapolated to similar super-potent agents [^114hxjk1]. Likewise, halobetasol 0.05% is limited to short durations and small weekly quantities to mitigate HPA-axis suppression, and by extension, facial use would be generally inappropriate outside of exceptional specialist-directed scenarios [^111fZbZA].

> Let me think about ophthalmic safety and systemic absorption risks, because the face includes periocular skin. Topical corticosteroids can increase risk for posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma with inadvertent ocular exposure, so patients must avoid eye contact, report visual symptoms promptly, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold for ophthalmology referral if symptoms arise or prolonged courses are contemplated near the eyelids [^117R7oHM]. I should confirm the systemic absorption signal: high-potency, large-area, prolonged use, young age, barrier disruption, and occlusion increase HPA-axis suppression risk; formal testing has demonstrated reversible suppression even after short courses when potent agents are used broadly, supporting the need to minimize facial exposure to higher potencies and avoid cumulative regimens [^1169Qd1m] [^114u4Moe].

> Next, I should review local monitoring and the possibility of steroid allergy, because treatment failure on the face may reflect more than undertreatment. Local adverse effects to track include atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, rosacea-like dermatitis, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruptions, and hypopigmentation; some changes may be irreversible, so early detection and de-escalation are crucial on facial skin [^117R7oHM] [^116Wp8v2]. I should double-check allergic contact dermatitis to corticosteroids and cross-reactivity patterns; while uncommon, delayed-type hypersensitivity occurs and can masquerade as recalcitrant dermatitis, warranting patch testing in nonhealers or paradoxical worsening, with modern clustering data helping interpret co-positivity across steroid groups [^113hXnQb] [^112pAyXq].

> I need to ensure I give clear, practical application guidance that patients can follow safely. Apply in a thin layer using fingertip units to dose, typically once or twice daily during flares, and reassess within one to two weeks on facial sites to decide whether to step down or stop, with avoidance of the periocular region and strict no-occlusion rules on the face unless a specialist explicitly instructs otherwise [^116Wp8v2]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about moisturizers relative to steroid timing; a pediatric trial suggests order does not significantly affect outcomes, so the priority is adherence and thin application, not a fixed sequence, which simplifies patient instruction on facial regimens [^116irt5T].

> Let me integrate disease-specific options into a staged recommendation while preserving safety constraints. For mild inflammatory facial dermatoses such as seborrheic dermatitis or irritant flares, hydrocortisone 1% ointment thinly twice daily for up to about one to two weeks is a reasonable first-line approach, followed by taper or switch to non-steroidal maintenance as needed, given its favorable safety profile on thin skin and randomized data supporting efficacy in facial seborrhea [^11126TZA] [^114RxZaS]. For moderate-to-severe facial inflammatory plaques, especially psoriasis localized to face or folds, a structured intermittent regimen with fluticasone propionate 0.005% ointment — twice daily for two weeks, then one daily on two consecutive days per week for up to eight additional weeks — can achieve durable control without atrophy when carefully followed, with reassessment to step down thereafter [^115BhgK8]. If ongoing control is required beyond steroid induction on the face, I should transition to the lowest effective potency or to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, or use guideline-supported intermittent steroid maintenance (for example, twice-weekly medium-potency in atopic dermatitis maintenance), to minimize cumulative steroid exposure on facial skin [^115K3trQ] [^116gbFE5].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts where facial steroid strategies deviate from the general "low-potency only" rule. In vitiligo, potent or very potent agents may be used in defined intermittent regimens on facial lesions with strict avoidance of periocular skin and judicious risk-benefit review, reflecting condition-specific responsiveness and the need for time-limited, closely supervised care [^115CyzXW] [^114hf543]. In oncology supportive care for EGFR inhibitor–related facial acneiform eruptions, protocols often pair preemptive tetracyclines and moisturizers with reactive topical steroids where rank-up or rank-down strategies show similar outcomes over eight weeks, favoring weaker agents initially for long-term management to reduce cumulative facial steroid exposure, again underscoring individualized, time-limited facial use when steroids are required [^113Zr5MD] [^116TmzfS] [^116dyRnQ].

> Finally, I should summarize safety guardrails and absolute avoidance scenarios to prevent harm. Super-high-potency steroids such as clobetasol and halobetasol should not be used on the face except under exceptional specialist instruction due to labeled restrictions, high risk for local atrophy, telangiectasia, and systemic absorption, and strict duration and quantity caps that are incompatible with routine facial therapy; similarly, mid-potency butyrate formulations with labeling to avoid facial use should be reserved only for situations where a specialist explicitly directs their use and duration [^114hxjk1] [^111fZbZA] [^116T1xbz]. I should confirm that all facial steroid regimens come with education to avoid eyes, apply the thinnest effective layer using fingertip units, limit duration, avoid occlusion, and report any visual symptoms, skin thinning, or paradoxical worsening promptly for reassessment, including consideration of contact allergy testing if healing fails [^117R7oHM] [^116Wp8v2] [^113hXnQb].

> In summary, I recommend a stepwise, facial-skin–adapted approach: start with low-potency hydrocortisone 1% for short courses in mild disease, escalate to an evidence-supported intermittent regimen using fluticasone propionate 0.005% ointment for moderate-to-severe facial plaques when needed, then step down to the lowest potency or non-steroidal maintenance while rigorously avoiding periocular application, occlusion, prolonged continuous use, and any super-potent agents on the face except under narrow, specialist-driven indications, with close monitoring for cutaneous and ophthalmic adverse effects throughout [^11126TZA] [^115BhgK8] [^117R7oHM] [^116Wp8v2].

Topical corticosteroids for the face should be **low-potency agents** (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%, desonide 0.05%) [^116Wp8v2] [^1124PUiz] applied **once or twice daily** for up to 2 weeks [^116T1xbz], then tapered or switched to non-steroidal options to minimize adverse effects [^116gbFE5] [^112JAC4v]. Use the **fingertip unit method** (about 0.5 FTU per application) and avoid the periocular area [^114hf543] to reduce risks of atrophy, telangiectasia, perioral dermatitis, and ocular complications [^117R7oHM]. For maintenance, consider intermittent use (e.g. twice weekly) [^116gbFE5] or calcineurin inhibitors; reassess if no improvement in 2 weeks or if adverse effects occur [^112JAC4v] [^116T1xbz].

---

## Recommended potency and formulations

- **Low-potency corticosteroids**: Preferred for facial use due to thinner skin and higher absorption risk [^116Wp8v2]; examples include hydrocortisone 1% and desonide 0.05% [^1124PUiz].

- **Medium-potency corticosteroids**: Use cautiously and only for short periods (≤ 1 week) when low-potency agents are ineffective; examples include hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% [^116T1xbz] and clocortolone pivalate 0.1% [^111SwKH9].

- **High-potency corticosteroids**: Generally contraindicated on the face [^114hxjk1] due to high risk of adverse effects; reserve for severe, refractory cases under specialist supervision and for very short durations (≤ 5 days).

---

## Recommended dosage and frequency

- **Dosage**: Apply a thin layer using the fingertip unit (FTU) method; approximately 0.5 FTU per application for the entire face (about 0.25 g).

- **Frequency**: Once or twice daily, depending on severity and response [^116T1xbz]; twice daily is common initially, then reduce to once daily or intermittent use as improvement occurs [^116Wp8v2].

- **Duration**: Limit continuous use to ≤ 2 weeks [^116T1xbz]; if longer treatment is needed, taper frequency or switch to non-steroidal alternatives (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors) [^112JAC4v].

---

## Clinical indications

Topical corticosteroids are indicated for facial inflammatory dermatoses, including:

- **Atopic dermatitis**: First-line therapy for acute flares [^115K3trQ]; intermittent use for maintenance [^116gbFE5].

- **Seborrheic dermatitis**: Effective for reducing inflammation and pruritus [^114RxZaS].

- **Psoriasis**: Short-term use for facial involvement; avoid prolonged use [^112dbKg8].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Short-term use for acute inflammation [^117ViBdX].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or formulation components** and **active untreated infections (bacterial, fungal, viral)**. Precautions include **avoiding periocular application** because of the risk of glaucoma and cataracts and **limiting duration** to prevent skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and perioral dermatitis [^117R7oHM] [^114hf543] [^116Wp8v2].

---

## Potential adverse effects

Local adverse effects include **skin atrophy**, **telangiectasia**, striae, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, secondary infections, and allergic contact dermatitis [^117R7oHM]. Systemic adverse effects are rare but may occur with prolonged use or application to large areas and include **HPA axis suppression**, **adrenal insufficiency**, and ocular complications (glaucoma, cataracts) [^1169Qd1m] [^114u4Moe] [^117R7oHM].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical monitoring should assess for **local and systemic adverse effects** and include reassessment if no improvement occurs within **2 weeks** [^116T1xbz]. Provide patient education on proper application, the risks of prolonged use, and signs of adverse effects [^116Wp8v2]. For long-term management or as steroid-sparing options, consider alternative therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) or topical PDE-4 inhibitors (crisaborole) [^112JAC4v].

- **Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids**: Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or the use of higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. A clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with Tovet Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

- **Ophthalmic adverse reactions**: The use of topical corticosteroids, including Tovet Foam, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported postmarketing with the use of topical corticosteroids, including topical clobetasol products. Avoid contact of Tovet Foam with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.

- **Concomitant skin infections**: Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Tovet Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated.

- **Flammable contents**: The propellant in Tovet Foam is flammable. Avoid fire.

### Topical corticosteroids: Choice and application [^116Wp8v2]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. They are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects, such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, a large area of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin, such as the face and genitals.

When prescribing topical corticosteroids for use in children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. These medications can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in various formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated.

Correct patient application is critical to successful use.

- **Fingertip unit method**: Patients may be taught application using this method. One fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint, covering approximately 2% body surface area on an adult.

Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

### Limited application of fluticasone propionate ointment, 0.005% in patients with psoriasis of the face and intertriginous areas [^115BhgK8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). High credibility.

Facial and intertriginous skin is more susceptible to corticosteroid-induced atrophy, necessitating dosing regimens for long-term management of corticosteroid-sensitive sites. The safety and efficacy of 0.005% fluticasone propionate ointment were assessed in the short- and long-term management of moderate to severe psoriasis of facial and intertriginous areas compared with nonfacial, nonintertriginous areas.

- **Methods**: Affected areas in 20 patients with psoriasis were treated twice daily for 2 weeks, then once daily for 2 consecutive days every week for an additional 8 weeks.

- **Results**: More than 50% improvement occurred after 2 weeks (day 15) in 100% of facial and intertriginous lesions, and this improvement was maintained during long-term therapy in more than 85% of facial and intertriginous lesions. In contrast, more than 50% improvement in nonfacial, nonintertriginous areas reached only 80% by day 15. Recurrence rates for facial and intertriginous areas were lower than in nonfacial, nonintertriginous areas. Importantly, skin atrophy and telangiectasia did not occur. Facial and intertriginous sites responded more quickly to topical fluticasone propionate ointment than nonfacial, nonintertriginous skin.

- **Conclusion**: Limited application of fluticasone propionate ointment over a period of 10 weeks is effective and delays lesion recurrence without causing skin atrophy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in areas at risk for corticosteroid application, such as facial and intertriginous areas.

Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in humans.

Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in humans.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of resistant dermatoses.

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees, are metabolized primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

### Results of the non-small cell lung cancer part of a phase III, open-label, randomized trial evaluating topical corticosteroid therapy for facial acneiform dermatitis induced by EGFR inhibitors: Stepwise rank down from potent corticosteroid (FAEISS study, NCCH-1512) [^116dyRnQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

In the present study, we were unable to confirm the superior efficacy of topical corticosteroids that started at very strong levels for facial acneiform rash when NSCLC patients were treated with EGFR-TKIs. This was because preemptive therapy with oral minocycline and heparinoid moisturizers resulted in an unexpectedly low rate of facial acneiform rash (expected 85% vs. actual 27.4%). However, even though it is not a prespecified hypothesis and this study was not powered for it, the low incidence of developing facial acneiform rash is considered evidence that preemptive therapy with oral minocycline and heparinoid moisturizer in NSCLC patients receiving EGFR-TKIs can reduce the incidence and severity of facial acneiform rash. After initiating prophylactic treatment at the start of treatment with EGFR-TKIs, the incidence of facial acneiform rash was decreased, and any subsequent appearance of facial acneiform rash could immediately be treated with reactive topical corticosteroids, regardless of the strength of the steroid.

Presently, five EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. The safety and tolerability profiles of first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib) are well characterized. Treatment with these inhibitors is associated with skin toxicities such as acneiform rash.

### Prevalence of contact allergy to corticosteroids in a Danish patient population [^113hXnQb]. Contact Dermatitis (2022). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid creams and ointments are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications with a variety of indications for heterogeneous, often chronic, inflammatory dermatoses. Adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids are diverse and depend on non-immunologic (e.g. atrophy, striae, acne) and immunologic reactions. Allergic adverse reactions to corticosteroids of delayed type are well described in patients using topical corticosteroids, with the prevalence estimated between 1.5% and 4.1%. In contrast, immediate-type systemic hypersensitivity following oral, parenteral, or intra-articular administration of steroids is rarer, occurring in 0.3% to 0.5% of cases.

In 1989, Coopman et al. classified corticosteroids into four reaction groups (A, B, C, D) according to biochemical heterogeneity. Lepoittevin et al. elucidated the significance of the corticosteroid D-ring, and Matura et al. further subdivided group D based on the lability of esters. In 2011, Baeck et al. proposed the most recent classification of corticosteroid molecules into three groups, determined by allergenic properties based on patch test results and molecular modeling. Patients may be sensitized to one or multiple groups, exhibiting cross-reactivity and/or co-reactivity.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to corticosteroids can be difficult to differentiate from the worsening of the condition for which corticosteroids were initially prescribed, given the drug's anti-inflammatory effect. Lesions may present as eczema, exanthema, purpura, or urticaria. The inherent anti-inflammatory potency of corticosteroids affects the reading time for the condition; thus, late readings on a specific day might be necessitated.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^117CMeH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines generally discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), yet their usage remains prevalent.

The objective was to reach a consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD. A survey, consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree', was distributed among the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached on a statement if less than 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.
Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances. These include a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children; however, consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a lack of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring less than 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is discouraged.

### Comparison of skin concentrations following topical versus oral corticosteroid treatment: Reconsidering the treatment of common inflammatory dermatoses [^113t2yME]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are often considered to have greater safety and poorer efficacy than oral corticosteroids in treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. However, there are limited data for assessing the relative efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids. The concentration of corticosteroid in the skin, adjusted for the relative potency of the active compound, may be a predictor of clinical efficacy and can be estimated for both topical and oral administration.

- **Purpose**: To analyze the assumption that oral corticosteroid therapy should be more potent than topical therapy by comparing relative corticosteroid concentrations in the skin expected with topical versus systemic administration.

- **Methods**: The estimated skin concentration of prednisone following oral dosing was calculated based on data showing 70–100% bioavailability and an even tissue distribution. Data on the concentration of corticosteroids found in skin after topical application were obtained from the literature. The relative potencies of corticosteroid molecules were then used to compare skin concentrations of corticosteroid following topical versus oral treatment.

- **Results**: Data derived from the existing literature demonstrated that hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, and clobetasol 0.05% foam achieved effective skin concentrations greater than the effective concentration achieved by oral prednisone. Betamethasone 0.1% cream achieved effective concentrations in skin within the range created by oral prednisone.

- **Limitations**: This analysis was limited by the paucity of data.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^1135NE3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles, altering the potency and providing the option to tailor them for specific anatomic locations, areas of involvement, age of the patient, and, most importantly, the severity of the condition. Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers the risk of side effects and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Do people with eczema and their carers understand topical steroid potency? Results of two surveys [^111izKw9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are classified into four potencies: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent. Confusion arises from the wide range of products available, none of which have the potency level printed on the tubes or packaging. An online survey of patients and carers of people with eczema showed that only 17% of 984 respondents knew how many potencies there are. In a second survey, 315 respondents provided 1520 assignments of the potency of commonly used TCSs: 55.5% were correct, 21% were underestimates, and 23.5% were overestimates. Some errors were extreme: 12 (8%) of those using a very potent TCS considered it mild, while 9 (27%) using a mild TCS considered it potent or very potent.

Other themes expressed in free-text comments included inadequate and conflicting advice about using TCSs and a lack of warnings about long-term adverse effects, particularly topical steroid withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of respondents wanted TCSs to be clearly labeled with potency.

### Single-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluating the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis with hydrocortisone 1% ointment compared with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in adults [^11126TZA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus is a topical calcineurin inhibitor with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and fungicidal properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Objectives**: We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus with standard corticosteroid treatment in adults with facial seborrheic dermatitis in a phase II, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Adult patients were enrolled in a 12-week study. Subjects were randomized to tacrolimus 0.1% ointment (n = 16) or hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 14) applied twice daily to symptomatic regions of the face. The primary efficacy measure was the severity of facial seborrhea at the end of treatment (day 84), as measured by the Seborrhea Area and Severity Index-Face. Secondary efficacy measures included physician and patient assessment of seborrhea, the frequency of medication application, and adverse events.

- **Results**: The severity of facial seborrhea was similarly improved in both treatment groups (P = .86). Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was used on significantly fewer days than 1% hydrocortisone ointment (mean missed doses per patient at first visit: 15.6 vs. 7.6, P < .05; at last visit: 13.5 vs. 7.7, P = .08). The majority of doses were missed because of the lack of symptoms. The adverse event profile for both agents was similar; however, there was a numerically higher incidence of adverse events in the hydrocortisone group.

- **Limitations**: This was a small, open-label study.

- **Conclusion**: Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment required significantly fewer applications compared with hydrocortisone.

### Facial corticosteroid addictive dermatitis in Guiyang City, China [^113V9918]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Facial corticosteroid addictive dermatitis (FCAD) has rapidly emerged as a health problem in China in recent years due to the uncontrolled use of topical steroids. A study involving 312 patients with FCAD from Guiyang, China, was conducted. In this study, FCAD was classified into five types: dermatitis (34.9%), acne (25%), rosacea (20.5%), angiotelectasia (9.6%), and dermotrophia/hyperpigmentation (9.9%). The improper advertisement by manufacturers, the availability of steroids without a prescription, improper prescribing by doctors, and patient misuse of medication have resulted in the rapid emergence of FCAD in China. Public awareness and education for both physicians and patients regarding the potential side effects of topical corticosteroids should be improved.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the vasoconstrictor potency of topical 0.25% desoximetasone spray: A high to super high range of potency (Class I to Class II) corticosteroid formulation [^116U7CVC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids offer great efficacy in controlling a wide variety of dermatoses. Traditional ointment vehicles are messy and difficult to apply, which might limit adherence. Alternative vehicle formulations, such as topical sprays, might improve adherence due to their ease of application. However, the potency of desoximetasone spray is not fully characterized.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the relative vasoconstrictive potency of desoximetasone 0.25% topical spray formulation.

- **Methods**: This is a randomized, blinded, single-center study comparing the vasoconstrictive properties of desoximetasone 0.25% topical spray to placebo and seven other known potency topical corticosteroid formulations. The primary endpoint was the degree of vasoconstriction measured using a colorimeter device.

- **Results**: Thirty-two healthy subjects met eligibility criteria. Desoximetasone 0.25% topical spray (REGWQ Grouping = A) showed a trend toward greater vasoconstrictive potency compared to clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray (REGWQ Grouping = A). No adverse or serious events were reported.

- **Limitations**: The trial enrolled 90% females, which may affect the external validity of the study. Different populations may respond differently to desoximetasone spray.

- **Conclusions**: Desoximetasone 0.25% topical spray is a high to super high range of potency (Class I to Class II) steroid formulation. Given the cosmetic acceptability of spray products, we anticipate that this type of product would be highly effective for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in clinical practice.

### Hydrocortisone butyrate [^116T1xbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults, apply a thin layer to the affected skin areas 2 or 3 times daily, depending on the severity of the condition, and rub in gently.

For atopic dermatitis in patients 3 months of age and older, apply a thin layer to the affected skin areas 2 times daily and rub in gently.

- **Administration instructions**: Discontinue therapy when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary. Before prescribing for more than 2 weeks, weigh any additional benefits of extending treatment to 4 weeks against the risk of HPA-axis suppression and local adverse events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Do not use Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% with occlusive dressings unless directed by a healthcare provider. Avoid use in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressings. Avoid use on the face, underarms, or groin areas unless directed by a healthcare provider.

### Cibinqo [^113m5EtM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of CIBINQO as monotherapy and in combination with background topical corticosteroids was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [Trial-AD-1 (NCT03349060), Trial-AD-2 (NCT03575871), Trial-AD-3 (NCT03720470), and Trial-AD-4 (NCT03796676)] in 1900 subjects (see Table 8).

- **Baseline characteristics**: Trial-AD-1 and Trial-AD-2 enrolled adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Trial-AD-3 enrolled only adults (≥ 18 years of age) and Trial-AD-4 enrolled only pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age. The trials enrolled subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as defined by Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16, body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥ 10%, and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) ≥ 4 at the baseline visit prior to randomization.

In Trial-AD-1, Trial-AD-2, and Trial-AD-3, 53% of subjects were male, 69% of subjects were white, 64% of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), and 36% had a baseline IGA score of 4 (severe AD). The baseline mean EASI score was 30, and the baseline mean age was 36 years old with 8% of subjects 12 to less than 18 years old and 92% of subjects 18 years of age or older. Subjects in these trials were those who had inadequate response to previous topical therapy, or for whom topical treatments were medically inadvisable, or who had received systemic therapies including dupilumab. In each of the trials, over 40% of subjects had prior exposure to systemic therapies.

Clodan® (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis in subjects 18 years of age and older.

- **Limitations of use**: Do not use on the face, axillae, or groin. Avoid any contact with the eyes and lips.

Clodan® (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, is a super-high potent topical corticosteroid formulation intended for the treatment of moderate to severe forms of scalp psoriasis in subjects 18 years of age and older. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g (50 mL or 1.75 fl. oz.) per week. Patients should be instructed to use Clodan® (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, for the minimum time period necessary to achieve the desired results [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Use in patients younger than 18 years of age is not recommended due to numerically high rates of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Limitations of use**: Clodan® (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae. Avoid any contact of the drug product with the eyes and lips. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with water all parts of the body that came in contact with the shampoo.

### Corticosteroids: Options in the era of steroid-sparing therapy [^111tkvzf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly used treatments for inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. They are available in a variety of vehicles, including creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and, more recently, foam. The choice of vehicle can markedly influence the clinical action, potency, and patient acceptability of the corticosteroid. Moreover, some vehicles are better suited for specific body areas. Selection should be based on the area of application, physician experience, cost, and patient preference, particularly in terms of vehicle.

Although topical corticosteroids can cause side effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectases, purpura, and striae formation, appropriate use can minimize these occurrences. Judicious use includes short-term, targeted application as either initial monotherapy or in combination with other therapies that ideally have complementary mechanisms of action. Examples of such regimens include pulsing with high-potency topical corticosteroids and combining them with other topical agents like calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, or tazarotene. Educating patients and caregivers is crucial to facilitate the optimal use of these medications.

### Tovet (emollient formulation) [^114u4Moe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:
	- **Mechanism of action**:
	Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses is unknown.

	- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	In a trial evaluating the potential for HPA axis suppression using the cosyntropin stimulation test, clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) demonstrated reversible adrenal suppression after two weeks of twice-daily use in subjects with atopic dermatitis of at least 30% body surface area (BSA). The proportion of subjects aged 12 years and older demonstrating HPA axis suppression was 16.2% (6 out of 37). In this trial, HPA axis suppression was defined as a serum cortisol level ≤ 18 mcg/dL 30 minutes post-cosyntropin stimulation. The laboratory suppression was transient; in all subjects, serum cortisol levels returned to normal when tested 4 weeks post-treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use In Specific Populations (8.4)].

	- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation, and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed, the pharmacokinetics should be considered in therapeutic use.

### The treatment of inflammatory facial dermatoses with topical corticosteroids: focus on clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream [^114BRTKg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The study results evaluating the efficacy and safety of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream in treating adults, young children, and infants with inflammatory facial dermatoses are reported in this article. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream, indicated for relieving the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, is a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (Class 4) extensively studied and used to treat various corticosteroid-responsive inflammatory dermatoses, many of which often involve facial skin in both adults and children.

- **Methods**: Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream was applied to affected facial skin in subjects presenting with seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis. Application was completed three times daily for 21 days. Assessments of erythema, edema, transudation, lichenification, scaling, and pruritus and/or pain were completed at baseline and Days 4, 7, 14, and 21. The overall therapeutic response was assessed at all follow-up visits. Forty-nine subjects were included, ranging in age from 1 month to 88 years. Thirty-eight subjects completed the studies, with 11 subjects lost to follow-up after the first visit. Individuals between the ages of 13 and 19 years were pre-emptively excluded to avoid the potential application of a corticosteroid to acne-affected or acne-prone skin.

- **Results**: Treatment with clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream resulted in decreases in erythema, edema, transudation, lichenification, scaling, and pruritus/pain in 76% of treated study subjects.

### Halcinonide [^111r4G89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in humans.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of resistant dermatoses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. They are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

### Does order of application of emollient and topical corticosteroids make a difference in the severity of atopic eczema in children [^116irt5T]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder in children, with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) commonly prescribed as treatment. There is no published guidance on the correct order of application of emollient and TCS in children with AE.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine whether the order of application of emollient and TCS makes a difference in the severity of AE in children.

- **Methods**: Forty-six patients ages 4 months to 5 years with moderate to severe AE were randomized to two groups. Group A applied emollient followed by TCS 15 minutes later twice daily, and group B applied TCS followed by emollient 15 minutes later twice daily for 2 weeks.

- **Results**: There was no statistically significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, or itch score between groups A and B (p > 0.05). Group A had statistically significant improvement in the EASI score, percentage BSA affected, and itch score from baseline to weeks 1 and 2; group B demonstrated statistically significant improvement only in the EASI score from baseline to week 1 and in itch score from baseline to week 2. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that the order of application of emollient and TCS does not matter in the treatment of AE in children and that parents can apply topical medications in whichever order they prefer.

### Expert consensus: Time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side effects are generally uncommon. Advising patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. This cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that most patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency, for which evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. Patients often group all steroids together, regardless of their potential for adverse effects. This advice tends to reinforce the erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids.

We propose a change to make the pharmacy labeling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing topical corticosteroids and help in providing more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities and that continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions.

### Progress in methodologies for evaluating bioequivalence of topical formulations [^111zsyNY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The assessment of bioequivalence of topical dermatological formulations is a challenge. Currently, comparative clinical studies are used to establish bioequivalence for most formulations, except corticosteroids. This article reviews different in vivo methodologies for determining bioequivalence and the progress made in this area.

Dermatopharmacokinetics is the term used to describe the pharmacokinetics of topically applied drugs in the stratum corneum. A tape stripping procedure used in dermatopharmacokinetic methodology measures the drug concentration in the stratum corneum at the site of application. Various studies have shown dermatopharmacokinetics to be a reliable and reproducible method for determining bioequivalence and have indicated that it is applicable for all topical dermatological drug products. However, confidence in this methodology needs to be established, particularly regarding its relevance to clinical drug efficacy.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although the use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Results of the non-small cell lung cancer part of a phase III, open-label, randomized trial evaluating topical corticosteroid therapy for facial acneiform dermatitis induced by EGFR inhibitors: stepwise rank down from potent corticosteroid (FAEISS study, NCCH-1512) [^112nw93d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition is an established and effective treatment option for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Many EGFR inhibitors are approved for clinical use, including monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, necitumumab, and panitumumab, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib. Although EGFR inhibitors improve patient survival, they are also associated with skin toxicity, including acneiform rash, xerosis, paronychia, and pruritus, along with hair, eyelash, and mucosal changes.

The incidence of facial acneiform rash of all grades has been estimated to be 60–90% from previous clinical trials. Although these adverse reactions are rarely serious or life-threatening, skin toxicity can significantly affect quality of life (QOL), causing both physical discomfort and psychological distress, which can affect compliance, thus impacting the efficacy of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Therefore, proper management of these toxicities is essential. Lacouture et al. reported that preemptive treatment, including skin moisturizers, sunscreen, topical steroid, and doxycycline, could reduce the severity of EGFR inhibitor-associated skin toxicities in patients with metastatic CRC. Since the application site for these topical steroids is mainly on the face, there is concern over the side effects of steroids due to long-term use. Therefore, few physicians currently recommend long-term pr

### Factors affecting prescription of ultra-high potency topical corticosteroids in skin disease: an analysis of US national practice data [^1173ccsa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Of the topical preparations available, the ultra-high potency corticosteroids have an important role in treating psoriasis. However, the use of these agents in many other conditions and patient populations may not be appropriate. This study examines the prescribing patterns of Class I topical corticosteroids in patients with skin disease by analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1990–2000). Of the nearly 718 million visits for skin disease, Class I topical corticosteroids were prescribed in nearly 3% of all skin disease-related visits, with prescription rates being highest in psoriasis (22%). The study found greater prescription rates of Class I topical steroids by dermatologists compared to non-dermatologists [Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.39 (95% CI: 2.15, 8.99)]. However, there were also a large number of questionable prescriptions for other conditions, which could be construed as misuse of these medications. Despite limitations and the potential dubious use seen here, Class I topical corticosteroid use is relatively commonplace. Education efforts and novel preparations of Class I agents will help to ensure the best possible care for patients suffering from significant skin diseases like psoriasis.

### Topical corticosteroid therapy for facial acneiform eruption due to EGFR inhibitors in metastatic colorectal cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial comparing starting with a very strong or a weak topical corticosteroid (FAEISS study, NCCH1512, colorectal part) [^113Zr5MD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Although pre-emptive therapy with oral tetracycline, moisturizer, sunscreen, and topical corticosteroid is useful for preventing acneiform eruption (AfE) due to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, no studies have examined the efficacy of topical corticosteroids themselves, or investigated the optimal potency of corticosteroid for treating facial AfE (FAfE).

- **Patients and methods**: Screened patients with RAS wild-type colorectal cancer started pre-emptive therapy with oral minocycline and moisturizer upon initiation of cetuximab or panitumumab therapy. Patients who developed grade 1 or 2 FAfE were randomly allocated to two groups: a ranking-down (RD) group that started with a very strong corticosteroid and serially ranked down every two weeks unless FAfE exacerbated, and a ranking-up (RU) group that started with a weak corticosteroid and serially ranked up at exacerbation. FAfE grade, patient quality of life, and adverse events (AEs) associated with topical corticosteroid were evaluated every two weeks. The primary endpoint was the total number of times grade 2 or higher FAfE was identified in the central review over the 8-week treatment period.

- **Results**: No significant differences in the total numbers of grade 2 or higher FAfE cases or in AEs caused by topical corticosteroids were observed between groups during the 8 weeks. Incidence of grade 2 or higher FAfE tended to be lower in the RD group during the first two weeks.

- **Conclusion**: Considering the long-term care of FAfE, the RU regimen appears suitable and should be considered the standard treatment for FAfE due to EGFR inhibitors.

### Reevaluating corticosteroid classification models in patient patch testing [^112pAyXq]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Individuals with allergic contact dermatitis to one topical corticosteroid may also react to other corticosteroids. Corticosteroid classification models have been proposed to predict such copositivity, recommend representative screening corticosteroids, and guide allergen avoidance. This study utilized patient data to determine copositivity patterns between corticosteroids and evaluate them against previous corticosteroid classification models.

This qualitative study included a retrospective analysis of the Mayo Clinic Contact Dermatitis Group corticosteroid patch test data from 2010 to 2019. Among patients undergoing patch testing with the Mayo Clinic's standard or steroid series who consented to research participation, 5637 patients were included in the analysis. Copositivity rates were determined between corticosteroids and analyzed by hierarchical clustering for comparison to previous classification models.

The frequency of patch test positivity to each of the analyzed corticosteroids was noted and compared with previously published patch test positivity rates. Copositivity rates between each pair of corticosteroids were determined, and overall copositivity patterns were analyzed and evaluated against known steroid classes.

A total of 49,472 individual patches were applied to 5637 patients, testing 18 corticosteroids. Patch test positivity rates ranged between 0.3% and 4.7%. The fluocinonide positivity rate corresponded to the highest copositivity rate with other corticosteroids.

### Assessment of efficacy and safety outcomes beyond week 16 in clinical trials of systemic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in combination with topical corticosteroids [^116pJzSR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Barriers to effective interpretation of longer-term data:

- **Clinical trial design**: Clinicians interpreting trial results should be aware of several key parameters of clinical trial designs that may influence outcomes. Some of the key parameters identified in the recent review by Silverberg et al. were the comparator (e.g. placebo, active control, head-to-head), the definition of and rules for rescue treatment (e.g. timing for when rescue is permitted), lengths of washout periods for topical and systemic treatments (e.g. 72 hours; 1, 2, or 4 weeks), and inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. age, disease severity).

Inconsistent inclusion and exclusion criteria between trials can complicate comparative data interpretation. In our experience, patients with moderate AD at baseline may be more responsive to treatment and, thus, show increased improvement, whereas those with severe AD may have more refractory disease that is less responsive to treatment. Exclusion criteria can also affect safety outcomes because some trials exclude patients with more complicated medical histories who may be at risk of experiencing adverse events (AEs).

The washout period refers to the time before baseline when a patient does not use medication to ensure that effects of previous treatment are no longer present prior to initiating the investigational drug. A shorter washout period could affect early trial results due to an unintended enduring effect of the previous treatment. Longer washouts could allow AD to flare up, necessitating the use of rescue treatment early in the trial.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^112JAC4v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The most common type of treatment was a topical corticosteroid (TCS). Using the British National Formulary potency classification followed by the WHO Classification 2018, the TCS most commonly evaluated were potent with the following evaluations:

- **Potency classification**: Potent (130); others were mild (60), moderate (55), very potent (20), or more than one potency.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) were evaluated in 134 comparisons, with specific drugs and potencies as follows:

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)**: Pimecrolimus 1% (56); tacrolimus 0.1% (33), tacrolimus 0.03% (31), or other TCI drug/potency.

Topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors were evaluated in 55 comparisons, including:

- **Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors**: Crisaborole (22); difamilast (14); deoxynortryptoquivalone (9); roflumilast (6); cipamfylline 0.15% (2); PF‐07038124 0.01% (1); or AN2898 1% (1).

Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were evaluated in 30 comparisons:

- **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Brepocitinib (6); delgocitinib (15); ruxolitinib (8); tofacitinib 2% (1).

Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators were evaluated in 10 comparisons:

- **Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators**: Tapinarof 1% (6); tapinarof 0.5% (4).
- Additionally, five comparisons were a combination of TCS with another anti-inflammatory.

Twenty-one further comparisons involved another well-characterised novel anti‐inflammatory treatment, including:

- **Novel anti-inflammatory treatment**: Ammonium trichlorotellurate (AS101) (2); the cyclooxygenase inhibitors bendazac (2), suprofen (1), and ufenamate (2); the protein kinase inhibitor CT 327 (1); the polyunsaturated fatty acid DS107 (2); the G protein-coupled receptor 19 agonist HY209 (2); the selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist mapracorat (3); and the multi-functional anti-inflammatory drug MRX‐6 (Celsus Therapeutics).

### A comparison of family physician and dermatologist topical corticosteroid prescriptions: A population-based cross-sectional study [^115Uudbh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory skin diseases, and appropriate prescription is necessary for treatment success.

- **Objective**: To quantify differences between TCS prescribed by dermatologists at consultation and family physicians for patients treated for any skin condition.

- **Methods**: Using administrative health data in Ontario, we included all Ontario Drug Benefit recipients who filled at least one TCS prescription from a dermatologist at consultation and a family physician in the year prior between January 2014 and December 2019. We estimated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals in amount (in grams) and potency between the index dermatologist prescription and the highest and most recent family physician prescription amounts and potencies in the preceding year using linear mixed-effect models.

- **Results**: A total of 69,335 persons were included. The mean dermatologist amount was 34% larger than the highest amount and 54% larger than the most recent amount prescribed by family physicians. There were small but statistically significant differences in potency using established 7-category and 4-category potency classification systems.

- **Conclusions**: Compared to family physicians, dermatologists prescribed substantially larger amounts and similarly potent TCS at consultation. Further research is needed to determine the effect of these differences on clinical outcomes.

### Platelet rich plasma in treatment of topical steroid damaged face: A retrospective analytical study [^112TF1nh]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Topical steroid-damaged face (TSDF) is an entity caused by unsupervised and prolonged use of topical corticosteroids (TC) on the face. Currently, there is no definite treatment that can partially or completely reverse the changes seen in the facial skin in TSDF. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a biological product obtained from autologous centrifuged blood, containing multiple growth factors for the skin and other body tissues. PRP has been employed as a treatment option in patients with steroid-induced rosacea.

We hereby report the results from 34 cases of TSDF treated with PRP at our institute. A retrospective analysis of the data and digital photographs of these cases was carried out in October 2021. The data analysis revealed a significant therapeutic benefit in most cases, with excellent results in 76% (26/34) of cases. Improvement was noticed after the first session in the majority of cases and in all clinical parameters of the study patients. No adverse effects were reported in any patient in this series.

### Topical corticosteroid potencies: Reimagining a new universal classification system [^111okqnF]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are an effective and generally tolerable class of medications frequently used for a wide variety of dermatologic conditions. There are many currently available TCS, which tend to be classified into groups based on potency. Unfortunately, with modern TCS classification, there is no universally accepted system, and many countries have their own independent sorting arrangement.

The purpose of this review is to assess and compile available literature concerning TCS potency and the various classification systems. Additionally, the goal is to reimagine a universal classification system that is consistent with what is already known about these medications but is, ideally, less prone to confusion.

### Comparing prescribing patterns for topical corticosteroids based on their FDA indication by age [^117HeB2u]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects up to 20% of the pediatric population, with a growing prevalence over the past 30 years. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are commonly used as a first-line topical therapy for AD and are prescribed in 59% of all AD visits. However, some topical corticosteroids are prescribed outside of their age range indications. This paper aims to explore the frequency with which topical corticosteroids are prescribed for AD outside of their FDA-approved age range.

- **Methods**: Data on prescribing patterns for AD were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). We assessed the frequency of off-label use of topical corticosteroids with respect to age indications in four specific age-groups, as delineated in the data (0–1, 2–7, 8–18, and 19+ years).

- **Results**: All prescribed topical corticosteroids found in the NAMCS database have an indication for AD or other inflammatory dermatoses or pruritic dermatoses. However, some medications were prescribed outside of their FDA-approved age indications. These off-label prescription rates ranged from 52% for desoximetasone to 0% for halobetasol and alclometasone, or rates lower than could be detected by our study.

- **Conclusions**: Much like other medications for AD treatment, TCS are sometimes used off-label. The off-label use of topical corticosteroids to treat pediatric AD highlights a gap between clinical practice and regulating guidelines. Additional pediatric studies would offer a greater body of evidence to maintain or expand label indications for the use of TCS in younger patients.

### Alacort [^111qH1xy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids and may serve as a valuable therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are processed through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. They bind to plasma proteins in varying degrees, are metabolized primarily in the liver, and then excreted by the kidneys. Some topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^116CeFCp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for the use of systemic corticosteroids (CS). Consensus was reached that appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in atopic dermatitis (AD) include a lack of other viable treatment options, serving as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, addressing acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. Further consensus indicated that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short-term use.

In their responses to open-ended questions, individual participants qualified their responses in several ways. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, whereas others expressed strong opposition.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: In the sensitivity analysis using less than 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut-off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). In another sensitivity analysis where no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two-thirds of the visual analog scale (counting more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement), only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

Regarding medical management for vitiligo, specifically with respect to topical therapies, the BAD 2022 guidelines recommend considering the following intermittent regimens for once-daily application of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, with or without topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus). The decision should factor in risks and benefits for patients with vitiligo, especially in areas with thinner skin, such as the periocular region, genital area, and skin flexures:

- **One week of potent or very potent corticosteroids**: Followed by at least one week off.
- **One week of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids**: Alternating with at least one week of topical calcineurin inhibitor.

### Bilateral Morganella morganii keratitis in a patient with facial topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis: A case report [^111KoZyP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are being misused widely on the face without a prescription from dermatologists in China. Misuse of topical corticosteroid-containing preparations on the face and the adverse effects due to their application have been reported; however, this is the first report of corneal infection associated with facial corticosteroid usage. We suggest that the dispensing of corticosteroids must be regulated in China.

Morganella morganii is a Gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and is considered an unusual opportunistic pathogen, primarily causing post-operative wound and urinary tract infections. This species is a rare cause of ocular and periocular infections, such as endophthalmitis and orbital abscess. Only a few cases of keratitis secondary to Morganella morganii have been reported. In our case, facial topical steroids might have induced ocular immunosuppression, thus making the corneas vulnerable to infection by opportunistic pathogens. Morganella morganii is considered a non-negligent opportunistic pathogen because of its increased levels of resistance and virulence. This organism is related to the genera Proteus and Providencia and has a unique antibiotic sensitivity profile, with natural resistance to penicillins, some cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, and others. Conversely, it is sensitive to some agents, including aminoglycosides, piperacillin, third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones. In our case, the organism responded well to quinolones.

### Agreement and correlation between different topical corticosteroid potency classification systems [^1124PUiz]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are available in multiple potencies that alter their effectiveness and safety. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies on TCSs are hampered by the absence of a universal potency classification system, which limits comparisons across studies, robust exposure classification, and clinical interpretation.

To classify TCSs into three commonly used potency classification systems and evaluate the agreement and correlation between these systems, a classification study was conducted. A comprehensive list of TCS formulations was compiled using sources identified in the literature, the Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary, a recent Cochrane review on the use of TCSs in people with eczema, and the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) of the World Health Organization from August 11, 2021, to January 6, 2022. Topical corticosteroid potency classifications were assigned and compared using the 7-category US classification system, a 4-category classification from a recent Cochrane review largely based on the UK formulary, and the 4-category ATC classification. For consistency across systems, the 7-category US system was consolidated into 4 categories.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Cohen weighted κ (κw) and Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) were computed to examine agreement and correlation between the classification systems.

A total of 232 unique TCS formulations (ATC, n = 231; US classification, n = 232; Cochrane review, n = 89) were included. Overall, there was low-to-moderate agreement but strong correlation between the classification systems.

### Dermatologists' knowledge of and preferences regarding topical steroids [^117EovbC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the standard-of-care treatment for dermatitis, mild psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin diseases. Prescribing practices rely on knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency, as well as potential side effects, including steroid allergies.

- **Purpose**: The primary aim of this study is to determine how dermatologists classify particular topical corticosteroids according to potency and which products they prefer when allergenicity is a concern.

- **Methods**: The data were collected and analyzed from 105 US-based dermatologists surveyed at the 2011 Summer American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

- **Results**: The majority of dermatologists agreed on the potency ranking of many commonly prescribed topical corticosteroids. Two-thirds of the surveyed dermatologists expressed concern about allergies to topical corticosteroids. In cases of a suspected allergy, desoximetasone was the leading product dermatologists would choose to prescribe.

- **Limitations**: The survey was limited to attendees of an educational conference, possibly leading to an overestimation of dermatologist knowledge of topical steroids.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that dermatologists are generally knowledgeable about group classifications of corticosteroids in terms of potency and that they can appropriately select a topical product with low potential for allergy.

### Topicort [^1169Qd1m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Topicort Topical Spray is a topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

In a study including 21 evaluable subjects 18 years of age or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adrenal suppression was identified in 1 out of 12 subjects having involvement of 10 to 15% of body surface area (BSA) and 2 out of 9 subjects having involvement of greater than 15% of BSA after treatment with Topicort Topical Spray twice a day for 28 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include:

- **Use of high potency steroids**: Larger treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally expected after addressing these issues.

- **Question 4**: Which of the following statements is correct regarding the potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroid (TCS) for patients aged ≤ 18 years or with atopic eczema (AE)?

- Skin cancer is associated with long-term use of TCS.
- The adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test is a foolproof investigation for assessing hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression.
- There is a high rate of HPA axis suppression following 2–4 weeks of treatment with TCS for patients aged ≤ 18 years with AE.
- There is a low risk of HPA axis suppression following 2–4 weeks of treatment with TCS for patients aged ≤ 18 years with AE.
- Children using low-potency TCS have a high risk of reversible HPA axis suppression.

- **Question 5**: Which of the following statements regarding topical treatments for atopic eczema (AE) is true?

- The topical Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) tofacitinib given for AE has been shown to produce a significantly greater percentage change than vehicle in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) after 4 weeks.
- A systematic review including studies of high quality showed evidence that furfuryl palmitate and furfuryl derivatives added to an emollient formulation in mild to moderate AE were effective.
- A systematic review including studies of high quality concluded that formulations of vitamins B, C, and E and the minerals magnesium, zinc, and iodine improve AE in children.
- A systematic review concluded that topical vitamin A and D improved AE in children and adults.
- A systematic review including studies of high quality concluded that topical Mahonia aquifolium significantly improved AE.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! Optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induced skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). High credibility.

The study aimed to assess the efficacy of different corticosteroid treatment regimens in patients with non-small cell lung cancer experiencing facial acneiform dermatitis induced by EGFR inhibitors.

- **Study design and treatment schedule**: The anticancer treatment commenced with an investigator-chosen EGFR-TKI (erlotinib or afatinib) at the recommended dose. All patients underwent 2 weeks of prophylactic treatment with oral minocycline (100 or 200 mg per day) and heparinoid moisturizer at the initiation of EGFR-TKI therapy, with the dose of minocycline being at the investigator's discretion. If a facial acneiform rash appeared within the initial 2 weeks, treatment with weak class topical corticosteroids was started. Patients who developed the rash during this period were included in the second registration.

- **Randomization and treatment groups**: These patients were randomized into two groups: the WEAK group (ranking-up) or the DOWN group (ranking-down) of reactive topical corticosteroid. The randomization was executed using a minimization method that balanced factors such as institution, type of EGFR inhibitor, and sex. The control treatment (WEAK group) began with weak topical corticosteroids, which could be upgraded to stronger classes if symptoms worsened. Conversely, in the DOWN group, treatment started with very strong corticosteroids applied twice daily upon rash onset, with the strength decreased every 2 weeks (progressing from strong to medium, then weak). Prednisolone was specified as a weak class corticosteroid.

### The role of a midpotency topical corticosteroid and the clinical relevance of formulation characteristics in the management of commonly encountered eczematous and inflammatory dermatoses in adults and children: Focus on the pharmacologic properties of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream [^111SwKH9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Midpotency topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are frequently used for the treatment of common eczematous and inflammatory skin disorders in both adults and children. There are several commercially available products in this category, along with many vehicles and formulations for the clinician to choose from. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream is a midpotency TCS formulated in an emollient formulation, which has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated when used appropriately in the management of several corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.

This article discusses the physicochemical properties of the compound; the characteristics of its emollient cream formulation; the functions of individual excipients; and the efficacy, tolerability, and safety data supporting its use in adults and children, including for facial involvement.
