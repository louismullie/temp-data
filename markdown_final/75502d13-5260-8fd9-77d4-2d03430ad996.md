## Question

Diziness after squatting and getting up differential

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of dizziness that occurs after squatting and then standing up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features that distinguish orthostatic hypotension from positional vertigo. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and bedside maneuvers that separate BPPV from orthostatic intolerance syndromes. Next, I will consider less common but important mimics and red flags. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise evaluation and management plan, including when to image and when to refer, and I will double-check that each recommendation aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: dizziness after squatting and rising is a triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, so I should prioritize timing and triggers over symptom quality to build the differential, because "vertigo" versus "lightheadedness" is unreliable in patient descriptions and can mislead us toward or away from BPPV or orthostatic hypotension [^1132xzrG] [^111R64Nm].

> I will now examine the two leading etiologies. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) typically presents with lightheadedness, visual graying, weakness, or syncope within 3 minutes of standing, often worse after squatting due to venous pooling and impaired baroreflexes; the diagnostic threshold is a drop in systolic BP of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, and symptoms should reproduce with the maneuver to confirm causality [^114SnhnQ] [^112X4rJU] [^113XSwHB]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance: delayed OH can occur after 3 minutes, so if suspicion is high and active standing is negative, tilt testing can unmask it, especially in neurogenic OH or older adults [^115ip7JA] [^11576pJm].

> Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) produces brief, seconds-long vertigo with characteristic positional nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike or supine roll testing; importantly, BPPV can be triggered by moving from squat to stand if the head position change involves canalith movement, and patients may also report symptoms when rolling over in bed or looking up, which helps distinguish it from pure orthostatic dizziness [^114FPKMQ] [^113gmNgZ] [^117NxrEi]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic specificity: torsional upbeating nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike supports posterior canal BPPV, whereas horizontal nystagmus on supine roll testing supports horizontal canal BPPV, and these findings are not expected in orthostatic hypotension [^114FPKMQ] [^113gmNgZ].

> Next, I should review other orthostatic intolerance syndromes. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) presents with dizziness and palpitations on standing with a heart rate rise of more than 30 bpm within 10 minutes without orthostatic hypotension; this is more common in younger patients and can be unmasked or worsened by deconditioning or volume shifts after squatting, so I need to check orthostatic vitals with beat-to-beat monitoring when suspected [^116C7kKC] [^115ip7JA] [^111k9wf7]. But wait, what if the patient reports symptoms only when squatting and not on passive standing? That pattern would push me back toward BPPV or a mechanical trigger rather than classic POTS, so I should confirm the positional context carefully [^112BUNKs].

> I need to ensure I consider mimics and red flags. Cervicogenic dizziness can be provoked by neck motion during squat-to-stand and may coexist with cervical pain or limited range of motion; central positional vertigo is rare but should be considered if nystagmus is atypical, vertical or purely torsional without latency, or if there are other neurologic signs, in which case MRI is reasonable despite a negative Dix-Hallpike [^112BUNKs] [^111BJ4Bz]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in older adults, BPPV may present as vague unsteadiness without frank vertigo, so I should maintain a low threshold for positional testing even when patients do not report spinning, because missed BPPV increases fall risk [^111Nn7wF] [^113EtkmY].

> Let me first confirm the bedside diagnostic approach. I should measure supine, seated, and standing blood pressure and heart rate at 1 and 3 minutes to assess for OH, and I should perform Dix-Hallpike and, if indicated, supine roll testing to evaluate for BPPV; if both are negative but suspicion remains high, I should consider tilt testing for delayed OH or POTS, recognizing that active standing is the first-line orthostatic challenge in guidelines [^114SnhnQ] [^114FPKMQ] [^11576pJm]. I should double-check that I document symptom reproduction with the maneuver, because that strengthens causal inference for OH or BPPV [^112X4rJU] [^113gmNgZ].

> Next, I should review adjuncts and what to avoid. Routine labs or imaging are not required for straightforward BPPV or OH, and vestibular testing is not indicated for isolated BPPV without additional vestibular signs; however, if there are atypical features, focal deficits, or concern for central causes, MRI is appropriate, and if neurogenic OH is suspected, autonomic testing can refine etiology and guide therapy [^113gmNgZ] [^112SULQL] [^114T7wRv]. Wait, I initially thought CT might help in the ED for dizziness, but hold on, I should verify: routine CT is not recommended for undifferentiated dizziness without focal deficits, and MRI is preferred when central causes are suspected, so I should correct that impulse [^111BJ4Bz] [^112daYq2].

> I will now examine management for confirmed OH. Nonpharmacologic measures are first-line: liberalize salt and fluids if not contraindicated, sleep with the head of bed elevated, rise slowly with lower-body muscle tensing, and use compression stockings or an abdominal binder; rapid ingestion of 500 mL water can acutely raise standing BP by about 20–30 mmHg for an hour, and squatting or leg crossing with muscle tensing are effective physical counter-pressure maneuvers when prodrome allows [^114F7hsK] [^114SsPGF] [^1147VwHH]. Let me reconsider pharmacotherapy: if symptoms persist, midodrine or fludrocortisone can be added, but I need to monitor for supine hypertension and adjust dosing and timing accordingly [^114F7hsK] [^114SsPGF].

> For BPPV, I should confirm the canal and treat with the appropriate repositioning maneuver: Epley for posterior canal, Lempert or Gufoni for horizontal canal, and I should counsel on expected transient worsening during treatment and the high likelihood of resolution with 1–3 sessions; I should also screen for falls risk and ensure follow-up, as residual unsteadiness can persist and recurrence is common [^116wcroK] [^113EtkmY] [^11254mj8]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not recommend vestibular suppressants routinely, because they can delay compensation and are discouraged in isolated BPPV without another indication [^117AP6bq].

> For POTS, I need to ensure a graded exercise and volume repletion plan, with education on orthostatic pacing and counter-maneuvers; pharmacologic options like midodrine, fludrocortisone, or beta-blockers may be considered in refractory cases, but I should coordinate care with primary care or cardiology and screen for comorbidities that modify prognosis and treatment response [^115c74yY] [^112rzA3b] [^111k9wf7]. I should double-check that I am not conflating POTS with anxiety-related dizziness, which can coexist but requires distinct management and expectations [^111k9wf7].

> Finally, I should confirm safety netting and follow-up. Dizziness increases fall risk, particularly in older adults, so I should assess gait and balance, provide fall-prevention counseling, and arrange reassessment within about a month if symptoms persist; if the diagnosis remains uncertain or symptoms evolve, I should escalate to autonomic testing, neurology, or otolaryngology as appropriate [^113EtkmY] [^114YZfTT] [^114T7wRv]. Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed medication contributors and volume status at each visit, because these can perpetuate orthostatic symptoms and are often modifiable [^114PRwLT].

Dizziness after squatting and standing is most often due to **orthostatic hypotension** (OH) [^114SnhnQ] or **benign paroxysmal positional vertigo** (BPPV) [^112z8U4J], with less common causes including vestibular migraine, cardiac arrhythmias, anemia, dehydration, or medication effects [^1132xzrG]. OH is suggested by lightheadedness, vision changes, or syncope within 3 minutes of standing [^113XSwHB], while BPPV presents with brief, positional vertigo and nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike testing [^114FPKMQ]. Evaluation should include orthostatic vitals, a focused neurologic and cardiac exam, and selective testing (CBC, ECG, tilt table) if indicated [^1132xzrG] [^11576pJm]. Management is cause-specific: OH with hydration, salt, compression, and slow positional changes [^114F7hsK]; BPPV with canalith repositioning maneuvers [^116wcroK]; and other causes with targeted therapy [^1132xzrG].

---

## Pathophysiology and common causes

### Orthostatic hypotension (OH)

- **Definition**: A drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing [^114SnhnQ] [^113XSwHB].
- **Mechanism**: Impaired autonomic reflexes or volume depletion cause venous pooling and reduced preload, leading to hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion [^111DfMcy].
- **Triggers**: Rapid standing after squatting, dehydration, anemia, prolonged bed rest, or autonomic failure (e.g. diabetes, Parkinson's) [^114PRwLT] [^116TcaxU].

---

### Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

- **Definition**: Brief, positional vertigo from canalith debris in the semicircular canals [^112z8U4J].
- **Mechanism**: Head movements displace otoconia, causing abnormal endolymph flow and vertigo [^116GBtnu].
- **Triggers**: Quick head movements, including standing from squatting, rolling over, or looking up [^113kyVtK].

---

### Other causes

Other causes include **vestibular migraine** — recurrent vertigo with migraine features [^114pmFbF] — and **cardiac arrhythmias**, which cause abrupt hypotension or hypoperfusion [^1136nf6u]. Anemia and dehydration reduce oxygen delivery or intravascular volume, and medications such as antihypertensives, diuretics, or antidepressants can precipitate orthostatic symptoms [^114PRwLT].

---

## Clinical features and differentiation

| **Feature** | **Orthostatic hypotension** | **Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptom quality | Lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, syncope | Vertigo (spinning), nausea, imbalance |
| Duration | Seconds to minutes after standing | Brief (< 1 minute), positional |
| Nystagmus | Absent | Positional, torsional/upbeat |
| Diagnostic test | Orthostatic vitals (≥ 20/10 mmHg drop) | Dix-Hallpike maneuver [^114FPKMQ] |
| Triggers | Standing, dehydration, heat, medications | Head position changes, squat-to-stand |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should characterize symptom quality, duration, triggers, and associated features (e.g. syncope, nausea, headache, medication use) [^1132xzrG]. The **physical exam** should include orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements, a neurologic assessment, and a cardiac exam [^1132xzrG].

---

### Laboratory and imaging studies

Order **CBC** to assess for anemia, and obtain an **ECG** to screen for arrhythmias or ischemia [^notfound]. Use **tilt-table testing** when OH or POTS is suspected but not confirmed on active standing [^11576pJm]. Reserve **MRI** for focal deficits, atypical nystagmus, or concern for central causes [^111BJ4Bz].

---

## Management strategies

### Orthostatic hypotension

- **Non-pharmacologic**: Slow positional changes, hydration, salt intake, compression stockings, abdominal binders, and physical counter-maneuvers (leg crossing, squatting) [^114F7hsK] [^1147VwHH].
- **Pharmacologic**: Midodrine, fludrocortisone, droxidopa if refractory [^114F7hsK] [^114SsPGF].

---

### Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo

Use **canalith repositioning maneuvers** (Epley, Semont, Lempert) for high success and low recurrence [^116wcroK] [^116GBtnu]. Provide patient education on safety, recurrence risk, and follow-up [^115AWuWF].

---

### Other causes

Treat **vestibular migraine** with migraine prophylaxis and lifestyle changes [^notfound]. Manage **cardiac arrhythmias** with antiarrhythmic therapy or device therapy as indicated. Correct **anemia or dehydration** with iron, transfusion, or fluids, and adjust offending medications.

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive measures include **slow, controlled transitions** from squatting to standing, especially after prolonged squatting or in hot environments. Maintain adequate hydration and salt intake when not contraindicated, and use compression stockings or abdominal binders in patients with chronic OH. Engage in regular, graded exercise to improve vascular tone and orthostatic tolerance [^114PRwLT].

---

Dizziness after squatting and standing most often reflects **OH or BPPV**, with a focused history, exam, and selective testing guiding diagnosis. Management is cause-specific, emphasizing nonpharmacologic measures and targeted therapies to reduce recurrence and improve safety.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet under diagnosed disorder. It may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign, and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change. Evidence based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and the therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright position are necessary. OH is defined as fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 min in upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH, or in patients with motor impairment. The management initially consists of education, advice and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

Vasovagal syncope — recommendations for conservative care: Patient education on the diagnosis and prognosis of VVS is recommended, and physical counter-pressure maneuvers can be useful in patients with VVS who have a sufficiently long prodromal period; patients with a syncope prodrome should be instructed to assume a supine position to prevent a faint and minimize possible injury, and in those with a sufficiently long prodrome, physical counter-maneuvers (for example, leg crossing, limb and/or abdominal contraction, squatting) are a core management strategy; in a randomized, parallel, open-label trial, leg crossing with conventional therapy was superior to conventional therapy in preventing syncope recurrence.

How to treat OH in PD?

OH in PD should be treated with a stepwise approach. First, exacerbating factors such as concomitant infections, anemia, dehydration, and the combination of multiple drugs with BP lowering effect should be excluded or treated.

In a second step, non-pharmacological therapeutic measures should be considered. Rapid drinking of cold water has a significant, though transient, pressor effect lasting about 1 h. Studies showed that salt supplements had no additive effect with respect to increased water intake, but no dietary salt restriction should be recommended either. Large meals can produce significant falls in BP (e.g. post-prandial hypotension), and it is therefore advisable to divide the daily caloric intake into several smaller meals. Sleeping in a 10°–20° head up tilted position can also improve orthostatic tolerance the day after. A steeper head-up tilt sleeping position is likely more effective and can be pursued, if well tolerated. Physical counterpressure maneuvers (squatting or crossing the legs and tensing the leg, buttock, abdominal and arm muscles) can be recommended to stabilize the BP in case of dizziness. Wearing an elastic abdominal binder is an additional non-pharmacological option to increase orthostatic BP levels, and more effective than compression stockings.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

Physical counterpressure maneuvers for presyncope — methods include leg crossing with muscle tensing performed as leg crossing with tensing of the leg, abdominal, and buttock muscles while lying down or, if necessary, while standing; squatting by lowering the body into a squatting position with adjunctive lower-body and abdomen muscle tensing during the squat and then on standing once symptoms have resolved; arm tensing by gripping opposing hands with fingers and pulling with arms in opposing directions with maximum force; isometric handgrip by clenching the fist at maximum contraction with or without an item in the hand; and neck flexion by touching the chin to the chest and tightening the neck musculature.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114pcDYL]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance syndromes — education, volume expansion, and physical measures: Education regarding the nature of the condition with lifestyle advice can improve symptoms even when the rise in blood pressure is relatively small (10–15 mmHg). In the absence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to take sufficient salt and water intake, targeting 2–3 L of fluids per day and 10 g of NaCl. Sleeping with the head elevated (10°) prevents nocturnal polyuria, maintains a more favourable distribution of body fluids, and ameliorates nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings may be helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns and may also help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension. Rapid cold water ingestion is reported to be effective in combating orthostatic intolerance and post-prandial hypotension. Gravitational venous pooling in older patients can be treated with abdominal binders or compression stockings, and PCMs such as leg crossing and squatting should be encouraged in patients with warning symptoms able to perform them.

### Positional vertigo [^115U1Bjo]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Positional vertigo is a complex symptom that may arise from several disorders.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^115tXFhD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111YGjua]. DoD/VA (2021). High credibility.

Dizziness and disequilibrium — assessment in post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) should document symptom character, timing, and triggers, perform a targeted primary care vestibular assessment prior to referral, and include specified examination domains and functional testing, with referral to vestibular rehabilitation recommended once other causes are excluded. Dizziness and disequilibrium are common symptoms that individuals present with in the primary care settings and may be related to mTBI. In individuals with symptoms attributed to mTBI, a description and characterization of their dizziness, temporal pattern, and symptom-provoking activities provides valuable information in establishing a working differential diagnosis. Primary care assessment for vestibular disorders should be done before referring for further vestibular examination and rehabilitation, and observation and patient interview are key elements to guide care. Evaluation should include a thorough examination of neurologic function, orthostatics, vision, auditory, sensory, motor, cervical, and vestibular systems, and evaluation of functional activities should include sitting and standing balance and gait. Once the initial assessment is completed and other causes are eliminated, referral to a vestibular rehabilitation specialist is recommended for symptom management.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^116hw9yD]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for presyncope — supportive evidence: Physical injuries are frequent complications of syncope, occurring ≈30% of patients admitted to EDs, of whom ≈5% experience severe trauma, and therefore the initial goal of presyncope treatment should be to assume a safe position to decrease the risk of trauma. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials demonstrated an ≈50% reduction in the risk of syncope when PCMs were used compared with no intervention. An observational study enrolling 27 participants with recurrent vasovagal syncope demonstrated better improvements in heart rate and a lower likelihood of syncope with the use of lower-body PCM (squatting with leg crossing) compared with upper-body PCM (handgrip). In studies involving tilt-table testing, PCMs were able to improve cardiovascular parameters, reduce or eliminate symptoms of presyncope, and prevent syncope within seconds of implementing the PCM, and in a tilt table study of people with vasovagal syncope, continuously applied PCMs were beneficial for at least 2 minutes. Dangerous medical conditions such as myocardial infarction or stroke may cause presyncope, and although a systematic review found no reported adverse events or injuries from PCM use, the study populations included only people with known recurrent orthostatic or vasovagal syncope, and PCMs have not been advocated for cardiac causes of syncope and may delay definitive medical care.

### Distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness and vertigo without using HINTS or STANDING [^112bLcJj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Three validated diagnostic algorithms for diagnosing patients with acute onset dizziness or vertigo (HINTS, HINTS-plus and STANDING) exist. All are extremely accurate in distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness when done by experienced clinicians. However, uptake of these diagnostic tools in routine emergency medicine practice has been sub-optimal, in part, due to clinicians' unease with the head impulse test, the most useful component contained of these algorithms. Use of these validated algorithms is the best way to accurately diagnose patients with acute dizziness. For clinicians who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable performing or interpreting HINTS and STANDING, this article will suggest alternative approaches to help with accurate diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness or vertigo.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^11576pJm]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the preponderance of evidence, and working independently (a few members of each group provided reviews of the other document), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society collaborationarrived at similar and closely coherent recommendations for TT in unexplained syncope after initial clinical assessment [i.e. detailed history and basic examination including electrocardiogram (ECG) and orthostatic blood pressure measurement], agreeing on a class IIA indication. Furthermore, both groups proposed that when an autonomic disturbance was deemed likely, TT (with additional cardiovascular autonomic assessment, if appropriate) should be a preferred component of the diagnostic strategy.

Recent criticisms by Kulkarni et al. suggest that, like any diagnostic test, TT can be inappropriately applied. Nevertheless, extensive experience, as well as evidence-based practice guideline recommendations, provides clear direction for its appropriate application and indicates when so TT is an important, effective diagnostic tool. Use of other orthostatic stressors might be contemplated (e.g. active standing, squat-stand test), but these have not undergone the scrutiny as potential clinical tools to the degree that has TT, excepting evaluation of initial and classical OH and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome where active standing is well recognized, supported by evidence and, thus, by guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117966as]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing BPPV from other disorders can often be achieved by positional test responses. Most of these other disorders can be further distinguished from BPPV based on the responses to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and the supine roll test, and clinicians should remain alert for concurrent diagnoses accompanying BPPV, especially in patients with a mixed clinical presentation.

### Pure autonomic failure [^116TcaxU]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Pure autonomic failure is a degenerative disorder of the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients experience symptomatic hypotension that requires them to sit, squat or lie down to prevent syncope. It is associated with characteristic histopathological findings, resulting in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the peripheral autonomic nerves. These lesions are responsible for defects in the synthesis and release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals, resulting in significant hypotension. Patients with autonomic failure also have exaggerated blood pressure responses to common stimuli such as food or fluid intake, heat, exercise and medications. Tilt table (head-up) testing is probably the test most commonly used to establish the diagnosis. However, simple office testing is also useful, such as having the patient stand after lying supine with blood pressure monitoring. Treatment options range from simply increasing fluid and salt intake, and using compressive garments, to medications administered orally, subcutaneously or intravenously in more severe cases.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH): nonpharmacologic measures include physical counter-pressure maneuvers and compression garments (both Class IIa, Level of Evidence C-LD). Physical counter-pressure maneuvers "can be beneficial in patients with neurogenic OH with syncope", and isometric contraction methods "can increase blood pressure, with the largest effect occurring with squatting versus other counter-pressure maneuvers", with benefit limited to those with sufficient prodrome who can perform them safely. Compression garments "can be beneficial in patients with syncope and OH", and "should be at least thigh high and preferably include the abdomen".

Guideline statements

Q1. What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered?

SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma); 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement of the headache on lying flat (as defined below); thunderclap headache which is followed by orthostatic headache; and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms (see table 3) should increase the suspicion of SIH.

Table 3
Commonly associated symptoms and rare presentations of SIH*

We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as headache which meets the following criteria:

Absent or only mild (1–3/10 on verbal rating scale (VRS)) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
The onset of the headache occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright.
After lying flat, the headache should have a 'good' improvement in severity (> 50% on VRS) within 2 hours.
The timing of headache onset and offset is consistent.

Q2. What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed?

Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache and migraine.

PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and haemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests to document objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by > 30 beats per minute) or orthostatic hypotension (fall of > 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and/or > 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure). A negative standing test does not exclude the diagnosis of PoTS and if clinical suspicion is high consider additional autonomic testing.

Cervicogenic headache (in the presence of cervical pathology) can be diagnosed with a history confirming that the headache is provoked by cervical movement rather than posture, reduced cervical range of motion and associated myofascial tenderness.

Migraine can be diagnosed with a history confirming that the headache is provoked by movement rather than posture, establishing migrainous biology, including history and trajectory of episodes, presence of aura and vertigo (rather than hearing impairment and tinnitus).

Thunderclap headache presentations are most likely to be related to acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and its wider differential, of which SIH should be considered.

### History… [^112cy6SF]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Physical Examination Physicians should pay particular attention to physical findings of the neurologic, head and neck, and cardiovascular systems. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION The cranial nerves should be examined for signs of palsies, sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus is 80 percent sensitive for vestibular nuclear or cerebellar vermis lesions. 2 Spontaneous horizontal nystagmus with or without rotatory nystagmus is consistent with acute vestibular neuronitis. Patients with peripheral vertigo have impaired balance but are still able to walk, whereas patients with central vertigo have more severe instability and often cannot walk or even stand without falling. 14 Although Romberg's sign is consistent with a vestibular or proprioceptive problem, it is not particularly useful in the diagnosis of vertigo.

In one study, 22 it was only 19 percent sensitive for peripheral vestibular disorders and did not correlate with more serious causes of dizziness such as drug-related dizziness, seizure, arrhythmia, or cerebrovascular events. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver. 15 The combination of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a history of vertigo or vomiting suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder. 22 If the maneuver provokes purely vertical or torsional nystagmus without a latent period of at least a few seconds, and does not wane with repeated maneuvers, this suggests a central cause for vertigo such as a posterior fossa tumor or hemorrhage. 14, 15. HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION The tympanic membranes should be examined for vesicles or cholesteatoma. Hennebert's sign indicates the presence of a perilymphatic fistula. CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION Orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and pulse in patients with vertigo upon standing may identify problems with dehydration or autonomic dysfunction. 10 Carotid sinus stimulation should not be performed; it has been shown to be not useful diagnostically 22 and potentially is dangerous.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) diagnosis — confirmation relies on bedside maneuvers rather than routine imaging or laboratory tests: "Normal medical imaging, such as scans and x-rays, or medical laboratory testing cannot confirm BPPV". Instead, clinicians use "simple bedside testing", moving the head (e.g., "hanging your head a little off the edge of the bed" or rolling left and right) while watching "for a certain eye movement" to confirm the diagnosis; "The most common tests are called either the Dix-Hallpike test or supine roll test".

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

2017 ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) management states that acute water ingestion is recommended in patients with syncope caused by neurogenic OH for occasional, temporary relief, and that physical counter-pressure maneuvers, compression garments, and midodrine can be beneficial. In neurogenic OH, acute water ingestion can temporarily restore orthostatic tolerance and is not intended for routine or long-term use. Physical counter-pressure maneuvers, including isometric contraction such as leg crossing, lower body muscle tensing, maximal force handgrip, and squatting, can increase blood pressure, but the benefit is limited to patients with sufficient prodrome and the ability to perform these maneuvers adequately and safely. Compression garments can improve orthostatic symptoms and blunt associated blood pressure decreases and should be at least thigh high and preferably include the abdomen. Midodrine can be beneficial, with a dose-dependent effect usually corresponding to an increase in standing blood pressure, though its use may be limited by supine hypertension and side effects including scalp tingling, piloerection, and urinary retention.

Management

A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Wherever possible, underlying causes should be identified by thorough work-up and the treatment strategy adapted accordingly. In addition, the magnitude of symptoms and the presence of asymptomatic OH should be considered. Available treatment options range from non-pharmacological options to aggressive drug therapy. While therapy of non-neurogenic OH is mostly straight-forward, NOH is often difficult to treat and a combination of non-pharmacological measures and drugs is required. Pharmacological agents can lead to different responses in patients with central neurodegeneration compared to those with peripheral neurodegeneration, and the latter has to be considered in the treatment as well.

Nevertheless, NOH massively affect patients' quality of life because of the disabling symptoms of autonomic failure. However, most of these symptoms could be alleviated by non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. Therapeutic interventions should be implemented stepwise depending on the severity of symptoms. If non-pharmacological measures do not attenuate NOH symptoms sufficiently, pharmacological interventions may become necessary. Nevertheless, supine hypertension has to be taken into consideration in pharmacological treatment.

Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures should be considered first in NOH. Such measures include a stepwise raising from supine to standing position, physical exercise in order to avoid deconditioning, taking care of proper defection and compression stockings. An abdominal bandage may also be useful in attenuating orthostatic dysregulation by restricting splanchnic blood pooling and, similarly, physical maneuvers such as night time head-up tilt, leg-crossing, thigh contraction and squatting improve cerebral perfusion. The spreading of total daily carbohydrate intake to multiple smaller meals was shown to beneficially affect orthostatic symptoms. The effect of 500 mL oral water ingestion typically increases blood pressure 20–30 mmHg for about an hour, and sometimes greatly potentiates the pressor effect of other drugs. Finally, adequate salt and fluid intake may be useful with dietary sodium intake of at least 10 g per day and a fluid intake of more than 2 l per day. However, it has to be considered that increased fluid and salt intake may be harmful in patients with concomitant renal dysfunction and, thus, dietary fluid and salt intake requires regular check-up.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111BJ4Bz]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3 — t-EVS differential and bedside diagnostic features — The key differential diagnosis in t-EVS is between the relatively rare central paroxysmal positional vertigo and the very common BPPV, and patients are usually asymptomatic at rest in the ED but, by definition, their symptoms can be triggered/reproduced at the bedside with positional testing, so physical examination has the potential to make a confident specific diagnosis. Aggregated evidence supports a strong recommendation for use of the Dix–Hallpike test to diagnose pc-BPPV when the triggered and transient upbeat torsional nystagmus is present, whereas it supports a conditional recommendation for use of MRI in cases with atypical nystagmus or lack of response to canalith repositioning treatments. BPPV can sometimes be mistaken for orthostatic hypotension, but symptoms in BPPV usually also occur on reclining or when rolling over in bed, episodes that occur during sleep strongly suggest BPPV, and patients with orthostatic hypotension rarely have nystagmus on positional testing unless the hypotension is profound.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^11254mj8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling and follow-up — expected course, activity guidance, recurrence risk, and actions for persistent symptoms are outlined as follows: Mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist, and these mild symptoms can take a few days to a few weeks to resolve; follow up if dizziness or instability do not improve in a few days to a couple of weeks. Balance may be "off", so take precautions to avoid falls, return to normal activities that you can do safely, and note that exposure to motion and movement will help to speed healing. BPPV can sometimes return, with risk shifting from low risk (few experiences in your lifetime) to higher risk from factors such as trauma, other inner ear or medical conditions, or aging; medical research has not found any way to stop recurrence, but it can be treated with a high rate of success. If symptoms persist after initial treatments, it is not uncommon to need more than 1 repositioning session, BPPV can sometimes be in more than 1 canal and/or side requiring multiple treatments, seek a health professional who specializes in BPPV, and recognize that leftover dizziness may require more time (few days to couple of weeks); follow-up is important and further testing may confirm the diagnosis and/or guide future treatment options.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^115ip7JA]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Moving from supine to upright posture rarely induces syncope in normal healthy patients but may cause minor worrisome symptoms. For instance, a transient sensation of 'greying out/dizziness/light-headedness/unsteadiness' is common immediately after upright postural change (so-called 'initial' or 'immediate' OH). While usually harmless, this sensation may cause alarm/instability in some patients. Active standing is sufficient to document this problem and initiate treatment. Thus, active standing should be seen as a necessary, complementary aspect of cardiovascular autonomic workup in unexplained syncope, optimally with beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring for diagnostic accuracy.

Delayed OH is a far more important clinical problem, especially in older patients, debilitated patients, those with neurogenic OH, or in diseases that affect neurological responses, such as diabetes or alcohol abuse. In these cases, OH may be considerably delayed after change of posture that can result in fall injury. Active standing may not be tolerated for sufficient time to be diagnostic with additional fall injury risk during testing. TT avoids injury risk while providing the possibility of defining the diagnosis.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — differential diagnosis and prevalence across settings are outlined with policy metadata: Exceptions: None; Policy level: Recommendation; Differences of opinion: None. Differential diagnosis spans otologic, neurologic, and other entities, including Ménière's disease, Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis; neurologic conditions such as Vestibular migraine, Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack and stroke, Demyelinating diseases, Central nervous system lesions, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Central positional vertigo; and other entities including Anxiety or panic disorder, Cervicogenic vertigo, Medication side effects, Postural hypotension, and Various medical conditions (eg, toxic, infectious, and metabolic conditions). Epidemiology varies by setting: In a German telephone survey of > 1000 patients with dizziness, BPPV accounted for 8% of cases; in a British general practice setting, BPPV accounted for 42% of cases, followed by vestibular neuritis (41%), Ménière's disease (10%), vascular cases (3%), and other causes (3%); and in subspecialty populations, BPPV accounts for 20% to 53% of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat specialty clinics for dizziness. Diagnostic considerations note that BPPV has been described as occurring in conjunction with, or as a consequence of, other vestibular disorders as well, so clinicians should consider the possibility of > 1 vestibular disorder being present and emphasize that taking a history that focuses on the timing and triggers of a patient's dizziness is more important than the specific descriptor that patients use.

### Post-COVID-19 dizziness associated with a patulous eustachian tube [^115WUPc5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Dizziness following a SARS-CoV-2 infection can arise from a variety of causes. Dizziness is a frequently described symptom of long COVID, but is usually one of the multiple symptoms and is rarely seen as the sole symptom of long COVID. Dysautonomia, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), can lead to dizziness on standing due to abnormal heart rate and blood pressure regulation, but the patient did not experience any POTS symptoms, and dizziness occurred irrespective of standing up or sitting.

Common causes of dizziness, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular neuronitis, have already been excluded by medical history and examination. Medication side effects can sometimes also induce dizziness, but this seemed unlikely to be induced by nasal corticosteroids, also because dizziness presented weeks before the patient started taking medication. A CT scan ruled out the presence of a third window anomaly, and the patient's symptoms were not consistent with those typically associated with third window syndromes such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Also, there were no signs of a perilymphatic fistula, except for the dizziness that was associated with changes in middle ear pressure.

A potential cause of dizziness in this patient came from the diagnosed PET and the observation that dizziness was only present on nasal respiration. The highly specific presentation of vestibulo-visual symptoms triggered by nasal respiration, but not by oral respiration or breath-holding, made this case stand out as a unique set of complaints, with the exception of the previously mentioned case report.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^114PRwLT]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Identify and optimise non-neurogenic causes of OH. Culprit medications should be reviewed, especially α- and β-blockers, diuretics, nitrates, anticholinergic and psychoactive medications. Night-time anti-hypertensive administration can improve cardiovascular outcomes, with attention to dosage, time of administration and half-life of the chosen medication, which may mitigate effects of supine hypertension and pressure natriuresis. Fluid balance should be assessed, with attention to caffeine and alcohol intake, anxieties about continence and other illnesses such as diarrhoea. Finally, anaemia, vitamin B12 and vitamin D status should be optimised.

Avoid the supine position completely. This should be emphasised to the patient (and carers) explaining the underlying physiology — that this position induces supine hypertension, which leads to pressure natriuresis, dehydration and worsening OH. Similarly, BP augmenting agents must not be taken when supine as they will increase the risk of supine hypertension without manifesting benefits. Patients should be advised to sleep with the head of the bed raised to 12 degrees at least, or higher if tolerated, to avoid this. Steps must be taken to avoid slipping off the bed during the night.

Avoid bed-rest. Hospitalised patients in particular may be considered at risk of falls and unsafe to get up, which will worsen deconditioning effects. Ensuring that the bed is tilted and gradually increasing sitting duration (for example, sitting on the edge of the bed with supervision, in the first instance) should occur as soon as the problem is identified and guided by physiotherapy.

Ensure fluid repletion, aiming for 2–2.5 L of fluid per day. Drinking a 500-ml bolus of water prior to standing has a vasopressor effect and is an effective intervention. Compression garments, particularly abdominal binders should be considered. Buttock clenching is particularly valuable in older patients.

Patients should be reminded to be cautious on standing up, especially after prolonged resting. Those who are able to should be taught to employ counter-pressure manoeuvres such as squatting, leg crossing and lower body tensing to improve cardiac venous return. Carrying a portable seat can be helpful if standing is unavoidable

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113EtkmY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^113wqDst]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

STANDING algorithm for patients with dizziness, vertigo, or instability — structure, validation, and performance: The algorithm directs clinicians to examine for nystagmus and proceed via sequential steps "1: Is nystagmus present? 2: Nystagmus characteristics? 3: If HIT is indicated, what is the result? 4: Patient can stand/walk independently?", with action nodes including "Perform Head Impulse test", "Supine head roll test for hc-BPPV", and "Dix-Hallpike test for pc-BPPV", and terminal labels "Central cause of symptoms" and "Peripheral cause of symptoms". The protocol "has been internally and externally validated" and "is a focused physical examination aimed at differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness (and specifically making the diagnosis of pc- and hc-BPPV) in four steps", with step descriptions specifying nystagmus presence/characteristics, head impulse testing for spontaneous direction-fixed nystagmus, and final assessment of gait unsteadiness. Reported performance shows that the "sensitivity for identifying a central cause of the dizziness (mostly strokes) ranged from 93.4% to 100% and the specificities from 71.8% to 94.3%", it "does not include the test of skew (part of HINTS) or test of hearing (part of HINTS plus)", and "The average time needed for emergency physicians to perform the STANDING protocol is less than 3 min".

### Clinical progress note: diagnostic approach to dizziness and vertigo [^1171j8NP]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common clinical presentation that incurs huge financial costs. It is frequently misdiagnosed due to a wide differential involving both benign (inner ear disease) and serious (stroke) disorders. Traditional frameworks that emphasize symptom quality (dizziness/lightheadedness/vertigo) lack diagnostic utility. This Clinical Progress Note reviews the literature on acute dizziness evaluation in adult patients and presents an evidence-based framework for hospitalists to diagnose the majority of undifferentiated dizzy patients at the bedside. Future research should assess the validity of this approach with hospitalists' ability to accurately diagnose dizzy patients, and its impact on patient care and healthcare outcomes.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111DfMcy]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance — pathophysiology and symptoms — are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

Introduction

Patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) must be diagnosed quickly to identify those needing urgent treatment. The diagnostic algorithm varies according to the leading symptoms upon presentation and possible differential diagnoses. Vertigo and dizziness (VD) are among the most frequent symptoms reported by patients at ER consultations. In neurological ER services, VD accounts for > 10% of patients and is the third most common leading symptom after headache (20%) and motor deficit (13%), respectively, after cerebrovascular disorders (28%) and headache (22%). VD may present as acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) in unilateral vestibular dysfunction (peripheral or central), but other diagnoses have to be kept in mind from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to anxiety related dizziness. Patients presenting to the ER are diverse with regard to presenting symptoms, underlying pathologies, pre-existing conditions, age and socioeconomic background. The major concern for ER physicians is to differentiate between potential life-threatening central symptoms and disorders that are more benign. Over the last years, algorithms have been suggested to distinguish between posterior circulation stroke and vestibular neuritis in AVS, i.e. in patients presenting with rotational vertigo, horizontal-rotatory spontaneous nystagmus, postural imbalance with directional falls, nausea, and vomiting. For clinical evaluation, the HINTS procedure (head impulse test, gaze evoked nystagmus, skew deviation) is now widely applied but its usability is still under discussion. In addition, there is growing evidence for predictive factors in non-AVS VD. For the current study we asked the following questions: (1) which patient groups present to the ER and how does the spectrum of disorders differ between ER and a tertiary care outpatient dizziness clinic?; (2) how is the usage of diagnostic/imaging procedures to differentiate between benign and serious causes of VD?; and (3) does the seasonal and circadian distribution of presentation differ between diagnoses? To address these questions, we performed a retrospective chart analysis of all non-surgical patients presenting in a 1-year period to the ER of a tertiary care university hospital in Germany. We hypothesized to see (1) more AVS patients compared to a tertiary care dizziness clinic in the ER; (2) a high number of diagnostic imaging without any pathologic correlate; and (3) a peak of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in morning hours, presentation of stroke/transitoric ischemic attack (TIA) without specific circadian peaks, and a seasonal preponderance of vestibular neuritis (UVH) in spring and autumn because of the suspected viral etiology.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^1114Ts7Z]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Autonomic/exertional tolerance impairments — physical therapists should test for orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysfunction by evaluating heart rate and blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions, and should conduct a symptom-guided, graded exertional tolerance test for patients reporting exertional intolerance, dizziness, headache, and/or a desire to return to high-level exertional activities, tailoring timing, modality, and protocol to optimize safety; for patients highly symptomatic at rest, the test should be delayed until symptoms are stable and more tolerable at rest, and clinicians may postpone testing if other symptoms and impairments are of higher priority; testing modality and protocol should be based on clinical judgment, patient comfort, and equipment availability, with heart rate and blood pressure monitored periodically throughout and afterward with symptom and rating-of-perceived-exertion responses; if vestibulo-oculomotor or cervical spine impairments or symptoms are present, a stationary bicycle should be used to reduce the risk of exacerbating impairments or compromising validity; clinicians may use orthostatic/autonomic assessments and symptom-guided graded exertional tolerance tests even when exertional intolerance is not reported to help determine contributions of autonomic dysfunction, deconditioning, or fitness to symptoms, and may conduct exertional tests in such patients to rule out subtle autonomic dysfunction, establish initial postconcussion performance level, and identify exertional targets for aerobic exercise training that may promote brain health and healing.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline — diagnosis and testing: Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and the maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative (Strong recommendation). If the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus, the clinician should perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV (Recommendation). Clinicians should differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo (Recommendation). Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging (Recommendation (against)), and clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing (Recommendation (against)).

### Differential diagnosis… [^113kB7ow]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Athletes who describe being "unconscious" but are able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in immediate danger of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although metabolic abnormalities may be present. Directly after the event, important clues to the etiology, such as seizure activity, incontinence and immediate vital signs, should be sought. Seizures commonly occur as a result of hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion and, therefore, do not always indicate that epilepsy is the underlying cause of syncope. The second critical distinction is whether the syncopal event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension that occurs after exercise, usually in association with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise.

Prodromal symptoms occurring during exercise, including palpitations, chest pain, nausea, wheezing and pruritis, are also significant. As in the evaluation of syncope in nonathletes, it is also important to identify whether syncope or dizziness occurs only in the upright position or also during sitting or supine positions. Echocardiography should be performed for the evaluation of murmurs that are diastolic, continuous, holosystolic or of intensity grade 3 or greater. Listening to the patient during squatting, while standing and during a Valsalva maneuver helps to rule out dynamic outflow obstruction. A systolic murmur that gets louder with standing or during a Valsalva maneuver suggests the obstruction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The clinician is also reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic.

Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and imaging of the brain to exclude a structural lesion. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated. Diabetic patients taking insulin, athletes with eating disorders and patients taking beta-blockers should be assessed for hypoglycemia. Black athletes with a history of collapse associated with high altitude training, dehydration or hyperthermia should be screened for sickle cell trait.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management [^112i64BX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a variant of cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on standing and orthostatic intolerance. POTS affects younger individuals 15–45 years old with a distinct female predominance (≈80%). The prevalence ranges between 0.2% and 1.0% in developed countries. The onset of POTS is typically precipitated by immunological stressors such as viral infection, vaccination, trauma, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. The most common complaints are dizziness, weakness, rapid heartbeat and palpitation on standing. Moreover, patients often report physical deconditioning and reduced exercise capacity as well as headache, 'brain fog', dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal pain. The aetiology of POTS is largely unknown and three main hypotheses include an autoimmune disorder, abnormally increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine excess, and sympathetic denervation leading to central hypovolaemia and reflex tachycardia. The golden standard for POTS diagnosis is head-up tilt test with a non-invasive beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. Although long-term prognosis of POTS is poorly explored, around 50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1–3 years. After the diagnosis has been established, patient should be thoroughly educated about non-pharmacological measures alleviating the symptoms. Exercise training may be very effective and counteract deconditioning. In more symptomatic patients, different drugs directed at controlling heart rate, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and intravascular volume can be tested. However, the overall effects of pharmacological therapy are modest and the most affected patients remain handicapped. Future efforts should focus on better understanding of POTS pathophysiology and designing randomized controlled trials for selection of more effective therapy.

### Neurological update: dizziness [^116fLHDh]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The world of dizziness has experienced a dramatic change over the last 3 decades, as new treatable syndromes have been identified, and novel treatments developed for existing vestibular diagnoses. Despite such progress, many clinicians, including neurologists, admit to a lack of confidence in the diagnosis and management of the dizzy patient, leading to circuitous patient journeys, from one specialty to another. Most emergency and primary care 'dizzy' referrals in the UK are fielded to ENT surgeons, a departure from neuro towards otology, although it could be argued that vertigo is a neurological symptom, a cortically driven percept, irrespective of the causative insult.

One common challenge in the field is elderly patients reporting a vague sense of dizziness and imbalance, who as a result of normal audiovestibular testing, remain "unexplained". I will review recent evidence suggesting possible mechanisms relating to small vessel disease that may contribute to this syndrome. Whilst new variants of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) have been recently described, the Epley and Semont treatment manoeuvres for the commonest type of BPPV are still not universally employed by neurologists, and BPPV remains under-diagnosed, and under-treated. The commonest differential diagnosis for BPPV is vestibular migraine, a condition that is increasingly recognised outside specialist centres, but remains under-diagnosed. Here, I review the most recent advances in vestibular migraine (VM) diagnosis and treatment. VM in turn is a common precursor to a more chronic form of dizziness recently renamed persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD), and there has been a growth in the unravelling of the neurobiology of this disorder. Finally, vestibular neurology is rich in clinical bedside skills; indeed, an evaluation of eye movements may more precisely identify and localise a stroke than state-of-the-art imaging. I describe and review the use and utility of the HINTS examination in stroke.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116wcroK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) management — repositioning maneuvers are emphasized with defined effectiveness and precautions: "medications are not used other than for relief of immediate distress", and most cases "can be corrected with bedside repositioning exercises that take only a few minutes to complete" with "high success rates (around 80%) with only 1–3 treatments". Maneuvers can be performed at the time of diagnostic testing or by health professionals, and patients can be taught supervised "self-repositioning". Brief distress during treatment can include vertigo, nausea, and disorientation, and "These symptoms can take a few hours or a few days to go away". While untreated BPPV "can go away within weeks", the text warns that "your unsteadiness can increase your risk for falling", states "You will need to take precautions not to fall", and notes "Seniors are encouraged to seek professional help quickly to help to resolve symptoms".

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^115VBww4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^114AtEww]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What might underlie this apparent advantage? As shown in the fourth column of Fig. 1, patients with nonperipheral dizziness reported many of the assessed symptoms more intensely during caloric stimulation than patients with peripheral dizziness. One might be tempted to conclude that it is the symptom intensity during caloric stimulation, rather than the comparison between conditions, that carries diagnostic value. However, a more differentiated pattern emerges when comparing symptom reports from self-experienced dizziness (column 3) with those elicited by caloric stimulation (column 4). For the three symptoms of spinning vertigo, imbalance, and nausea, a reverse pattern becomes apparent: patients with nonperipheral dizziness reported these symptoms more intensely during caloric stimulation, but less intensely during self-experienced dizziness, as compared to those with peripheral dizziness. This suggests that group differences in both conditions — caloric stimulation and self-experienced dizziness — may amplify one another when analysed using difference scores. In contrast, symptoms related to general dizziness, depersonalisation/derealisation, and heat showed a different pattern: they were also reported more intensely by patients with nonperipheral dizziness during caloric stimulation, but ratings during self-experienced dizziness were comparable to — or even slightly higher than — those of patients with peripheral dizziness. Thus, for these symptoms, it appears that the group differences observed in the comparison derive mainly from caloric stimulation rather than from differences in self-experienced dizziness. For the few symptoms rated more intensely by patients with nonperipheral dizziness in both conditions, the summed intensity across conditions (see column 5) might offer additional diagnostic value.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management… [^113kyVtK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

With spontaneous episodic symptoms, patients have episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to days. Because these episodes have no trigger, the patient's history establishes the diagnosis. Common diagnostic considerations for spontaneous episodic symptoms include Meniere disease, vestibular migraine, and psychiatric diagnoses such as anxiety disorders. Symptoms associated with lying down are more likely vestibular. Physicians should determine whether the vertigo is triggered by a specific position or change in position. BPPV is triggered with sudden changes in position, such as a quick turn of the head on awakening or tipping the head back in the shower. Dizziness from orthostatic hypotension occurs with movement to the upright position. Clinicians may erroneously assume that dizziness that worsens with movement is associated with a benign condition in patients with persistent dizziness. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed.

Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway. The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result. Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. 32 It can cause severe rotatory vertigo with nausea and apparent movement of objects in the visual field, horizontally rotating spontaneous nystagmus to the nonaffected side, or an abnormal gait with a tendency to fall to the affected side.

Hearing is not impaired in this condition. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is not useful because patients with vestibular neuritis do not have episodic positionally triggered symptoms. As vestibular compensation occurs, the patient's vertigo resolves slowly over a few days. 33 In 50% of patients, the underlying nerve damage may take two months to resolve. 34 However, a sensation of disequilibrium may persist for months because of unilateral impairment of vestibular function. Vertigo may recur, indicating interference with compensation. If the attacks do not become successively shorter, another diagnosis should be considered.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^114d7mkK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria (orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope), ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome when there is an orthostatic HR increase (> 30 bpm or > 120 bpm within 10 minutes of active standing) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117NxrEi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — history and symptom profile indicate brief episodes but warrant confirmatory testing. Patients with BPPV most commonly report discrete, episodic periods of vertigo lasting ≤ 1 minute, and approximately 50% of patients also report subjective imbalance between episodes; a cupulolithiasis variant may result in nystagmus that may persist for > 1 minute. In up to one-third of cases with atypical histories of positional vertigo, Dix-Hallpike testing will still reveal positional nystagmus, and history alone is insufficient to render an accurate diagnosis of BPPV.

### We should be screening for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all older adults at risk of falling: a commentary on the World Falls Guidelines [^111Nn7wF]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is amongst the commonest causes of dizziness and falls in older adults. Diagnosing and treating BPPV can reduce falls, and thereby reduce fall-related morbidity and mortality. Recent World Falls Guidelines recommend formal assessment for BPPV in older adults at risk of falling, but only if they report vertigo. However, this recommendation ignores the data that (i) many older adults with BPPV experience dizziness as vague unsteadiness (rather than vertigo), and (ii) others may experience no symptoms of dizziness at all. BPPV without vertigo is due to an impaired vestibular perception of self-motion, termed 'vestibular agnosia'. Vestibular agnosia is found in ageing, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, and results in dramatically increased missed BPPV diagnoses. Patients with BPPV without vertigo are typically the most vulnerable for negative outcomes associated with this disorder. We thus recommend simplifying the World Falls Guidelines: all older adults (> 60 years) with objective or subjective balance problems, irrespective of symptomatic complaint, should have positional testing to examine for BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113ZLzRv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, more specifically with respect to vestibular function testing (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine vestibular testing in patients meeting diagnostic criteria for BPPV without additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms warranting testing.

### Epley and beyond: an update on treating positional vertigo [^116GBtnu]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the commonest cause of dizziness. It is characterised by brief episodes of vertigo and imbalance with nystagmus. The direction of nystagmus allows the identification of the culprit semicircular canal. As it is readily treatable — and often curable — BPPV should not be missed. Although recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by movement suggest BPPV, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. Here we review the diagnostic manoeuvres required to diagnose BPPV, and the various repositioning manoeuvres for treating different types of BPPV.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^116tYnSR]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — autonomic symptoms and differentials include dizziness or lightheadedness with postural changes; presyncopal or syncopal episodes; and any other autonomic symptoms (eg, racing heart, temperature intolerance, changes to digestion, perspiration). Differential diagnoses to consider (new, worsening, or underlying) include vertigo or other vestibular pathology, sleep disorders/deprivation, MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome), cardiac abnormalities, small fiber neuropathy, and hypermobility spectrum disorders.
