## Question

Sokolow Lyon criterium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Sokolow-Lyon criterion for electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, including its definition, performance, modifiers, prognostic value, and practical application. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact definition and measurement conventions. Then, I should verify diagnostic performance and limitations. Next, I will examine modifiers such as obesity, sex, race/ethnicity, and age. After that, I should review prognostic implications and treatment-related regression. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note controversies or gaps that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and measurement details. The Sokolow-Lyon index is the sum of the S wave in lead V1 and the R wave in lead V5 or V6, using whichever R wave is larger, with a positive test typically defined as a sum of at least 35 mm, which equals 3.5 mV given standard calibration where 10 mm equals 1 mV, and I should double-check that this threshold is indeed the conventional cut-off used in contemporary guidelines and statements, which it is [^116fcVqc] [^114BEbbc].

> Wait, let me verify the underlying pathophysiology before moving to performance. Increased left ventricular mass augments electrical forces directed posteriorly and laterally, increasing S in V1 and R in V5/V6, so the index rises with LVH. However, I need to ensure I don't overstate specificity because noncardiac factors like chest wall thickness and electrode placement also modulate voltage, which is precisely why specificity is often high but sensitivity is limited in real-world populations [^116fcVqc].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — systematic data consistently show low sensitivity, often in the teens to low thirties, with specificity commonly in the high eighties to nineties. For example, in a large hypertensive cohort, sensitivity was about 14.7% with specificity around 96.7%, and a systematic review concluded that ECG criteria, including Sokolow-Lyon, should not be used to rule out LVH because negative results minimally reduce post-test probability, which is a critical limitation in clinical decision-making [^116S1EnL] [^113eTc79].

> I will now examine obesity as a key modifier. Let me think about mechanisms: increased chest wall and pericardial fat attenuate precordial voltages, and leftward axis deviation further reduces the Sokolow-Lyon sum. Indeed, matched analyses show Sokolow-Lyon voltages drop by roughly 4 mm in overweight and 8 mm in obesity, explaining why sensitivity can fall to the single digits in obesity unless adjusted, which is a major reason for false negatives in heavier patients [^113sz4Qy] [^111praEd] [^111NyhjK].

> But wait, what if we adjust the threshold for BMI. Studies propose adding 4 mm in overweight and 8 mm in obesity, which restores sensitivity toward non-obese levels while preserving excellent specificity. For instance, sensitivity rose from about 3% to 27% in obesity in one cohort, and similar gains were validated in independent samples, though I should confirm that these adjustments are not yet universally adopted in guidelines, which remains the case [^113sz4Qy] [^115Z2EDd].

> Let me consider sex differences next. I should confirm whether women have systematically lower voltages; yes, women tend to have smaller QRS amplitudes, so the same absolute threshold may yield lower sensitivity in women, and some studies suggest that combining Sokolow-Lyon with Cornell criteria improves detection across sexes, while prognostic analyses indicate ECG-LVH may carry higher risk associations in women than men, reinforcing the need to interpret a positive result carefully in female patients [^116fcVqc] [^114ohsh5] [^114mxnLs].

> I need to check race and ethnicity effects. African American patients often have higher precordial voltages, leading to greater sensitivity but lower specificity for Sokolow-Lyon at fixed thresholds. Importantly, when distributions are accounted for, test performance can be similar, implying that ethnicity-specific partitions could equalize detection, though standard practice still uses common thresholds in many settings [^111wNxzG] [^116fcVqc].

> Hold on, I should verify age-related considerations. For adults older than about 35 years, conventional voltage criteria are reasonably applicable, whereas in younger adults and athletes, high QRS voltages are common and specificity is lower, so false positives are more frequent. Sex-specific athletic thresholds and age-tailored interpretation are prudent to avoid overcalling LVH in these groups [^116fcVqc] [^1143iHSf].

> Next, I should review prognostic value, because even with limited sensitivity, a positive Sokolow-Lyon result may carry risk. In the LIFE program, both baseline severity and in-treatment reductions in Sokolow-Lyon voltage were independently associated with lower risks of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, with approximately a 17% risk reduction per standard deviation decrease in voltage, and similar benefits were seen in isolated systolic hypertension subgroups, underscoring that serial change is informative for prognosis [^112e5oBM] [^117Ts6A7].

> Let me consider treatment-related regression and its implications. Losartan-based therapy produced greater regression of both Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage than atenolol in LIFE, and this regression tracked with fewer cardiovascular events and less new-onset atrial fibrillation, supporting the concept that ECG-LVH is a modifiable risk marker and that its reduction during therapy is clinically meaningful beyond blood pressure changes alone [^1112QWDp] [^112zqdf7].

> I should double-check how to apply this at the bedside. First, measure S in V1 and R in V5 or V6 and sum them; if the sum is at least 35 mm, LVH by Sokolow-Lyon is present. Second, interpret in context: a positive test increases post-test probability but a negative test does not reliably exclude LVH, so in patients with hypertension or other risk factors, consider echocardiography if management would change. Third, in obesity, consider applying BMI-adjusted thresholds by adding 4 mm if overweight and 8 mm if obese, recognizing this is evidence-based but not yet guideline-mandated. Fourth, combine with other ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage or product to improve sensitivity, and document which criterion was used for clarity and comparability [^114BEbbc] [^113sz4Qy] [^116fcVqc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that newer alternatives replace Sokolow-Lyon outright; let me reconsider. Peguero-Lo Presti and other novel criteria can increase sensitivity at the cost of specificity, and in some cohorts perform better than Sokolow-Lyon, but overall test performance varies by population and reference standard, so Sokolow-Lyon remains a simple, widely used tool with known limitations rather than obsolete [^111CDDqh] [^116f9WK1].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line. The Sokolow-Lyon index is a specific but insensitive screening test for LVH. Obesity substantially attenuates voltages and can be partially corrected with simple BMI adjustments, sex and race influence distributions and performance, and serial change in voltage during therapy carries prognostic information, so best practice is to apply the criterion thoughtfully, combine with other ECG indices when appropriate, and escalate to echocardiography when results will alter management or when clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative ECG [^113eTc79] [^113sz4Qy] [^112e5oBM] [^114BEbbc].

---

The Sokolow-Lyon criterion is a simple, widely used ECG index for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), defined as **SV1 + RV5/RV6 ≥ 35 mm** [^114BEbbc]. It has high specificity but low sensitivity [^116S1EnL], especially in obesity [^113sz4Qy] and women, so a negative result does not exclude LVH [^114BEbbc]. The criterion is **prognostically meaningful** [^112e5oBM], with higher voltages linked to increased cardiovascular risk [^117Tffdn], and regression of voltage during therapy tracks improved outcomes [^112zqdf7]. For higher sensitivity, combine with Cornell criteria [^114ohsh5] or adjust for BMI (+4 mm if overweight, +8 mm if obese) [^113sz4Qy] [^113RarbY].

---

## Definition and calculation

The Sokolow-Lyon index is calculated as the **sum of the S-wave amplitude in lead V1 and the R-wave amplitude in lead V5 or V6 (whichever is larger)** [^116fcVqc]. LVH is suggested when the sum is **≥ 35 mm (3.5 mV)** [^114BEbbc].

---

## Clinical significance

LVH is a **strong independent risk factor** for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [^112e5oBM]. The Sokolow-Lyon criterion is a simple, non-invasive tool for detecting LVH and stratifying cardiovascular risk in hypertensive and other high-risk populations [^114BEbbc].

---

## Diagnostic performance

The Sokolow-Lyon criterion has **high specificity** (approximately 85–95%) but **low sensitivity** (approximately 20–50%) [^116fcVqc] for detecting echocardiographically confirmed LVH [^116W8EEY]. Sensitivity is particularly limited in obese individuals [^113sz4Qy] due to attenuation of ECG voltages by increased chest wall and pericardial fat [^113zeUN6].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors limit the **accuracy** of the Sokolow-Lyon criterion:

- **Obesity**: Reduces ECG voltages, decreasing sensitivity [^113sz4Qy] [^115rMxTx].
- **Body habitus**: Thoracic cage size and shape affect voltage amplitudes [^116fcVqc].
- **Age and sex**: Younger individuals and males typically have higher voltages, potentially causing false positives [^116fcVqc].
- **Ethnicity**: African American individuals often have higher QRS voltages, affecting specificity [^111wNxzG].

---

## Prognostic value

The Sokolow-Lyon criterion has significant prognostic value: **higher baseline voltages** are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [^117Tffdn], and **regression of voltage** during antihypertensive therapy correlates with improved cardiovascular outcomes [^112e5oBM] [^112zqdf7].

---

## Comparison with other ECG criteria

| **Criterion** | **Definition** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sokolow-Lyon | SV1 + RV5/RV6 ≥ 35 mm | Low (20–50%) | High (85–95%) |
| Cornell voltage | SV3 + RaVL ≥ 28 mm (men) ≥ 20 mm (women) | Moderate (30–60%) | High (85–95%) |
| Cornell product | (SV3 + RaVL) × QRS duration ≥ 2440 mm·ms | Moderate (40–60%) | High (85–95%) |

---

Combining the Sokolow-Lyon criterion with other ECG criteria (e.g. Cornell voltage) **improves sensitivity** without significantly compromising specificity [^117UYkKD] [^112QDK8g].

---

## Recent modifications and adjustments

Recent studies propose **BMI-adjusted thresholds** to improve sensitivity in obese individuals: add 4 mm if overweight and 8 mm if obese [^113sz4Qy] [^113RarbY]. These adjustments increase sensitivity to approximately 30–40% while maintaining high specificity [^115Z2EDd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend using the Sokolow-Lyon criterion as part of routine ECG assessment in hypertensive patients [^114BEbbc], but emphasize that **ECG cannot exclude LVH** due to low sensitivity [^114BEbbc]. Echocardiography is recommended when detailed cardiac structural information is needed [^114BEbbc].

---

## Clinical applications and implications

The Sokolow-Lyon criterion is widely used in clinical practice for:

- **Screening**: Detecting LVH in hypertensive and high-risk populations [^114BEbbc].
- **Risk stratification**: Identifying patients at increased cardiovascular risk [^112e5oBM].
- **Monitoring**: Assessing regression or progression of LVH during antihypertensive therapy [^1112QWDp].

---

## Conclusion

The **Sokolow-Lyon criterion** is a simple, specific, and widely used ECG index for detecting LVH and stratifying cardiovascular risk. Despite its **low sensitivity**, particularly in obese individuals, it remains valuable, especially when combined with other ECG criteria or adjusted for BMI [^113sz4Qy]. Its **prognostic significance** and ease of use ensure continued relevance in clinical practice [^112e5oBM].

### Implication of different ECG left ventricular hypertrophy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1138XUV1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Various ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have been proposed, but their association with clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement is unknown. We investigated the prevalence of ECG LVH according to different criteria and its prognostic impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Methods and Results In this prospective observational cohort, we evaluated 700 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement between March 2010 and December 2019. Baseline preprocedural LVH was defined by 3 ECG criteria-Sokolow-Lyon, Romhilt-Estes, and Cornell voltage criteria. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE; composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or rehospitalization from cardiovascular cause); the key secondary outcome was all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Among 596 eligible patients, the prevalence of LVH was determined as 56.3% by Sokolow-Lyon, 31.1% by Romhilt-Estes, and 48.1% by Cornell criteria. Regardless of the criteria, patients with ECG LVH had more severe aortic stenosis hemodynamics and higher left ventricular mass index. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of LVH by the Cornell criteria was significantly associated with lower risks of MACCE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.91; P = 0.009), all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34–0.90 [P = 0.017]), and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20–0.79 [P = 0.008]). However, this association was absent with the Sokolow-Lyon and Romhilt-Estes criteria. Conclusions ECG LVH by Cornell criteria only was significantly associated with lower risks of MACCE and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^116n6CHM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Electrocardiogram and criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy

LVH was determined by means of Gubner‐Ungerleider voltage, Levis voltage, voltage of R wave in aVL lead (positive > 1.1 mV), Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage and Cornell product, voltage RV 6 and RV 5 ratio (positive > 1), Romhilt‐Estes score, Framingham criterion, and Perugia criterion (electrocardiograph EKG‐300, EI Nis). Additionally, Gubner‐Ungerleider voltage as RD 1 + SD 3 ≥ 2.5 mV, and Lewis voltage as (RD 1 + SD 3) — (SD 1 + RD 3) ≥ 1.7 mV were used for confirming LVH. Positive Lyon‐Sokolow voltage was defined as SV 1 + RV 5 or V 6 ≥ 3.5 mV, or in accordance with European Society of Cardiology Guidelines Committee as ≥ 3.8 mV. 9 In line with Cornell voltage criteria, the presence of LVH was defined as SV 3 + RaVL > 2.0 for women and > 2.8 for men. Positive Cornell product was defined as SV 3 + RaVL × QRS duration ≥ 244 mV × ms. Left ventricular strain was defined as ST‐segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV plus T‐wave asymmetric inversion in V 2 to V 6 and in peripheral leads (lateral or inferior). Framingham criterion was positive if left ventricular (LV) strain plus ≥ 1 voltage criterion (RaVL > 1.1 mV, RD 1 + SD 3 ≥ 2.5 mV, SV 1 or V 2 + RV 5 or V 6 ≥ 3.5 mV, SV 1 or V 2 ≥ 2.5 mV, RV 5 or V 6 ≥ 2.5 mV). Perugia criterion was positive if SV 3 + RaVL > 2.4 mV (men), > 2.0 mV (women), and/or LV strain, and/or Romhilt‐Estes score ≥ 5. Positive Romhilt‐Estes score was defined as ≥ 5 points and calculated from six ECG features with a specific value of points for each feature: R or S wave in any limb lead ≥ 2.0 mV or S wave in V 1 or V 2 ≥ 3.0 mV or R wave in V 5 or V 6 ≥ 3.0 mV (three points); P‐terminal force defined as terminal negativity of P wave in V 1 ≥ 0.10 mV in depth and ≥ 0.04 ms in duration (three points); LV strain defined as ST segment and T wave in opposite direction to QRS in V 5 or V 6, without digitalis (three points); left axis deviation defined as QRS axis less than or equal to −30° (two points); QRS duration ≥ 0.09 ms (one point); and intrinsicoid deflection in V 5 or V 6 ≥ 0.05 ms (one point). 10

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^113zeUN6]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

As electrocardiographic determination of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not costly, is simple to perform and yields indices linked to mortality, it is widely used in clinical practice and appears in international guidelines. As a result, the electrocardiogram (ECG) remains, worldwide, the most commonly used screening tool.

The two most commonly used ECG criteria are the Sokolow–Lyon indexand the Cornell criteria. Despite their routine clinical use, the diagnostic accuracy of these surface ECG criteria is limited, with poor sensitivity for the detection of LVH. Indeed, the original authors of the Sokolow–Lyon index report only a 32% sensitivity, making its uptake into clinical practice and its continued use surprising. Obesity, which is now pandemic in the Western world, results in three distinct processes that affect the surface ECG — lateral displacement of the anatomical left ventricular (LV) axis, increased chest wall fat and increased pericardial fat mass, all of which decrease voltage amplitude on the ECG. This reduces the diagnostic sensitivity of the surface ECG even further and is likely to render ECG criteria generated in a society with a much lower body mass index (BMI) (∼20 kg/m 2 in 1949)to be obsolete in the modern age of obesity, where LVH is increasingly seen.

Although previous attempts have been made at improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG by adjusting for body habitus, they have either relied on echocardiographic determination of LV mass, which is severely limited in obesity, or have not taken into account the anatomical LV axis deviation that accompanies obesity. Furthermore, although all report diagnostic performance improvement, these studies all implemented complex statistical modelling to derive adjustment formula that could be applied to the ECG to adjust for obesity. Hence, they are not practical to perform as a quick screening tool and have failed to enter routine clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to develop a simple BMI-based adjustment factor for the ECG that could be used in everyday clinical practice to improve diagnostic accuracy of the detection of LVH in the modern population, where obesity is increasingly prevalent.

### ECG detection of left ventricular hypertrophy: the simpler, the better? [^114SuN3G]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

ECG is commonly employed to identify left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a high risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) in hypertensive patients. However, the multiplicity of the existing criteria does not simplify interpretation of the data. We compared a number of common criteria in hypertensive patients by taking as references left ventricular mass (LVM) measured by echocardiography and prediction of incident CVE.

Methods

The population was a cohort of 958 hypertensive patients (mean age 48 years) recruited before any treatment and having benefited from an ECG and an echocardiography. We evaluated their outcomes at regular intervals. We examined the relationships between several ECG criteria of LVH and LVM as well the occurrence of CVE.

Results

Among the various parameters tested (Sokoloff, Cornell, Cornell product) the simple measurement of the RaVL wave offered the best correlations to LVM and the best prediction of the existence of an echocardiographic LVH (receiver-operating characteristic curves). Its alterations were best correlated with the changes in LVM during the follow-up period. Moreover, this simple measurement offered the best performance for the prediction of the occurrence of CVE (123 events after a mean lapse of 12 years).

Conclusion

In the interpretation of an ECG in the hypertensive patient, the single measurement of the R wave in aVL gives results at least as good as those of more complicated indices, which do not appear to contribute further to the diagnosis of LVH and the prediction of cardiovascular risk.

### Novel approach to the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy using body mass index-corrected electrocardiographic voltage criteria in a group of African ancestry [^1111hNjD]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Electrocardiographic (ECG) QRS voltages used to generate criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) detection are considerably attenuated by obesity. This effect renders the utility of ECG criteria to detect LVH in obese individuals of African ancestry to be of limited value.

Hypothesis

A novel approach to correcting QRS voltages for the attenuating effect of body mass index (BMI) will improve the ability of ECG criteria to detect LVH in a group of African descent.

Methods

Left ventricular mass was determined from echocardiography in 661 randomly selected participants (43.0% obese) of black African ancestry in South Africa.

Results

As compared with Cornell and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria, BMI best correlated with RaVL, Gubner-Ungerleider, and Lewis QRS complex voltages, but these relations were noted only in those with BMI < 29 kg/m(2). Correcting RaVL and Lewis voltages by the difference in the slope of BMI-voltage relations in those with BMI < 29 kg/m(2) vs those with BMI ≥ 29 kg/m(2) showed the greatest performance for LVH detection (uncorrected RaVL: 0.695 ± 0.025, corrected RaVL: 0.733 ± 0.022; P < 0.0001), and also increased the sensitivity (uncorrected RaVL: 30.6%, corrected RaVL: 42.4%; P < 0.0005) with no significant change in specificity (uncorrected RaVL: 86.3%, corrected RaVL: 83.0%; P = 0.28).

Conclusions

We offer a novel approach to correcting ECG voltages for the attenuating effects of obesity in individuals of African ancestry, and this improves the performance and sensitivity for LVH detection.

### Screening for left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the community [^112VEDs3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and is common among patients with type 2 diabetes. However, no systematic screening for LVH is currently recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NT-proBNP was superior to 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for detection of LVH in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Prospective cross-sectional study comparing diagnostic accuracy of ECG and NT-proBNP for the detection of LVH among patients with type 2 diabetes. Inclusion criteria included having been diagnosed for > 5 years and/or on treatment for type 2 diabetes; patients with Stage 3/4 chronic kidney disease and known cardiovascular disease were excluded. ECG LVH was defined as either the Sokolow-Lyon or Cornell voltage criteria. NT-proBNP level was measured using the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys assay. Left ventricular mass was assessed from echocardiography. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.

Results

294 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited, mean age 58 (SD 11) years, BP 134/81 ± 18/11 mmHg, HbA 1c 7.3 ± 1.5%. LVH was present in 164 patients (56%). In a logistic regression model age, gender, BMI and a history of hypertension were important determinants of LVH (p < 0.05). Only 5 patients with LVH were detected by either ECG voltage criteria. The AUC for NT-proBNP in detecting LVH was 0.68.

Conclusions

LVH was highly prevalent in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. ECG was an inadequate test to identify LVH and while NT-proBNP was superior to ECG it remained unsuitable for detecting LVH. Thus, there remains a need for a screening tool to detect LVH in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes to enhance risk stratification and management.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram as a predictor of success in home blood pressure control: HOMED-BP study [^112tRvem]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Few studies have focused on the effect of organ damage on achievement of long-term home blood pressure (BP) control. Based on the nationwide home BP-based trial data, we aimed to investigate the factors associated with home BP control, in particular, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) using the electrocardiogram in patients who started antihypertensive drug treatment. According to the trial protocol, we defined BP as controlled when systolic home BP reached specified targets (125–134mmHg in usual control (UC), n = 1261; < 125mmHg in tight control (TC), n = 1288). At baseline, before drug treatment started, the mean Sokolow-Lyon voltage was 2.57 ± 0.87mV, and the mean Cornell product was 1573 ± 705mm·ms. The numbers of patients who achieved the target BP level in the UC and TC groups were 892 (70.7%) and 576 (44.7%), respectively. In both the UC and TC groups, systolic home BP at baseline was significantly lower in patients who achieved target levels than in those who did not achieve target levels (P < 0.0001). Sokolow-Lyon voltage was significantly lower in patients who achieved target levels than in those who did not (P ≤ 0.0055). The Cornell product levels in each group were similar (P⩾0.12), although significantly different between patients who did or did not achieve the target level when the UC and TC groups were combined for analysis (P = 0.031). Sokolow-Lyon voltage was significantly associated with achievement of home BP control in the multivariable-adjusted model (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence intervals, 1.02–1.26; P = 0.015), but Cornell product was not (P = 0.13). These results indicate the difficulty of sufficient antihypertensive treatment when untreated patients had target organ damage, that is, LVH diagnosed by Sokolow-Lyon voltage.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^112QDK8g]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies often focused on the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of single ECG criterion. Our current study found that any of the 4 ECG criteria including the Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had a relatively higher sensitivity than each ECG criterion alone, without apparent compromise in specificity. These 4 ECG criteria are most commonly used with convenient acquisition by ECG devices and recommended by the European hypertension guideline. If applied properly and widely, this combined 4 ECG criteria approach might improve LVH screen in patients with hypertension.

Our study should be interpreted within the context of its limitations. First, our study examined only 7 of the numerous ECG criteria. Second, our study was a single center one. Most of our patients were from Shanghai or the nearby eastern China provinces. Our study therefore might be less representative than a multicenter study. Nonetheless, the current study built the ground for future studies on possible new ECG LVH diagnostic criteria in the Chinese or Asian population.

In conclusion, if the same cutoff values would be used in Chinese, the ECG criteria had high specificity but low sensitivity for the diagnosis of LVH, regardless of the pattern of LVH. Any of the 4 ECG criteria including the Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage, instead of a single ECG criterion, may have to be considered for the diagnosis of LVH in Chinese hypertensive patients.

### Implication of different ECG left ventricular hypertrophy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^113wJgDX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases in the elderly population, and its prevalence is rapidly increasing as a result of population aging. Typically, AS progressively increases left ventricular (LV) afterload, which leads to the development of LV hypertrophy (LVH) to reduce wall stress and maintain cardiac function. This LVH process can be compensatory in the early stages; however, progressive LVH can become maladaptive and myocardium can progress to cell death and fibrosis, thus leading to symptom development, systolic dysfunction, and cardiac remodeling, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

LVH can be diagnosed by ECG or anatomical methods (ie, echocardiography). Although anatomic LVH diagnosed by echocardiography is currently the gold standard, ECG LVH and echocardiographic LVH are regarded to be clinically distinct entities. It has also been recognized that abnormal ECG LVH changes can precede pathological echocardiographic LVH, and that electrical alterations provide additional clinical information to the imaging of the cardiac structure and function.

Several studies of patients with AS undergoing surgical aortic valve (AV) replacement have shown conflicting results in terms of the association between the presence of LVH and clinical outcomes. Also, recent studies showed mixed findings regarding the association of LVH and clinical outcomes in patients with severe AS undergoing transcatheter AV replacement (TAVR). Several ECG criteria have been proposed to diagnose the presence of LVH, but the prevalence of baseline LVH according to the ECG criteria and their prognostic impact on clinical outcomes and mortality after TAVR are unknown. In the present study, we thus evaluated the associations between the presence of ECG LVH as assessed by the most commonly used 3 LVH criteria (the Sokolow‐Lyon criteria, the Romhilt‐Estes point score, and the Cornell voltage criteria) and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR for severe AS.

### Relation of echocardiographic left ventricular mass and hypertrophy to persistent electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients: the LIFE study [^115VwNot]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial used left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on a screening ECG to identify patients at high risk for morbid events. Because of regression to the mean, not all patients who met screening criteria had persistent ECG LVH on the ECG performed at study baseline.

Methods

The relationship of echocardiographic LV mass and LVH to persistence or loss of ECG LVH between screening and baseline evaluation was examined in 906 hypertensive patients in the LIFE study, who had echocardiograms and additional ECG performed at study baseline. Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria; echocardiographic LVH was defined by LV mass index (LVMI) > 104 g/m² in women and > 116 g/m² in men.

Results

A total of 678 patients (75%) had persistent ECG LVH at baseline evaluation. Compared with the 228 patients without ECG LVH on the second ECG by either criterion, the 106 patients with LVH by both Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon criteria had significantly higher LVMI (140 ± 31 v 114 ± 21 g/m2, P < .001) and a higher prevalence of echocardiographic LVH (86% v 55%, P < .001). Patients with ECG LVH on the baseline ECG by either Cornell product criteria (n = 410) or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria (n = 162) had intermediate values of LVMI (125 ± 25 and 121 ± 21 g/m2) and prevalences of echocardiographic LVH (78% and 62%). After controlling for possible effects of age, sex, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, persistence of ECG LVH on the baseline ECG was associated with an increased risk of echocardiographic LVH: compared with patients with neither ECG criteria for LVH, patients with only Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria had a 1.2-fold increased risk of echocardiographic LVH, those with only Cornell product criteria had a 2.7-fold increased risk, and patients with both ECG criteria had a 4.1-fold increased risk of echocardiographic LVH (P < .001).

Conclusions

Persistent ECG LVH between screening and LIFE study baseline identified patients with greater LV mass and a higher prevalence of echocardiographic LVH, suggesting that these patients may be at higher risk for subsequent morbid and mortal events.

### The clinical value of apex beat and electrocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy from the standpoint of the distance factors from the heart to the chest wall: a multislice CT study [^116vLxXC]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate simultaneously the clinical value of the apex beat and the two major ECG voltage criteria applied to detect increased LV mass while taking the distance factors from the heart to the chest wall into consideration. This study has two major novel findings. First, the distance to the inner chest wall was negatively correlated with measurements of the heart size, such as EDV index and LV mass index. In contrast, the distance to the chest surface was correlated with the body size, such as BMI. Second, the pattern of sustained or double apical impulse showed a stronger association with the distance to the inner chest wall than to the chest surface; however, the Sokolow–Lyon voltage was associated with the distance to the chest surface. Neither the distance to the inner chest wall nor to the chest surface was associated with the Cornell voltage. That is, it is likely that the apex beat may be directly affected by the heart size, and that Sokolow–Lyon voltage may be more strongly affected by the body size. These findings may partly explain why the pattern of sustained or double apical impulse has higher sensitivity and specificity as an indicator of LVH than Sokolow–Lyon voltage.

### Accuracy of electrocardiography in diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in arterial hypertension: systematic review [^113eTc79]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the accuracy of electrocardiography in screening for left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.

Design

Systematic review of studies of test accuracy of six electrocardiographic indexes: the Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage index, Cornell product index, Gubner index, and Romhilt-Estes scores with thresholds for a positive test of ≥ 4 points or ≥ 5 points.

Data Sources

Electronic databases ((Pre-)Medline, Embase), reference lists of relevant studies and previous reviews, and experts.

Study Selection

Two reviewers scrutinised abstracts and examined potentially eligible studies. Studies comparing the electrocardiographic index with echocardiography in hypertensive patients and reporting sufficient data were included.

Data Extraction

Data on study populations, echocardiographic criteria, and methodological quality of studies were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Negative likelihood ratios, which indicate to what extent the posterior odds of left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced by a negative test, were calculated.

Results

21 studies and data on 5608 patients were analysed. The median prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 33% (interquartile range 23–41%) in primary care settings (10 studies) and 65% (37–81%) in secondary care settings (11 studies). The median negative likelihood ratio was similar across electrocardiographic indexes, ranging from 0.85 (range 0.34–1.03) for the Romhilt-Estes score (with threshold ≥ 4 points) to 0.91 (0.70–1.01) for the Gubner index. Using the Romhilt-Estes score in primary care, a negative electrocardiogram result would reduce the typical pre-test probability from 33% to 31%. In secondary care the typical pre-test probability of 65% would be reduced to 63%.

Conclusion

Electrocardiographic criteria should not be used to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114BEbbc]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension-mediated organ damage — electrocardiogram and echocardiography: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be part of the routine assessment in all hypertensive patients, and the ECG cannot exclude left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) because it has poor sensitivity; when detailed information on cardiac structure and function will influence treatment decisions, echocardiography is recommended. Electrocardiogram LVH definitions use the following cut-offs: Sokolow–Lyon criterion > 35 mm; R wave in aVL ≥ 11 mm; Cornell voltage > 28 mm (men) and > 20 mm (women); and Cornell duration product > 2440 mm·ms.

### The effect of obesity on electrocardiographic detection of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy: recalibration against cardiac magnetic resonance [^111MQAp4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings of significantly reduced ECG sensitivity and specificity at detecting LVH in the presence of obesity suggest that a normal ECG in an obese hypertensive patient has a higher chance of being both falsely reassuring for the absence of LVH and falsely positive in obese compared with non-obese subjects. Failing to identify or exclude LVH may alter an individual's cardiovascular risk estimate and therefore may have treatment implications. Our obesity-specific partition values may help to readdress this issue. At a fixed 95% specificity, sensitivity was inferior for obese subjects compared with non-obese subjects for all criteria except Sokolow–Lyon voltage and Sokolow–Lyon product. Sensitivity and specificity need to be interpreted in the context of the disease prevalence and these results are likely related to the relatively low prevalence of ECG LVH with the Sokolow–Lyon voltage and product criteria (Table 2). The lower prevalence of ECG LVH with these criteria is consistent with previous work from Okin et al. The best sensitivity for non-obese subjects (56%) was achieved with the Cornell voltage criterion, which is consistent with a previous study by Molloy et al.who demonstrated a sensitivity of 50% for the Cornell product criterion for antemortem ECG compared with LVM measured by dry weight at autopsy. The optimal sensitivity for obese subjects was achieved with the Sokolow–Lyon product, using an amended partition value of ⩾3275 mm
- ms compared with the conventional ⩾3710 mV ms −1.

### Electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in children [^113678DU]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

We performed the first large study on the validity of ECG criteria for detecting LVH in an unselected pediatric hospital population with up-to-date reference standards for both electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. The unreliability of reference standards for both the ECG criteria and the echocardiographic-based criteria may previously have been accountable for the disappointing performance of the ECG. Rivenes et al. demonstrated that the often used standard of normal ECG limits of Davignon et al. needed to be revised. They derived new age-adjusted reference values for their HIV-uninfected group of children < 6 years old. With these new normal values the sensitivity decreased slightly (from < 20% to < 17%) while the specificity improved (from 88%–92% to 94%–100%). Regarding the echocardiogram, a recent study provided echocardiographic dimensions that differed significantly from previous data, probably owing to improved measuring techniques.

The sensitivity of the ECG for detecting LVH in children is relatively low when LVM+ is taken as the LVH definition (Table 3). The best single parameter is (SV3R + RV7), with a sensitivity of 25.3% at 95% specificity. Notably, SV3R, RV7, and (SV3R + RV7) perform better than SV1, RV6, and (SV1 + RV6), respectively. The best-performing parameter that uses leads from the standard 12-lead ECG is the voltage-time integral version of the Sokolow-Lyon criterion, with a sensitivity of 24.4%. Further, the use of voltage-duration product and voltage-time integral of the 12-lead sum resulted in higher sensitivities than the amplitude-only version in the total population. However, overall the use of voltage-duration products and voltage-time integrals for the diagnosis of LVH remains less effective than in adults.

### Combining ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy improves risk prediction in patients with hypertension [^114ohsh5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The well‐recognized limited sensitivity of any one ECG LVH criterion as compared with imaging modalities has been put forward as a limitation of ECG‐dependent approaches to LVH diagnosis, 21 despite findings that imaging and ECG methods appear to similarly track prognosis 17, 21, 22 and may provide complimentary information. 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Based on the limited sensitivity of single ECG criteria, investigators have demonstrated that using both Cornell product (CP) and Sokolow‐Lyon voltage (SL) duration criteria together can increase sensitivity and population prevalence for detection of echocardiographic LVH, albeit with some loss of specificity 29, 30 and that the presence of both of these criteria on ECG was associated with higher left ventricular (LV) mass index and a greater prevalence of echocardiographic LVH than either criterion alone or neither. 31 The finding that different ECG LVH criteria identify different populations of patients at potentially increased risk 16, 29, 30, 31 and the additive value of ECG and imaging‐based LVH for risk stratification 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 suggests an opportunity to better track risk by combining 2 ECG LVH criteria with complimentary prognostic power. In this scenario, it might be predicted that the mutual absence of LVH by both criteria would be associated with the lowest risk, the presence of LVH by both criteria with the highest risk, and the presence of LVH by one or the other with intermediate risk. The LIFE (Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction) study 17, 18, 19, 20 recruited patients with ECG LVH by either CP and/or SL before enrollment, tracked the magnitude of ECG LVH by both criteria throughout follow‐up, and demonstrated that on‐treatment CP and SL criteria separately predicted cardiovascular risk but did not examine whether combining the 2 ECG LVH criteria could improve risk stratification. Therefore, the present post hoc analysis of data from the LIFE study was undertaken to examine whether the continued presence or new development of ECG LVH by both CP and SL was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality compared with continued absence or regression of ECG LVH by both of these criteria, and whether the presence or development of LVH by either CP or SL is associated with intermediate elevation of risk.

### Regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive treatment and the prediction of major cardiovascular events [^112e5oBM]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. However, the predictive value of changes in the magnitude of electrocardiographic LVH criteria during antihypertensive therapy remains unclear.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that lesser severity of electrocardiographic LVH during antihypertensive treatment is associated with decreased CV morbidity and mortality, independent of blood pressure levels and reduction and treatment modality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in 1995–2001 among 9193 men and women with hypertension aged 55 through 80 years (mean, 67 years), with electrocardiographic LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria and enrolled in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study.

Interventions

Losartan- or atenolol-based treatment regimens, with follow-up assessments for at least 4 (mean, 4.8 [SD, 0.9]) years.

Main Outcome Measure

Composite end point of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in relation to severity of electrocardiographic LVH determined at baseline and on subsequent electrocardiograms obtained at 1 or more annual revisits.

Results

Cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or stroke occurred in 1096 patients (11.9%). In Cox regression models controlling for treatment type, baseline Framingham risk score, baseline and in-treatment blood pressure, and severity of baseline electrocardiographic LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage, less-severe in-treatment LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage were associated with 14% and 17% lower rates, respectively, of the composite CV end point (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–0.90; P < .001 for every 1050-mm x ms [1-SD] decrease in Cornell product; and HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78–0.88; P < .001 for every 10.5-mm [1-SD] decrease in Sokolow-Lyon voltage). In parallel analyses, lower Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage were each independently associated with lower risks of CV mortality (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73–0.83; P < .001; and HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.87; P < .001, respectively), MI (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.98; p = 0.01; and HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00; p = 0.04), and stroke (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.96; p = 0.002; and HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89; P < .001).

Conclusions

Less-severe electrocardiographic LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria during antihypertensive therapy is associated with lower likelihoods of CV morbidity and mortality, independent of blood pressure lowering and treatment modality in persons with essential hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy targeted at regression or prevention of electrocardiographic LVH may improve prognosis.

### Obesity markedly attenuates the validity and performance of all electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy detection in a group of black African ancestry [^117K3oRb]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the impact of obesity on the validity and performance of electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in a group of participants of black African ancestry with a high prevalence of obesity.

Methods

Electrocardiographic voltage criteria for the detection of echocardiographic LVH [left ventricular mass index (LVMI) > 51 g/m²·⁷] were evaluated in 661 participants from a community sample of black African ancestry (43% obese).

Results

BMI was inversely associated with Sokolow-Lyon voltages (partial r = -0.27, P < 0.0001) and no BMI-Cornell voltage relations were noted (P = 0.21). BMI was associated with voltage criteria that incorporate only limb lead recordings (r = 0.17–0.23), but these relations were weaker than BMI-LVMI relations (r = 0.36, P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001 for comparisons of r values). All electrocardiographic criteria were as strongly related to blood pressure as LVMI. Sokolow-Lyon voltage-LVMI relations were noted only after adjustments for BMI (P < 0.02) and Sokolow-Lyon voltages showed no performance for LVH detection. Cornell voltages showed significant performance in nonobese [area under receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.67 ± 0.04, P < 0.0005], but not in obese (AUC = 0.56 ± 0.04, P = 0.08). Electrocardiographic criteria which employ limb-lead recordings only (e.g. RaVL) showed better performance in nonobese than in obese (AUC = 0.75 ± 0.04 and 0.59 ± 0.04, respectively, P < 0.005 for comparison) and markedly reduced specificity for LVH detection in obese (76%) than in nonobese (92%, P < 0.0001) despite similar sensitivities (32 vs. 29%).

Conclusion

In groups of black African ancestry, obesity contributes to a poor validity and performance of all voltage criteria for the detection of LVH. None of the current criteria are recommended for use in obesity.

### Comparison of usefulness of sokolow and cornell criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in subjects aged 30 years [^111DtyQz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The use of electrocardiography in sports or military screening is considered an effective tool for diagnosing potentially fatal conditions. The present study was designed to compare the yield of electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) criteria for the diagnosis of LVH and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in subjects aged < 20 years and > 30 years. The association between the electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for LVH (ECG-LVH) and echocardiographic findings was compared in 4 groups of air force academy candidates: (1) young candidates undergoing echocardiography because of ECG-LVH findings (n = 666); (2) young candidates without ECG-LVH findings undergoing routine echocardiography (n = 4,043); (3) older designated aviators undergoing echocardiography because of ECG-LVH findings (n = 196); and (4) older designated aviators undergoing routine echocardiography without ECG-LVH findings (n = 1,098). The predictive value of ECG-LVH findings for echocardiographic LVH, left ventricular mass, posterior wall thickness, and interventricular septal thickness were compared among the 4 groups. The ECG criteria in young subjects correlated with the left ventricular mass and posterior wall thickness but not with the interventricular septal thickness. In older subjects, these criteria correlated with left ventricular mass, interventricular septal, and posterior wall thickness. The positive and negative predictive value of ECG-LVH findings for the echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH in young subjects was 6.0% and 99.0%, respectively. In older subjects the positive and negative predictive value of ECG-LVH findings was 34% and 93%, respectively. In conclusion, ECG criteria are probably a useful tool for exclusion of LVH in young and older subjects; however, their low positive predictive value would probably lead to unnecessary echocardiographic tests, particularly in young subjects.

### Obesity and ECG left ventricular hypertrophy [^112eS6uG]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and the prognostic significance for fatal and nonfatal cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events of different ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in normal weight, overweight and obese patients in an adult Italian population.

Methods

A total of 18330 adults (mean age 54 ± 11 years, 55% women, 53% hypertensive patients) were analyzed from the Moli-sani cohort. Obesity was defined using the ATPIII criteria. ECG-LVH was defined according to 2013 ESC-ESH guidelines.

Results

The age and sex adjusted prevalence of ECG-LVH did not differ from normal weight patients to class 1–3 obesity patients, when Cornell-voltage criterion was used. In overweight and obese patients, as compared with normal weight patients, a progressively lower prevalence of ECG-LVH was observed when the Sokolow-Lyon index was used, whereas a higher prevalence was shown by using the aVL R-wave voltage (> 11 and > 5.7mm) and the Cornell-voltage-QRS duration product. The incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly greater in patients with ECG LVH diagnosis by the Cornell voltage [hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–3.39] and the Cornell product (hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.31–2.67). After adjusting for different confounders (age, sex, cigarette, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, income, education, occupational class and physical activity) and for BMI categories, only the Cornell product remained significantly associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% CI 1.16–2.38). The predictive significance of different LVH criteria was assessed across BMI categories; after adjusting for confounders, no LVH criteria were significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in obese patients; Cornell-product LVH remained an independent predictor of events in normal weight and overweight individuals (hazard ratio 2.63; 95% CI 1.10–6.28 and hazard ratio 2.72; 95% CI 1.52–4.25, respectively).

Conclusion

Our results confirm that ECG LVH prevalence may differ according to the criteria used across BMI categories in a low cardiovascular risk cohort. The use of different LVH criteria according to BMI categories may improve cardiovascular risk stratification in a general population independently of several confounding factors.

### Optimized electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity patients [^116XyTmm]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

All adjusted criteria in our study had better sensitivities in males than in females. This difference is possibly because of the abundant breast tissue in obese women, 26 which may also explain why the Cornell voltage performed relatively poor in women (Table 3). The positioning of lead V3, an important lead for the Cornell voltage, is usually on a location of relatively plentiful breast tissue as compared to the position of V1 and V5 used for the Sokolow‐Lyon index, which appeared to be the best performing criterion in female obesity patients. An explanation could also be that in general women have a smaller LVM (in our obese population 175 ± 48 g in females vs 252 ± 72 g in males, P < .001) leading to smaller S wave amplitude in V3, which measures posteriorly directed myocardial electrical activity. 9, 27

Finally, it may seem difficult to implement our proposed criteria into daily practice since, apart from the necessity to assess BMI, it would require the use of different criteria in males and females. However, nowadays ECG devices already use programmed algorithms for standard interpretation. It will be a relatively minor issue to add our proposed new criteria to these modern devices, allowing easy clinical use without extra effort.

### Impact of left ventricular hypertrophy on QT prolongation and associated mortality [^114Jv9pc]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

QT prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG) is a risk marker of ventricular arrhythmias and all-cause mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on ECG is also associated with poor outcome. Patients satisfying ECG voltage criteria for LVH frequently show concomitant QT prolongation.

Objective

This study aimed to explore the impact of marked QT prolongation on all-cause mortality in patients copresenting with LVH voltage criteria and prolonged QT on ECG.

Methods

We evaluated 3364 ECGs with corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥ 460 ms detected by Mayo Clinic's QT alert system from November 2010 through June 2011. Every ECG with QTc interval ≥ 460 ms was evaluated for the presence of LVH voltage criteria by using Sokolow-Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, and Cornell product.

Results

Concomitant LVH voltage criteria were present in 181 of 3364 ECGs (5.3%) with QTc interval ≥ 460 ms. Mortality during a follow-up period of 217 ± 184 days was 13% (23 of 181). Independent of age and hypertension, the QTc interval predicted mortality in patients with LVH voltage criteria (hazard ratio 1.31 per 10-ms increase; 95% confidence interval 1.09–1.58; P < .01). Patients with LVH voltage criteria and QTc interval ≥ 500 ms had highest mortality (log rank, P < .001).

Conclusion

The QTc interval was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with concomitant LVH voltage and prolonged QTc interval on ECG. Mortality was highest in those with QTc interval ≥ 500 ms. QT prolongation on ECGs with concomitant LVH voltage criteria should not be regarded as a harmless byproduct of LVH, but should be used as a significant marker of increased mortality risk similar to that in patients without LVH voltage criteria.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^115rMxTx]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Obesity influences electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria performance for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); in mild or moderate hypertension, the Cornell voltage-duration product was more often in the LVH range in obese than nonobese patients, whereas the Sokolow-Lyon criterion was less often in the LVH range in obese patients.

### New gender-specific partition values for ECG criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy: recalibration against cardiac MRI [^114nU3Lw]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were mostly validated using left ventricular mass (LVM) as measured by M-mode echocardiography. LVM as measured by cardiac MRI has been demonstrated to be much more accurate and reproducible. We reevaluated the sensitivity and specificity of 4 ECG criteria of LVH against LVM as measured by cardiac MRI. Patients with systemic hypertension (n = 288) and 60 normal volunteers had their LVM measured using a 1.5-Tesla MRI system. A 12-lead ECG was recorded, and 4 ECG criteria were evaluated: Sokolow-Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and Sokolow-Lyon product. Based on a cardiac MRI normal range, 39.9% of the hypertensive males and 36.7% of the hypertensive females had elevated LVM index. At a specificity of 95%, the Sokolow-Lyon product criterion had the highest sensitivity in females (26.2%), the Cornell criterion had the highest sensitivity in males (26.2%), and the Cornell product criteria had a relatively high sensitivity in both males and females (25.0% and 23.8%). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed the Cornell and Cornell product criteria to be superior for males whereas the Sokolow-Lyon product criterion was superior for females. Comparing the mean LVM index values of the subjects who were ECG LVH positive to the normal volunteers indicated that the ECG LVH criteria detect individuals with an LVM index substantially above the normal range. We have redefined the partition values for 4 different ECG LVH criteria, according to gender, and found that they detect subjects with markedly elevated LVM index.

### Reliability of electrocardiographic surrogates of left ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113qu7cU]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a prevalent condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) very often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. Electrocardiography (ECG) is an easily accessible LVH diagnostic tool. We evaluated the usefulness of commonly applied ECG criteria for LVH diagnosis in CKD patients.

Methods

Cross-sectional evaluation of 253 nondialysis-dependent CKD stages 3–5 patients (61 [53–67] years; 65% men). Left ventricular mass (LVM) was assessed by echocardiography (ECHO). ECG was performed to assess Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon voltage and their products (Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon product, respectively).

Results

The prevalence of LVH ranged from 72 to 89% depending on ECHO criteria used. Cornell product showed the best correlation with ECHO-estimated LVM (ρ = 0.41; P < 0.001). Across sex-specific tertiles of ECHO-LVM, ECG criteria increased and patients were more often hypertensive, obese, fluid overloaded, inflamed, and with higher albuminuria. Cornell product showed the strongest association with ECHO-LVM in crude and adjusted regression models, and the higher predictive performance for all the ECHO-based LVH definitions. However, when applying literature-based ECG cut-offs for LVH diagnosis, Sokolow-Lyon product showed a higher specificity. The agreement between ECG criteria cut-offs and ECHO-based definitions of LVH was in general poor, and the number of patients reclassified correctly by ECHO ranged from 77 to 94%.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that ECG alone is a weak indicator of LVH, and do not support its routine use as a unique tool in the screening of LVH in CKD patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to try establishing adequate cut-offs for LVH diagnosis in this population.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^1148oUDB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

After completing ergometric test, coronary heart disease was excluded from this study. Patients included in the study showed no difference in stress level or double product. The authors of numerous studies showed that low achieved heart rate, exercise capacity and Duke Treadmill score were dominant predictors of worst prognosis. 26, 27

Even though there were no differences between the tested groups in terms of basic features, medical treatment, blood pressure level, echocardiography, and ergometric parameters, the study showed difference in distribution of electrocardiographic markers of left ventricular hypertrophy. Having in mind the sensitivity of specific criteria and small number of cardiovascular events, which was a limitation of this study, not all known criteria of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy could undergo a valid statistical analysis. The study of Estes et al. 10 showed that complicated Romhilt‐Estes criterion for left ventricular hypertrophy was a good prognostic marker during 21.7‐year follow‐up of general population. The score of ≥ 5 was registered in only 1.4% of patients. Even though the patients included in this study had electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, it was present with very low percentage in both groups, that is, group without adverse events and group with adverse events (5.9% vs. 12.5%). Complexity and low presence in the first hypertrophy made it unfit for routine application. By using nuclear magnetic resonance as gold standard, Courand et al. 28 concluded that the voltage of R wave in aVL lead between 0.5 and 1 mV was a strong indicator of left ventricular hypertrophy. Similarly, Rodrigues et al. 29 recognized that the voltage of R wave in aVL lead ≥ 0.55 mV had good sensitivity (87%) for detecting LVH with preserved specificity (75%). This study showed no positive results of LVH based on R wave voltage (> 1.1 mV) in aVL lead at patients without adverse events, while it was present in 12.5% patients with composite events. However, the study highlighted four electrocardiographic criteria (Lewis voltage, Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage, and Cornell product) which were present in a group of patients with new composite events and thus were statistically significant. In the study of Levy et al. 30 Lyon‐Sokolow score and Cornell voltage QRS duration product were independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular events. The study of Tan et al. 31 concluded that the Cornell product was easily applicable ECG marker of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and predicted poor outcome by emphasizing the severity of diastolic dysfunction and LV hypertrophy. In the study of O'Neal et al. 32 the authors concluded that electrocardiographic and echocardiographic LVH could be used interchangeably in stroke risk scores (Harrell's concordance index). The study of Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS) found that ECG LVH was strongly related to cardiovascular events in elderly hypertensive patients. 33 The study showed that hazard ratio for cardiovascular events was 2.17 (95% CI: 1.54‐3.05, P < 0.0001) and 2.83 (95% CI: 1.91‐4.19, P < 0.0001) when SV 1 + RV 5 was classified into two groups at threshold values of 35 and 40 mm, respectively. In terms of analyzing Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, odds ratio in this study was 3.630 (1.331‐9.896; P < 0.05) for composite cardiovascular events. Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) Study proved that the reduction of electrocardiogram hypertension resulted in the reduction of cardiovascular risk, regardless of the changes in blood pressure. 34

### The clinical value of apex beat and electrocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy from the standpoint of the distance factors from the heart to the chest wall: a multislice CT study [^113fScTo]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Simple ECG criteria based on voltage had low sensitivity for the detection of anatomical LVH and previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the diagnostic value of these criteria. The variations may be attributed to the differences in the definition of anatomical LVH used in these studies or the effect of clinical characteristics such as sex, smoking and body size. Moreover, some studies reported that the measurements by MSCT overestimated LV volume, mass and left atrial volume compared with echocardiography or MRI. In this study, it is possible that those subjects diagnosed as anatomical LVH may represent lesser degrees of LV mass, which may lead to a skew in the results. Nevertheless, the overall superiority of Cornell voltage over Sokolow–Lyon voltage found in this study is in agreement with the results of previous studies. Horton et al. reported that the distance from the heart to the chest surface influences the amplitude of the recorded precordial voltage. They calculated the distance from the chest surface to mid-LV by using echocardiography. However, they did not consider the distance from the heart to the inner chest wall. Sokolow–Lyon voltage is the sum of two precordial voltages, both dependent on the distance between the heart and the electrode (chest surface). In this study, the Sokolow–Lyon voltage showed a stronger association with the distance to the chest surface, which was correlated with body size measurements, such as BMI, than with the distance to the inner chest wall. Therefore, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of Sokolow–Lyon voltage in obese patients were lower than those in the non-obese ones. In contrast, the specificity and positive predictive value of Sokolow–Lyon voltage in obese patients were higher than those in the non-obese ones. Because Cornell voltage is the sum of the precordial voltage and a limb voltage, which is less dependent on chest wall thickness, it is not surprising that the overall superiority of Cornell voltage was found in the previousand our studies.

### Gender differences in regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive therapy [^114kVXp9]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Although men and women differ in the magnitude of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy, whether gender differences exist in the degree of regression of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive therapy is unclear. ECG left ventricular hypertrophy defined using gender-adjusted Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria was assessed serially in 9193 hypertensive patients treated with losartan- or atenolol-based regimens. Changes in ECG left ventricular hypertrophy were measured from baseline to last in-study visit, and above-average regression of hypertrophy was identified by a ≥ 236-mm. ms reduction in Cornell product or ≥ 3.5-mm reduction in Sokolow-Lyon voltage. During mean follow-up of 4.8 ± 0.9 years, women had less reduction in Cornell product (-149 ± 823 versus -251 ± 890 mm. ms) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (-3.0 ± 6.8 versus -4.8 ± 7.7 mm) than men (both P < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline ECG left ventricular hypertrophy levels, baseline and change in systolic and diastolic pressures, treatment group, age, and other baseline gender differences, women had significantly less reduction in both Cornell product (adjusted means: -137 versus -276 mm. ms; P < 0.001) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (-3.6 versus -4.1 mm; P = 0.005) than men and were 32% less likely to have had greater than the median level of regression of Cornell product left ventricular hypertrophy (95% CI: 24% to 39%; P < 0.001) and 15% less likely to have had regression of left ventricular hypertrophy by Sokolow-Lyon criteria (95% CI: 5% to 23%; P = 0.003). Thus, women have less regression of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy than men in response to antihypertensive therapy, independent of baseline gender differences in the severity of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy and after taking into account treatment effects and blood pressure changes.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^113sz4Qy]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used tool to screen for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and yet current diagnostic criteria are insensitive in modern increasingly overweight society. We propose a simple adjustment to improve diagnostic accuracy in different body weights and improve the sensitivity of this universally available technique.

Methods

Overall, 1295 participants were included — 821 with a wide range of body mass index (BMI 17.1–53.3 kg/m²) initially underwent cardiac magnetic resonance evaluation of anatomical left ventricular (LV) axis, LV mass and 12-lead surface ECG in order to generate an adjustment factor applied to the Sokolow–Lyon criteria. This factor was then validated in a second cohort (n = 520, BMI 15.9–63.2 kg/m²).

Results

When matched for LV mass, the combination of leftward anatomical axis deviation and increased BMI resulted in a reduction of the Sokolow–Lyon index, by 4 mm in overweight and 8 mm in obesity. After adjusting for this in the initial cohort, the sensitivity of the Sokolow–Lyon index increased (overweight: 12.8% to 30.8%, obese: 3.1% to 27.2%) approaching that seen in normal weight (37.8%). Similar results were achieved in the validation cohort (specificity increased in overweight: 8.3% to 39.1%, obese: 9.4% to 25.0%) again approaching normal weight (39.0%). Importantly, specificity remained excellent (> 93.1%).

Conclusions

Adjusting the Sokolow–Lyon index for BMI (overweight +4 mm, obesity +8 mm) improves the diagnostic accuracy for detecting LVH. As the ECG, worldwide, remains the most widely used screening tool for LVH, implementing these findings should translate into significant clinical benefit.

### Discrepancy between left ventricular hypertrophy by echocardiography and electrocardiographic hypertrophy: clinical characteristics and outcomes [^117C9fzU]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional analyses: Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon voltage as ECG criteria

When we used the Cornell voltage as the ECG criteria for LVH (online supplemental table 3), the Kaplan-Meier curves were mostly consistent with the main analysis (online supplemental figure 2A). After adjusting for confounders, the risk of those with both ECG-based and echo-based LVH and only echo-based LVH remained significant for the primary outcome measure (online supplemental table 4). When we used the Sokolow-Lyon voltage as the ECG criteria for LVH (online supplemental table 5), the Kaplan-Meier curves were mostly consistent with the main analysis (online supplemental figure 2B). After adjusting for confounders, the risk of those with both ECG-based and Echo-based LVH and only Echo-based LVH remained significant for the primary outcome measure (online supplemental table 6).

### Electrocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy [^116f9WK1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have low sensitivity.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to test a new method to improve the diagnostic performance of the electrocardiogram.

Methods

The study was divided into 2 groups, a test and a validation cohort. In the test cohort, 94 patients were analyzed, including 47 with the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 47 with normal blood pressure at admission. Echocardiography was used to estimate the left ventricular mass index. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used for comparison of single and combined leads. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement among the ECG criteria against the left ventricular mass index. The proposed ECG criteria involved measuring the amplitude of the deepest S wave (S D) in any single lead and adding it to the S wave amplitude of lead V 4 (SV 4). Currently accepted LVH ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon were used for comparison. The validation cohort consisted of 122 consecutive patients referred for an echocardiogram regardless of the admitting diagnosis.

Results

The S D was the most accurate single lead measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; p < 0.001). When both cohorts were analyzed, the S D + SV 4 criteria outperformed Cornell voltage with a significantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]). The specificities of all the criteria were ≥ 90%, with no significant difference among them.

Conclusions

The proposed criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LVH improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test.

### Optimized electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity patients [^115KrdNe]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the current study, we demonstrated that in obesity patients, established ECG criteria for the detection of LVH lack sufficient sensitivity for application in daily clinical practice. We propose new criteria, (RaVL + SV3)×BMI ≥ 700 mm·kg/m² for males and (SV1 + RV5/RV6)×BMI ≥ 885 mm·kg/m² for females, for the detection of LVH in obesity patients with improved sensitivity, without losing specificity.

The explanation of the poor sensitivity of the established ECG criteria for detection of LVH (3%‐9% in females and 0%‐16% in males) may be that obesity patients commonly have reduced voltages in the precordial ECG leads, probably because the ECG voltages at the skin level are attenuated by the subcutaneous adipose tissue. 14 The sensitivity of these criteria may be improved by adjustment of the cut‐off values and correction for BMI. Applying this, the Cornell voltage*BMI for males and Sokolow‐Lyon index*BMI for females, showed an important improvement of the sensitivity of an ECG for the detection of LVH in obesity patients to 47% and 26%, respectively, using the optimal cut‐off values (both identified in analysis using a fixed specificity of 95%).

Because in obesity patients with cardiac disease there may often already be a clinical indication for an echocardiogram, an ECG as a screening tool for detection of LVH may have the most value in obesity patients without known cardiac disease. In the current study for the first time, adjusted ECG criteria for the detection of LVH were tested in such a relatively low‐risk obese population. Even in these subjects, the proposed new criteria performed fairly very well (sensitivity of 40% for the Cornell voltage*BMI in males and 23% for the Sokolow‐Lyon index*BMI in females, using the optimal cut‐off values). Although these sensitivity values appear to be rather poor, also in lean subjects the sensitivity of ECG criteria for LVH is known to be limited. A review of multiple studies in different healthcare settings found that the sensitivity of the Cornell voltage and Sokolow‐Lyon index ranged from 2% to 52% with a specificity ranging from 71% to 100%. 24 Therefore, in our study, it was shown that the sensitivity of an ECG to detect LVH in obesity patients without known cardiac disease may be comparable to known sensitivity in lean subjects when using the proposed new criteria.

### Do we need new electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy? The case of the peguero-Lo presti criterion. A narrative review [^111CDDqh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of 14 comparative studies targeting the value of Peguero–Lo Presti (PLP) criterion vs. established diagnostic electrocardiographic criteria (SL, Sokolow–Lyon voltage; CV, Cornell voltage) in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) having echocardiography as reference

As reported in Table 2, the prevalence of ECHO LVH varied markedly between studies (i.e. 11.6%–58.0%), although it should be emphasized that most of them included samples with a high prevalence of this adverse cardiac phenotype (over 40% in 7 of the 13 studies providing provided this information). The diagnostic sensitivity of the PLP criterion compared with SL and/or CV criteria was greater in 11 out of the 13 studies. A gender-based analysis performed by 2 studies suggested greater PLP sensitivity in both sexes. On the contrary, the diagnostic specificity of the PLP criterion was lower than the traditional ones in almost all the studies considered. Table 3 summarizes the overall diagnostic performance of the 3 ECG criteria assessed by receiver-operating characteristic curves and expressed as area under the curve (AUC). All but one of the 10 studies providing this metric reported that the AUC associated with the PLP was lower than with the CV criterion. This was not the case for the SL criterion whose AUC was lower than that of PLP in the majority of studies.

### The determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy defined by sokolow-Lyon criteria in untreated hypertensive patients [^115XpWya]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) measured by electrocardiography (ECG LVH) in hypertensive patients has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae. Analysis of the determinants predisposing to ECG LVH may be helpful in the prevention of LVH. The Department of Health and Social Security Hypertension Care Computer Project studied 2994 hypertensive patients in whom an electrocardiogram was recorded while not on treatment. LVH was determined as the voltage sum SV1+RV5 or RV6 ≥ 35 mm using Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria. The relations were determined between the presence of LVH or voltage sum and different variables. Untreated systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and pulse pressure were positively related to the increasing ECG voltage, while body mass index (BMI) and serum cholesterol were inversely related. Blood glucose and age did not correlate significantly. Patients with the presence of ECG LVH were more often men, black people, smokers and users of alcohol. In multiple logistic regression analyses, SBP, DBP, male gender and black race were positively, whereas BMI was negatively related to the presence of LVH. The positive relation of smoking and negative relation of serum cholesterol concentration to the presence of ECG LVH were apparent in men but not in women. This study confirms the adverse association between ECG LVH and SBP and DBP, male gender, black race and decreased BMI. It also addresses the less well-known associations of blood glucose, cholesterol, smoking and alcohol consumption.

### Regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertension [^112zqdf7]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events, particularly stroke, making prevention of new-onset AF a clinical priority. Although the presence and severity of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) appear to predict development of AF, whether regression of electrocardiographic LVH is associated with a decreased incidence of AF is unclear.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that in-treatment regression or continued absence of electrocardiographic LVH during antihypertensive therapy is associated with a decreased incidence of AF, independent of blood pressure and treatment modality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in 1995–2001 among 8831 men and women with hypertension, aged 55–80 years (median, 67 years), with electrocardiographic LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product or Sokolow-Lyon voltage, with no history of AF, without AF on the baseline electrocardiogram, and enrolled in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study.

Interventions

Losartan- or atenolol-based treatment regimens, with follow-up assessments at 6 months and then yearly until death or study end.

Main Outcome Measure

New-onset AF in relation to electrocardiographic LVH determined at baseline and subsequently. Electrocardiographic LVH was measured using sex-adjusted Cornell product criteria ({R(aVL) + S(V3) [+ 6 mm in women]} x QRS duration).

Results

After a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.7 (1.1) years, new-onset AF occurred in 290 patients with in-treatment regression or continued absence of Cornell product LVH for a rate of 14.9 per 1000 patient-years and in 411 patients with in-treatment persistence or development of LVH by Cornell product criteria for a rate of 19.0 per 1000 patient-years. In time-dependent Cox analyses adjusted for treatment effects, baseline differences in risk factors for AF, baseline and in-treatment blood pressure, and baseline severity of electrocardiographic LVH, lower in-treatment Cornell product LVH treated as a time-varying covariate was associated with a 12.4% lower rate of new-onset AF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.97; p = 0.007) for every 1050 mm x msec (per 1-SD) lower Cornell product, with persistence of the benefit of losartan vs atenolol therapy on developing AF (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.97; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Lower Cornell product electrocardiographic LVH during antihypertensive therapy is associated with a lower likelihood of new-onset AF, independent of blood pressure lowering and treatment modality in essential hypertension. These findings suggest that antihypertensive therapy targeted at regression or prevention of electrocardiographic LVH may reduce the incidence of new-onset AF.

### Additional impact of electrocardiographic over echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy for predicting the risk of ischemic stroke [^111jmaLf]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Although echocardiography is commonly used for the diagnosis of LVH, there is little information about the potential role of electrocardiography in providing additional prognostic information. The purpose of this study is to determine if electrocardiographically derived criteria for LVH provide additional prognostic value over echocardiography for predicting ischemic stroke in a multiethnic population.

Methods

A population-based, case-control study was conducted in 177 patients who had had a first ischemic stroke and in 246 control patients matched for age, gender, and race or ethnicity. Left ventricular mass was measured by using 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of stroke associated with the presence of LVH diagnosed by electrocardiography (defined by 4 established criteria) after adjustment for the presence of other stroke risk factors and for echocardiographically determined LVH.

Results

After adjustment for the presence of other established stroke risk factors, ECG-LVH was associated with ischemic stroke, using Sokolow-Lyon (odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% CI 1.05–4.30), Cornell voltage (OR 2.06, 95% CI, 1.26–3.35), and Cornell product criteria (OR 2.12, 95% CI, 1.13–3.97). Cornell voltage criterion (men, > 2.8 mV; women, > 2.0 mV) was associated with ischemic stroke even after adjustment for echocardiographically determined LVH (OR 1.73, 95% CI, 1.04–2.88). The combination of echo-LVH and a positive Cornell voltage criterion was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in stroke risk.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that the presence of ECG-LVH is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for other stroke risk factors. For Cornell voltage criteria, this relationship persisted even after adjustment for echocardiographic LVH. Electrocardiographic results can provide independent information for left ventricular myocardial changes and should be considered together with echocardiographic results to fully assess the risk of ischemic stroke.

### Soluble ST2 is a biomarker associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and concentric hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension [^114JdftA]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The LV is a key point for the end-organ damage induced by hypertension. LVH manifests as a complex series of myocardial adaptations. The development of LVH involves multiple biological mechanisms, including the hypertrophy and fibrosis processes of cardiac muscle cells. In clinical practice, electrocardiography serves as a prevalent screening method for LVH owing to its widespread availability and cost-effectiveness, as proposed in the Chinese hypertension guidelines. Various electrocardiographic criteria, such as the Sokolow–Lyon and Cornell criteria, have been used for LVH assessment. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of electrocardiography in detecting LVH is considered relatively low, especially among the Chinese and other East Asian populations. Echocardiography has shown superior sensitivity for LVH detection. However, this approach requires considerable professional knowledge and has low accessibility. According to the 2023 ESC/ESH guidelines, echocardiography is a secondary diagnostic tool for LVH. It is recommended, only if specific cardiac structures and functions affect treatment decisions. Therefore, biomarkers associated with LVH and CH are clinically important for risk stratification and prognosis in hypertension patients.

### The prognostic value of the ECG in hypertension: where are we now? [^113sBA6R]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

In hypertension, the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with increased risk of both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To date, the electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the cornerstone of LVH diagnosis in clinical practice because it is universally available, technically easy to perform and highly specific. In the most recent European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the treatment of arterial hypertension, the Sokolow-Lyon voltage criterion was recommended as part of all routine assessment of subjects with hypertension. However, the use of the ECG in the diagnosis of LVH is somewhat limited by its poor sensitivity. In this review article, we discuss the individual strength and weaknesses of the commonly used ECG criteria in diagnosing LVH. In addition, we present the latest data on the prognostic significance of ECG LVH and the survival differences conferred in different genders. In view of the recent Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension trial, the prognostic benefit of LVH regression will also be addressed. Finally, with the wider availability of echocardiography, the role of combining both modalities to improve risk stratification in hypertension is reviewed.

### Determinants and prognostic significance of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy criteria in chronic kidney disease [^114zwkP2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has prognostic value in the general population. However, among those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the determinants of electrocardiographic (EKG) LVH and its prognostic value are not clear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A cross-sectional study was performed among 387 consenting consecutive patients from a veterans hospital with a longitudinal follow-up.

Results

The overall prevalence of EKG-LVH by the Sokolow-Lyon criteria was 8% and by the Cornell voltage-duration product was 11%. Compared with non-CKD controls, CKD patients had unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for LVH by Cornell criteria of 2.52 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.42). Significance was lost after adjustment. The unadjusted OR for LVH by Sokolow-Lyon criteria was 2.24 (95% CI 0.95 to 5.33). This OR remained statistically insignificant after multivariate adjustment. Anemia, proteinuria, and 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP were associated with EKG-LVH regardless of diagnostic criteria. After a 7.5-year median follow-up, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was not associated with EKG-LVH diagnosed by the Sokolow-Lyon criteria; however, multivariable adjustments made EKG-LVH significant. A statistically significant relationship was seen between mortality and Cornell criteria; however, multivariable adjustments made EKG-LVH nonsignificant.

Conclusions

The Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell EKG-LVH criteria cannot be used interchangeably to diagnose LVH or determine prognosis. Among those with CKD, ambulatory systolic BP predicts all-cause mortality. Moreover, the duration and severity of BP elevation presumably reflected in EKG-LVH diagnosed by Sokolow-Lyon criteria is also of prognostic significance; the Cornell criteria do not carry independent prognostic information.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^116W8EEY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our key finding was that the ECG criteria had low sensitivity and high specificity in the diagnosis of the echocardiographic LVH, especially the eccentric pattern. Nonetheless, the use of any of the 4 ECG criteria including Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage or any of the 7 ECG criteria may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for LVH in Chinese hypertensive patients.

Although it is known that the ECG LVH criteria might be ethnic dependent, few studies explored this important issue, and no study has yet evaluated the performance of ECG criteria for the new echocardiographic LVH criteria in Asians. With the old echocardiographic LVH criteria for the diagnosis of LVH, several previous studies investigated the accuracy of ECG criteria in the detection of LVH in Asians. In 546 Chinese patients with hypertension, Xie et al. found that the Cornell voltage and product criteria had a higher sensitivity to detect echocardiographic LVH (28% and 36.6%, respectively). In 539 young army men in Taiwan, Su et al. found that the Cornell voltage and product criteria had better performance for the echocardiographic LVH than the Sokolow–Lyon criteria, with a sensitivity of 22.2%, 27.8%, and 8.3%, respectively. However, in 332 Korean patients seen in a cardiology department, Park et al. demonstrated that the Cornell product criterion was superior to the Sokolow–Lyon voltage criterion in women, but the opposite was true in men.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy as compared with cardiac computed tomography: from the rule out myocardial infarction using computer assisted tomography trial [^111fbs8T]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is a state-of-the-art technology that provides an accurate noninvasive method to quantify left ventricular mass for analysis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We aimed to examine seven ECG-based LVH criteria against two CT indexation criteria for LVH: a CT-specific body surface area cutoff and the obesity-independent height criteria.

Methods

In 333 patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years, 61% men), 64-slice contrast-enhanced CT was performed and 12-lead surface ECG within 24 h. Left ventricular mass was measured at end-diastole. Using both CT indexation criteria, the cohort was subdivided into patients with LVH and without LVH. The seven ECG criteria for LVH were the Cornell voltage index, Cornell voltage duration product, Cornell/strain index, Sokolow-Lyon index, Romhilt-Estes scores at least 4 and at least 5, and Gubner-Ungerleider.

Results

The ECG parameters had high specificities (85–97%) and variable low sensitivities (4–43%) when compared to either CT criteria of LVH. The three Cornell-based methods performed the best (test-positive likelihood ratio: 4.5–6.7), followed by the Sokolow-Lyon and Romhilt-Estes scores (test-positive likelihood ratio: 2.3–4.0). With the exception of the Gubner-Ungerleider criterion, the other six ECG criteria were associated with at least one of the CT-based LVH (adjusted odds ratio 2.4–9.5) and had incremental predictive value beyond that of hypertension history.

Conclusion

Using cardiac CT as a gold standard for LVH assessment, ECG criteria for LVH have high specificities with the three Cornell-based criteria providing the best test performance for identifying patients with LVH.

### The clinical value of apex beat and electrocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy from the standpoint of the distance factors from the heart to the chest wall: a multislice CT study [^114Qd1Zy]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of the apex beat and two ECG voltage criteria in the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) while considering two distances, from the heart to the inner chest wall and to the chest surface, measured by using multislice CT (MSCT). The study population consisted of 151 patients clinically judged as requiring MSCT angiography. The apex beat was palpated with patients in the supine. Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell voltage to detect LVH were determined. The pattern of sustained or double apical impulse and Cornell voltage had higher specificity as an indicator of LVH than Sokolow-Lyon voltage. Furthermore, the distance to the inner chest wall was negatively correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic volume and mass. Contrarily, the distance to the chest surface was correlated with the body mass index. Multivariate analyses revealed that the pattern of sustained or double apical impulse showed a stronger association with the distance to the inner chest wall than to the chest surface, but Sokolow-Lyon voltage was associated with the distance to the chest surface. Among the screening tests for excluding patients with LVH, Cornell voltage or the apex beat would be better than Sokolow-Lyon voltage because these are less dependent on body size and have higher specificity.

### Prognostic impact of baseline and serial changes in electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in resistant hypertension [^114cJVY4]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) in resistant hypertension (RH) is unknown. The aim was to evaluate the importance of baseline and serial changes in ECG-LVH as predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with RH.

Methods

At baseline and during follow-up, 552 resistant hypertensive patients had 3 ECG-LVH criteria obtained: Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell voltage, and Cornell voltage-duration product. Primary end points were a composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Total strokes and coronary heart disease (CHD) events were secondary end points. Multiple Cox regression assessed the associations between time-varying ECG-LVH and subsequent end points.

Results

After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 70 patients died, 46 from cardiovascular causes; and 109 total cardiovascular events occurred, 46 strokes, and 44 CHD events. After adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, baseline Cornell voltage and product, but not Sokolow-Lyon voltage, were independent predictors of the composite end point and of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Reductions of all ECG-LVH criteria were protective factors for the composite end point: a 1-SD (1.1 mV) reduction in Sokolow-Lyon voltage was associated with a 35% lower risk (95% CI 10%-53%) of cardiovascular events, whereas prevention or regression of Cornell product LVH criterion implied a 40% lower risk (95% CI 11%-60%). Baseline and serial changes in Sokolow-Lyon voltage were independent predictors of strokes, whereas Cornell voltage was predictive of CHD events.

Conclusions

Baseline and serial changes in ECG-LVH predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in RH patients. Antihypertensive treatment targeted at regression or prevention of ECG-LVH may improve prognosis.

### Differences in diagnostic value of four electrocardiographic voltage criteria for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a genotyped population [^1159dQmh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of various classic electrocardiographic (ECG) voltage criteria for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) has not been established in a genotyped population. This study aimed to determine the most accurate diagnostic definition of classic ECG voltage criteria for detecting carriers of HC. ECG and echocardiographic findings were analyzed in 161 genotyped subjects (97 genetically affected, 64 unaffected) from 20 families with disease-causing mutations in 4 genes. The diagnostic value of 4 voltage criteria (Cornell, Sokolow-Lyon, Romhilt-Estes, and 12-lead QRS voltage) for detecting carriers of HC was investigated. In all subjects, the Romhilt-Estes (point score ≥ 4) criterion and 12-lead QRS voltage (≥ 240 mm) were most sensitive (37% and 36%, respectively), with high specificity (95% each), resulting in the greatest accuracy (60% and 59%, respectively). Using these criteria, in subjects without echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, voltage abnormalities were found in 22.6% of carriers and 4.7% of noncarriers (p < 0.01). In conclusion, these findings suggest that the Romhilt-Estes and the 12-lead QRS voltage criteria may be the most accurate diagnostic definitions for HC on the basis of molecular genetic diagnoses. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that voltage abnormalities may be found in prehypertrophic carriers. Even when genetic testing becomes widely available, it will be difficult to make genetic diagnoses in all patients with HC because of its genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, understanding the diagnostic value of classic ECG voltage criteria may be important in detecting carriers, including those without left ventricular hypertrophy.

Validating the proposed adjustment

In order to validate the proposed ECG adjustment, this was repeated in an independent cohort of 520 participants. Of these, 48 had CMR-defined LVH (9.3%). As with the initial cohort, despite an increase in LV mass accompanying obesity (21 g, p < 0.001), ECG voltage criteria decreased by 4 mm (p < 0.001, table 1).

When adjusting the Sokolow–Lyon index (overweight+4 mm, obesity+8 mm) for the entire validation cohort, sensitivity increased significantly from 17.9 (8.9–28.7) to 28.1 (17.6–40.8), p < 0.001, table 2. As with the initial cohort, large gains in sensitivity were observed in the obesity group, from 9.4 (1.1–28.0) to 25.0 (11.5–43.4), and also observed in the overweight group, from 8.3 (1.1–28.0) to 39.1 (19.7–61.5), table 2, all p < 0.001. Again, specificity remained high even after adjustment (> 93.1%). This confirms, in a validation cohort, that this simple adjustment can substantially improve the diagnostic accuracy of the Sokolow–Lyon criteria in detecting LVH (Youden index increases from 0.12 (CI 0.02 to 0.23) to 0.30 (CI 0.17 to 0.42), ROC AUC increases from 0.60 to 0.70). However, due to the small sample size of non-Europeans in this study, this adjustment has not been sufficiently validated in the non-Caucasian population.

### Screening for left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the community [^1142XNMj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

ECG

The 12-lead ECG, the most commonly used tool for diagnosis of LVH in the community, performed poorly in detecting LVH compared to echocardiography. The most widely used ECG criteria are the Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria. Using these criteria, the prevalence of LVH in this cohort would only be 1%. The combination of both the Sokolow-Lyon and the Cornell voltage criteria only raised the prevalence to 1.7%. Similarly in the Scottish study of diabetes clinic patients, in whom the prevalence of echocardiographic LVH was 71%, the prevalence of ECG LVH using the LIFE criteria was only 9.2%. The poor performance of ECG in detecting LVH, using voltage-based criteria, may result from the attenuation of electrocardiographic voltages at the skin surface by increased fat mass in obese individuals. In our study participants with a higher BMI were found to have a higher prevalence of echocardiographic LVH (73% vs. 39%), yet lower mean Sokolow-Lyon voltages (1.7 mV vs. 1.9 mV) and the same mean Cornell voltages (1.2 mV).

### Implication of different ECG left ventricular hypertrophy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112tdpb2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior studies showed that the absence ECG LVH by Cornell and Sokolow‐Lyon criteria was associated with poorer outcomes and increased mortality. In our study, only the Cornell criteria showed a significant association with all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. Although an exact physiological explanation for such discrepancy should be further elucidated, the clinical ECG LVH indices, Cornell criteria and Sokolow‐Lyon index, were affected differently by LV mass and by anatomic changes and/ or conduction velocity slowing (Cornell voltage was more affected by conduction velocity than Sokolow‐Lyon criteria). Also, among 3 ECG LVH criteria, Cornell index is the only negative predictor for myocardium fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Considering these characteristics of Cornell criteria, the absence of ECG LVH by Cornell criteria in patients with severe AS may have advanced myocardium fibrosis and altered conduction, which resulted in poor prognosis after TAVR.

Our study has several limitations. First, as our study is an analysis of nonrandomized, observational data, unaccounted confounding variables may have influenced the observed findings. Therefore, our findings should be considered hypothesis generating only. Second, although ECG measurements were performed by 2 experienced cardiologists, the ECG data were not adjudicated by an independent core laboratory. However, our results showed consistency in that the patients determined to have ECG LVH had severe AS hemodynamics and higher LV mass index regardless of the criteria used. Third, ECG LVH was categorized simply as present or absent according to a cutoff value of the criteria score. Also, ECG measurements provide a less accurate assessment of LVH than echocardiographic or other imaging measurements. Nevertheless, ECG measurements are the most simplistic and easily used diagnostic approach for characterizing LVH and also provide another electrical abnormality. Fourth, we did not directly assess cardiac amyloidosis or the extent of myocardial fibrosis, which are some of the main pathologic findings in patients with AS without ECG LVH. Further studies investigating the association between ECG LVH and pathologic findings in patients with AS are needed. Fifth, considering the relatively small sample size of patients and clinical events, our study might have been underpowered to detect hard clinical end points according to different ECG LVH criteria. Sixth, we used linear cube formula for calculating LV mass index. Although the linear method is widely used, this method may not reflect well with actual LV mass in severe AS owing to a change of LV geometry. Last, the direct applicability of our study findings to other populations of different racial or ethnic groups might be questionable.

3.3 Accuracy of adjusted criteria for detection of LVH in obesity patients (test cohort)

New cut‐off values for both males and females were defined for all criteria, with a fixed 95% specificity. The new cut‐off values for the Cornell voltage, Sokolow‐Lyon index, and Peguero‐Lo Presti criteria were, respectively, ≥ 20, 24, and 19 mm for females and ≥ 27, 27, and 23 mm for males. All criteria were multiplied by BMI. The optimal cut‐off values for the Cornell voltage*BMI, Sokolow‐Lyon index*BMI, and Peguero‐Lo Presti criteria*BMI were, respectively, ≥ 795, 885, and 780 mm*kg/m 2 for females and ≥ 700, 984, and 900 mm*kg/m 2 for males. Using these adjusted cut‐off values, the Cornell voltage*BMI, (RaVL + SV3)×BMI ≥ 700 mm·kg/m², had the best sensitivity for males (47%, CI: 25%‐70%), specificity 96% (CI: 78%‐100%), ROC AUC 0.65, PPV 90% (CI: 54%‐99%), and NPV 71% (CI: 52%‐84%). The Sokolow‐Lyon index*BMI, (SV1 + RV5/RV6)×BMI ≥ 885 mm·kg/m², had the best sensitivity for females (26%, CI: 14%‐45%), specificity 93% (CI: 85%‐97%), ROC AUC 0.69, PPV 60% (CI: 33%‐83%), and NPV 77% (CI: 68%‐84%).

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^1142hyEr]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Performance of electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in Chinese hypertensive patients is not well known. We investigated the accuracy of various ECG criteria for the diagnosis of the echocardiographic LVH according to the new cutoff values of left ventricular mass (LVM) index (> 115 g/m² for men and > 95 g/m² for women) in Chinese hypertensive patients.

Methods

Our study included 702 consecutive hypertensive inpatients including 92 (13.1%) concentric and 121 (17.2%) eccentric LVH on standard echocardiography. Diagnostic accuracy of 7 ECG criteria was evaluated by calculating sensitivity and specificity and by using the receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

The ECG criteria for the detection of the echocardiographically defined LVH had a sensitivity of 15%-31.9% and specificity of 91.6%-99.2% overall, 20.7%-43.5% and 91.6%-99.2% concentric, and 7.4%-23.1% and 91.6%-99.2% eccentric. ECG diagnosis of LVH defined as the positive diagnosis of any of 4 ECG criteria including Sokolow-Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 86.3% overall, 71.7% and 86.3% concentric, and 40.5% and 86.3% eccentric. After adjustment for confounding factors, various ECG criteria were significantly correlated with LVM, with standardized β coefficients from 0.20 to 0.39 (P < 0.001) and the highest coefficient for the Cornell product criterion.

Conclusions

All ECG LVH indexes had low sensitivity and high specificity in Chinese hypertensive patients. Combination of 4 or all ECG criteria might improve sensitivity without any loss of specificity.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy: an ECG-based study of prevalence and risk factors in a multiethnic population [^114mNFuD]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Population characteristics

The prevalence of LVH decreased with higher level of educational attainment. The prevalence of LVH in those with 6 or fewer years of education was 11.1% (95% CI 10.2% to 12.0%)) compared with individuals with 7–12 years of education (7.2% (95% CI 6.4% to 8.1%)) or a tertiary level of education (5.1% (95% CI 3.2% to 7.1%)) (see also table 1).

Among the 875 individuals with LVH, a total of 419 (48%) fulfilled the Sokolow-Lyon criteria, 269 (31%) individuals fulfilled the Cornell voltage, and 506 (58%) fulfilled the Cornell product. The criteria overlapped, and 18% of those detected by Sokolow-Lyon were also detected by Cornell voltage and or Cornell product, 91% of those detected by Cornell voltage were also detected by Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell product, and 52% of those detected by Cornell product were also detected by Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell voltage (figure 2).

### Ethnic differences in electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. losartan intervention for endpoint [^111wNxzG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

African Americans have greater precordial QRS voltages than whites, with concomitant higher prevalences of electrocardiographic (ECG) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and lower specificity of ECG LVH criteria for the identification of anatomic hypertrophy. However, the high mortality associated with LVH in African American patients makes more accurate ECG detection of LVH in these patients a clinical priority.

Methods

Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were obtained at study baseline in 120 African American and 751 white hypertensive patients enrolled in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) echocardiographic substudy. The ECG LVH was determined using Sokolow-Lyon, 12-lead sum, and Cornell voltage criteria. Echocardiographic LVH was defined by LV mass indexed to height(2.7) > 46.7 g/m(2.7) in women and > 49.1 g/m(2.7) in men.

Results

After adjusting for ethnic differences in LV mass, body mass index, sex, and prevalence of diabetes, mean Sokolow-Lyon and 12-lead sum of voltage were significantly higher, but Cornell voltage was lower, in African Americans than in whites. As a consequence of these differences, when identical partition values were used in both ethnic groups, Sokolow-Lyon and 12-lead voltage criteria had lower specificity in African Americans than whites (44% v 69%, P = 0.007 and 44% v 59%, P = 0.10) but had greater sensitivity in African Americans (51% v 27%, P < .001 and 62% v 45%, P = 0.003). In contrast, Cornell voltage specificity was higher (78% v 62%, P = 0.09) but sensitivity was slightly lower (49% v 57%, P = 0.16) in African Americans. However, when overall test performance was compared using receiver operating curve analyses that were independent of partition value selection, ethnic differences in test performance disappeared, with no differences in accuracy of any of the ECG voltage criteria for the identification of LVH between African American and white hypertensive individuals.

Conclusions

When standard, non-ethnicity-specific thresholds for the identification of LVH are used, Sokolow-Lyon and 12-lead voltage overestimate and Cornell voltage underestimates the presence and severity of LVH in African American relative to white individuals. However, these apparent ethnic differences in test performance disappear when ethnic differences in the distribution of ECG LVH criteria are taken into account. These findings demonstrate that ethnicity-specific ECG criteria can equalize detection of anatomic LVH in African American and white patients.

### Regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy by losartan versus atenolol: the losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study [^1112QWDp]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and regression of ECG LVH may predict improved prognosis in hypertensive patients. However, uncertainty persists as to how best to regress ECG LVH.

Methods and Results

Regression of ECG LVH with losartan versus atenolol therapy was assessed in 9193 hypertensive patients with ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon voltage or Cornell voltage-duration product criteria enrolled in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) Study. Patients had ECGs at study baseline and after 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of blinded losartan-based or atenolol-based therapy. After 6 months' follow-up, adjusting for baseline ECG LVH levels, baseline and in-treatment systolic and diastolic pressures, and for diuretic therapy, losartan-based therapy was associated with greater regression of both Cornell product (adjusted means, -200 versus -69 mm. ms, P < 0.001) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (-2.5 versus -0.7 mm, P < 0.001) than was atenolol-based therapy. Greater regression of ECG LVH persisted at each subsequent annual evaluation in the losartan-treated group, with between 140 and 164 mm. ms greater mean reductions in Cornell product and from 1.7 to 2.2 mm greater mean reductions in Sokolow-Lyon voltage (all P < 0.001). The effect of losartan was consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, ethnicity, and diabetes.

Conclusions

After adjusting for baseline and in-treatment blood pressure and baseline severity of ECG LVH, losartan-based antihypertensive therapy resulted in greater regression of ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria than did atenolol-based therapy. These findings support the value of angiotensin receptor blockade with losartan for reversing ECG LVH.

### Sex-specific electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in young athletes [^1143iHSf]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common electrocardiographic (ECG) finding in athletes, but existing amplitude-based criteria often generate false positives.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to reevaluate ECG criteria for screening athletes for left ventricular hypertrophy by considering QRS amplitude measurements and demographic factors, using data from an extensive digital ECG database.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of digitized ECG records from 9254 young athletes aged 12–35 years underwent a preparticipation examination between 2010 and 2021. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed R- and S-wave amplitudes by applying the 99th percentile for R waves and the 1st percentile for S waves and examined the Sokolow-Lyon (SL) precordial lead score and the limb lead (LL) score, adjusting for sex, sport, age, class (athlete classification [college, grade school, high school, and professional]), body mass index, and heart rate.

Results

Our findings demonstrate significant sex differences in R- and S-wave voltages, with the highest R-wave voltages observed at the 99th percentile in lead V 4, V 5, or V 6 (4.4 mV for males and 3.3 mV for females). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that male athletes had significantly higher SL and LL scores than did females. While age, sport, ethnicity, and body mass index influenced SL and LL scores, their effect was much weaker than those of sex and impractical for general use.

Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate that the 99th percentile values for sex-specific QRS voltage criteria (SL score of > 6.8 mV for males and > 4.7 for females; LL score of > 2.3 mV for males and > 1.9 mV for females) can enhance ECG criteria in athletes by increasing sensitivity for pathological hypertrophy with modest decreases in specificity.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^111NyhjK]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of adjusting ECG criteria on diagnostic performance in the initial cohort

When adjusting the Sokolow–Lyon index (overweight+4 mm, obesity+8 mm) for the entire initial study group, the sensitivity increased from 14.7% (10.0% to 20.8%) to 31.4% (24.9% to 38.7%) (p < 0.001, table 2). The largest gain in sensitivity was observed in the obese group from 3.1.% (0.4% to 10.8%) to 27.2% (18.0% to 39.0%), with lower, but substantial gains observed in the overweight group from 12.8% to 30.8% (table 2 all p < 0.001). Notably, specificity remained high at > 96.9%, even after adjustment. This would suggest this simple adjustment improves the diagnostic accuracy of the Sokolow–Lyon criteria nearing that seen in normal weight subjects. In support of this, increases in Youden index (0.28 (CI 0.21 to 0.35)), positive predictive value (0.66 (CI 0.54 to 0.76)) and negative predictive value (0.84 (CI 0.81 to 0.86)) were seen (table 2).

### The effect of obesity on electrocardiographic detection of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy: recalibration against cardiac magnetic resonance [^111rXDu9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Electrocardiograph (ECG) criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are a widely used clinical tool. We recalibrated six ECG criteria for LVH against gold-standard cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and assessed the impact of obesity. One hundred and fifty consecutive tertiary hypertension clinic referrals for CMR (1.5 T) were reviewed. Patients with cardiac pathology potentially confounding hypertensive LVH were excluded (n = 22). The final sample size was 128 (age: 51.0 ± 15.2 years, 48% male). LVH was defined by CMR. From a 12-lead ECG, Sokolow–Lyon voltage and product, Cornell voltage and product, Gubner–Ungerleidger voltage and Romhilt–Estes score were evaluated, blinded to the CMR. ECG diagnostic performance was calculated. LVH by CMR was present in 37% and obesity in 51%. Obesity significantly reduced ECG sensitivity, because of significant attenuation in mean ECG values for Cornell voltage (22.2 ± 5.7 vs 26.4 ± 9.4 mm, P < 0.05), Cornell product (2540 ± 942 vs 3023 ± 1185 mm
- ms, P < 0.05) and for Gubner–Ungerleider voltage (18.2 ± 7.1 vs 23.3 ± 1.2 mm, P < 0.05). Obesity also significantly reduced ECG specificity, because of significantly higher prevalence of LV remodeling (no LVH but increased mass-to-volume ratio) in obese subjects without LVH (36% vs 16%, P < 0.05), which correlated with higher mean ECG LVH criteria values. Obesity-specific partition values were generated at fixed 95% specificity; Cornell voltage had highest sensitivity in non-obese (56%) and Sokolow–Lyon product in obese patients (24%). Obesity significantly lowers ECG sensitivity at detecting LVH, by attenuating ECG LVH values, and lowers ECG specificity through changes associated with LV remodeling. Our obesity-specific ECG partition values could improve the diagnostic performance in obese patients with hypertension.

RESULTS

Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients

The 702 study participants included 449 men (64%), and had a mean (± SD) age of 51.9 ± 15.2 years. The proportion of patients with echocardiographic LVH was 30.3% (n = 213), including 92 patients concentric and 121 patients eccentric. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of these patients with LVH and those with normal geometry (n = 489). The 3 groups significantly differed in most of the characteristics (P < 0.05), except for body mass index, body surface area, serum triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose (P > 0.05). They also significantly differed in the use of all major classes of antihypertensive drugs (P < 0.001), except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = 0.58).

Table 1.
Clinical characteristics of patients by echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy status

Table 2 shows the echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular structure and function in the 3 groups of patients. Patients with concentric LVH had the greatest IVSTd, posterior wall thickness, RWT, LVM, and LVMI. Patients with eccentric LVH had the greatest left ventricular diastolic and systolic diameters and lowest left ventricular ejection fraction.

Table 2.
Left ventricular structure and function by echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy status

Sensitivity and specificity of various ECG criteria

The cutoff values for these 7 ECG criteria and sensitivity and specificity of various ECG criteria for echocardiographic LVH are shown in Table 3. In general, all ECG criteria had low sensitivity (15%–31.9%) and high specificity (91.6%–99.2%), especially for eccentric LVH. Regardless of the LVH pattern, the Cornell product criterion had the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of LVH (43.5% and 23.1% for concentric and eccentric LVH, respectively). ECG diagnosis of LVH according to any of the 4 ECG criteria including the Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had similar sensitivity (54% vs. 56.8% for overall, 71.7% vs. 72.8% for concentric LVH, and 40.5% vs. 44.6% for eccentric LVH) and specificity (86.3% vs. 83.4%) as any of all 7 ECG criteria.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^115jdYoF]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although the Sokolow–Lyon and Cornell criteria are frequently used in clinical practice and appear widely in international guidelines, in the modern era of increasing obesity, their diagnostic accuracy is well below an acceptable level for a diagnostic screening tool. This study has shown that by incorporating BMI into the ECG algorithm by a simple adjustment, the diagnostic sensitivity can be improved without a significant decrease in specificity.

The challenges of ECG screening for LVH in the modern population

In current practice, LVH is most accurately determined by CMR, as its accuracy far exceeds that of either echocardiography or ECG. However, the greater availability, simplicity of operation and lower cost associated with the ECG have resulted in its continued worldwide use. However, obesity affects the surface ECG significantly, reducing voltage amplitude through a combination of leftward LV axis deviation, increased chest wall fat and increased pericardial fat. In this study, obesity was observed to reduce the sum of the R wave amplitude in V5 or 6 and the S wave in V1 by up to 8 mm. Indeed, we demonstrate that the sensitivity of the Sokolow–Lyon criteria is only 3.1% in obesity, with a specificity reaching 99.0%. Although the specificity seems excellent, this likely reflects the fact that in obesity the degree of LVH required to generate > 35 mm Sokolow–Lyon index is much greater, reducing its diagnostic power (reflected by the Youden index of 0.11). It is quite clear from this study that the Sokolow–Lyon criteria are completely inadequate to be used as a diagnostic screening test in the modern era of obesity. Although the Cornell criteria are seen here to be less vulnerable to increasing BMI, they also have poor diagnostic sensitivity (14.8% and 11.9%, respectively).

### Addition of highly sensitive troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide to electrocardiography for detection of left ventricular hypertrophy: results from the Dallas heart study [^115DfHMG]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, current screening strategies are limited. In 2478 participants without clinical disease from the Dallas Heart Study, we evaluated a multimarker screening strategy that complements electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for LVH with 2 biomarkers, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and highly sensitive cardiac troponin T. An integer LVH risk score from 0 to 3 was determined as the sum of the following: (1) LVH by Sokolow-Lyon ECG; (2) amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in the highest sex-specific quartile; and (3) detectable cardiac troponin T. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-determined LVH served as the primary outcome. The probability of LVH increased from 2% with an LVH risk score of 0 to 50% with a score of 3 (P < 0.001). Sokolow-Lyon ECG afforded low sensitivity (26% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 17–32%]) and high specificity (96% [95% CI, 95–97%]), whereas a risk score ≥ 2 offered higher sensitivity (44% [95% CI, 34–51%]) with good specificity (90% [95% CI, 89–93%]) and a score threshold of 1 offered reasonable sensitivity (76% [95% CI, 67–83%]) with lower specificity (55% [95% CI, 53–61%]) and high negative predictive value (98% [95% CI, 97–98%]). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve improved from 0.760 (95% CI, 0.716–0.804) for ECG alone to 0.798 (95% CI, 0.754–0.842) for the LVH risk score (P = 0.0012), consistent with modest improvement in overall discrimination. Better screening for LVH may be achieved by combining simple tests, which collectively provide additional information compared with ECG alone. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multimarker screening strategy.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^116S1EnL]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Results

CMR-derived and ECG-derived LVH for the initial study cohort

Of the 821 participants, 172 had CMR-defined LVH (21.0%). Despite an increase in LV mass with obesity (22 g, p < 0.001), Sokolow–Lyon index voltage criteria decreased by 4 mm (p < 0.001) and Cornell criteria did not increase (p > 0.99, table 1). This suggests that both criteria are significantly affected by obesity and that the Sokolow–Lyon would be more suitable for a BMI adjustment factor.

The effect of obesity on diagnostic accuracy of ECG criteria

The Sokolow–Lyon criteria had poor sensitivity of 14.7% (CI 10.0% to 20.8%) but excellent specificity of 96.7% (95.1% to 97.8%) for the detection of CMR-determined LVH. Overall, diagnostic accuracy was very poor; ROC area under curve (AUC) was 0.55, Youden index was 0.11 (CI 0.05 to 0.16), positive predictive value was 0.52 (CI 0.37 to 0.67) and negative predictive value was 0.81 (CI 0.78 to 0.83) (figure 3).

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^113RarbY]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ECG criteria for LVH severely underestimate the prevalence of anatomical LVH, especially in the setting of obesity. We propose a simple adjustment of the ECG Sokolow–Lyon criteria (+4 mm in overweight, +8 mm in obesity) that improves the diagnostic sensitivity for the detection of anatomical LVH without significantly decreasing the diagnostic specificity.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^117UYkKD]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Performance of electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in Chinese hypertensive patients is not well known. We investigated the accuracy of various ECG criteria for the diagnosis of the echocardiographic LVH according to the new cutoff values of left ventricular mass (LVM) index (> 115 g/m² for men and > 95 g/m² for women) in Chinese hypertensive patients.

METHODS

Our study included 702 consecutive hypertensive inpatients including 92 (13.1%) concentric and 121 (17.2%) eccentric LVH on standard echocardiography. Diagnostic accuracy of 7 ECG criteria was evaluated by calculating sensitivity and specificity and by using the receiver operating characteristic curves.

RESULTS

The ECG criteria for the detection of the echocardiographically defined LVH had a sensitivity of 15%–31.9% and specificity of 91.6%–99.2% overall, 20.7%–43.5% and 91.6%–99.2% concentric, and 7.4%–23.1% and 91.6%–99.2% eccentric. ECG diagnosis of LVH defined as the positive diagnosis of any of 4 ECG criteria including Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 86.3% overall, 71.7% and 86.3% concentric, and 40.5% and 86.3% eccentric. After adjustment for confounding factors, various ECG criteria were significantly correlated with LVM, with standardized β coefficients from 0.20 to 0.39 (P < 0.001) and the highest coefficient for the Cornell product criterion.

CONCLUSIONS

All ECG LVH indexes had low sensitivity and high specificity in Chinese hypertensive patients. Combination of 4 or all ECG criteria might improve sensitivity without any loss of specificity.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^114NhW2M]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Electrocardiography is the first-choice technique for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with arterial hypertension. It is necessary to know the probable outcome for every patient during the treatment, with the aim of improving cardiovascular event prevention.

Hypothesis

Certain electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy may predict outcomes of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy during a 15-year follow-up.

Methods

Fifteen-year prospective study of 83 consecutive patients (53 male and 30 female; mean age 55.3 ± 8.1) with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index 170.3 ± 31.6 g/m²). Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy was determined by means of Gubner-Ungerleider voltage, Lewis voltage, voltage of R wave in aVL lead, Lyon-Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage and Cornell product, voltage RV 6 and RV 5 ratio, Romhilt-Estes score, Framingham criterion and Perugia criterion.

Results

One or more composite events were registered in 32 (38.5%) patients during 15-year follow-up. Positive Lyon-Sokolow score (17.6% vs. 47.3%; P < 0.05), Lewis voltage (9.8% vs. 21.9%; P < 0.05), Cornell voltage (15.7% vs. 37.5%; P < 0.05), and Cornell product (9.8% vs. 34.4%; P < 0.01) were more frequent in a group of patients with composite events. Odd ratio for Cornell product was 4.819 (95% CI 1.486–15.627).

Conclusion

Patients with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy who had positive Lewis voltage, Lyon-Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage, and Cornell product showed worse 15-year outcome. The strongest predictor of cardiovascular events was positive result of Cornell product.

### Optimized electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity patients [^111SzQpL]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Despite a generally high specificity, electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) lack sensitivity, particularly in obesity patients.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of the most commonly used ECG criteria (Cornell voltage and Sokolow‐Lyon index), the recently introduced Peguero‐Lo Presti criteria and the correction of these criteria by body mass index (BMI) to detect LVH in obesity patients and to propose adjusted ECG criteria with optimal accuracy.

Methods

The accuracy of the ECG criteria for the detection of LVH was retrospectively tested in a cohort of obesity patients referred for a transthoracic echocardiogram based on clinical grounds (test cohort, n = 167). Adjusted ECG criteria with optimal sensitivity for the detection of LVH were developed. Subsequently, the value of these criteria was prospectively tested in an obese population without known cardiovascular disease (validation cohort, n = 100).

Results

Established ECG criteria had a poor sensitivity in obesity patients in both the test cohort and the validation cohort. The adjusted criteria showed improved sensitivity, with optimal values for males using the Cornell voltage corrected for BMI, (RaVL+SV3)*BMI ≥ 700 mm*kg/m 2; sensitivity 47% test cohort, 40% validation cohort; for females, the Sokolow‐Lyon index corrected for BMI, (SV1 + RV5/RV6)*BMI ≥ 885 mm*kg/m 2; sensitivity 26% test cohort, 23% validation cohort.

Conclusions

Established ECG criteria for the detection of LVH lack sufficient sensitivity in obesity patients. We propose new criteria for the detection of LVH in obesity patients with improved sensitivity, approaching known sensitivity of the most commonly used ECG criteria in lean subjects.

### The clinical value of apex beat and electrocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy from the standpoint of the distance factors from the heart to the chest wall: a multislice CT study [^111M1NMq]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Performance of the apex beat and ECG voltage criteria in the detection of LVH

Table 3 shows the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the pattern of sustained or double apical impulse and ECG voltage criteria, as indicators of anatomic LVH for the entire study population and in the obese and non-obese subgroups. For the entire study group (N = 151), the pattern of sustained or double apical impulse in the supine position as an indicator of LVH had sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 88%. Among patients (N = 47) with a palpable apex beat, the corresponding values were 90, 58, 63 and 88%, respectively. The Sokolow–Lyon voltage criteria had sensitivity of 53%, specificity of 79%, positive predictive value of 42% and negative predictive value of 85%. In contrast, the Cornell voltage criteria had sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value of 68% and negative predictive value of 88%. Further, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the Sokolow–Lyon voltage criteria in obese patients (BMI ≥ 25.0) were lower and the specificity and positive predictive value in these patients were higher than those in non-obese ones.

The combination of the patterns of sustained or double apical impulse or Sokolow–Lyon voltage criteria as indicators of LVH had a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 74%, a positive predictive value of 45% and a negative predictive value of 91%. Moreover, the combination of the patterns of sustained or double apical impulse or Cornell voltage criteria had a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 85%, a positive predictive value of 59% and a negative predictive value of 93%.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy identified by cardiac computed tomography and ECG in hypertensive individuals: a population-based study [^116Qmrii]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Screening of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a biomarker of organ damage in hypertensive individuals and associated with increased mortality. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is widely expanding worldwide; however, the value of CT assessment of LVH is unknown. We aimed to identify individuals with LVH using both cardiac CT and electrocardiograms (ECG) and to explore potential differences between these phenotypical distinct diagnostic modalities.

Methods

Participants in the Copenhagen General Population Study underwent 12-lead ECG and cardiac CT and were evaluated for the presence of LVH. Multiple ECG signs of LVH were compared with LVH by CT.

Results

Out of 4942 participants, 1347 had untreated hypertension and in this group, 13% presented with anatomical LVH by CT and 10% by ECG with an overlap of 4%. ECG signs of LVH had negative predictive values between 87 and 89% compared with CT. Using a combination of the Sokolow-Lyon index, the Cornell voltage duration product and/or a Romhilt-Estes score at least 4, lead to an increased C-statistics (P < 0.001) compared with the use of any single ECG sign of LVH. Individuals with solely CT but not ECG signs of LVH had higher SBPs (152 vs. 144mmHg, P < 0.001) and larger left atria (49 vs. 45ml/m, P < 0.001) compared with individuals with solely ECG LVH.

Conclusion

CT and ECG identifies LVH in 19% of hypertensive individuals with only a small diagnostic overlap. Commonly used ECG criteria for LVH cannot safely rule out the presence of anatomical LV organ damage.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^114zPyHc]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nowadays, numerous experts attempt to redefine the existing LVH criteria by using magnetic resonance as gold standard. Rodrigues et al. 19 noticed that obese individuals had less frequent LHV positive results in terms of voltage criterion and suggested their correction. The prognostic significance of this should be tested on large number of patients. Each positive step in terms of increasing sensitivity and preserving specificity had a significant clinical importance for this inexpensive and widely available diagnostic method. 20 Leese et al. 21 pointed out that combination of ECG and selective use of echocardiography could reduce the costs in the United States, which was supported by cost‐effectiveness analysis. On the other hand, European guidelines recommended that each patient should be subjected to echocardiography and electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy by means of corrected Lyon‐Sokolow criteria and Cornell product. 9 This study tested prognostic significance of large number of electrocardiographic criteria during a 15‐year patient treatment and follow‐up. The patients were divided into two groups based on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events which occurred during the study. All patients were treated in accordance with valid recommendations for treating hypertension and thus there were no statistically significant differences in terms of applied therapy. This was very important, since the evidence showed that the regression of LVH after hypertensive treatment was accompanied by improvement in prognosis. 22 This study showed no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of risk factors, BMI and blood pressure parameters, despite the fact that these factors might be responsible for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Recently published study indicated that visit‐to‐visit blood pressure variability was a predictor of cardiovascular risk category in general population. 23 Hansen et al. 24 showed that correlation between 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and LVH was better than the correlation between office‐measured blood pressure and LVH. The values of blood pressure were not good predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH, as it was shown in our 5‐year study. 4, 25

2.3 ECG recording and analysis

A standard 12‐lead ECG was recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/s and an amplification of 10 mm/mV. Heart rate, QRS duration, R‐wave and S‐wave heights, and QRS axis were measured. Left axis deviation was determined as QRS axis between −30° and −90°. Measurements were taken to the nearest 1 mm. The most commonly used ECG criteria were analyzed (Figure 1): the Cornell voltage, RaVL + SV3 (considered positive ≥ 28 mm in male subjects and ≥ 20 mm in female subjects) 9; Sokolow‐Lyon index, SV1 + RV5/RV6 (RV5 or RV6, whichever is greater; considered positive ≥ 35 mm) 10; the Peguero‐Lo Presti criteria, SV4 + Sdeepest (considered positive ≥ 28 mm in males and ≥ 23 mm in females) 16; and the correction of Cornell voltage by BMI, (RaVL + SV3)×BMI (considered positive ≥ 604 mm·kg/m²). 17 Finally, we multiplied the Sokolow‐Lyon index and Peguero‐Lo Presti criteria by BMI.

### Changes in electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and risk of major cardiovascular events in isolated systolic hypertension: the LIFE study [^117Ts6A7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The predictive value of changes in the severity of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) during antihypertensive therapy remains unclear in isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). In a Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension substudy, we included 1320 patients aged 54–83 years with systolic blood pressure (BP) of 160–200mmHg, diastolic BP < 90mmHg and ECG-LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria, randomized to losartan- or atenolol-based treatment with a mean follow-up of 4.8 years. The composite end point of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke occurred in 179 (13.6%) patients. In Cox regression models controlling for treatment, Framingham risk score, as well as baseline and in-treatment BP, less severe in-treatment ECG-LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage was associated with 17 and 25% risk reduction for the composite end point (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (95% CI:) 0.75–0.92, P = 0.001 per 1050mm × ms (1 s.d.) lower Cornell product; and HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65–0.87, P < 0.001 per 10.5mm (1 s.d.) lower Sokolow-Lyon voltage). In parallel analyses, lower Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage were associated with lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and MI, and lower Sokolow-Lyon voltage with lower risk of stroke. Lower Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage during antihypertensive therapy are associated with lower likelihoods of cardiovascular events in patients with ISH.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy by sokolow-Lyon voltage criterion predicts mortality in overweight hypertensive subjects [^111wHCuc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

In view of the low sensitivity of Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria in the assessment of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG LVH) in overweight subjects, we determined its clinical utility in 1840 lean and 3555 overweight subjects with hypertension. They were followed prospectively over an average of 11 years by the Department of Health and Social Security Hypertension Care Computer Project. LVH was determined at baseline using the Sokolow-Lyon criterion that is, the amplitude voltage SV1+(max RV5 or RV6) ≥ 3.5 mV. Overweight status was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg m(-2). Prevalence of ECG LVH was 16% in lean and 12% in overweight women, 35 and 20% in lean and overweight men. For each 0.1 mV increase in ECG voltage as a continuous variable, the age and sex adjusted risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality increased significantly by 3.0, 1.5 and 1.8% in overweight subjects and by 2.8, 1.8 and 2.4% in lean subjects. After additional adjustments for smoking, blood glucose and serum cholesterol concentration in a subgroup of 654 lean and 1281 overweight subjects with complete information on these variables, an increasing voltage still significantly predicted stroke and CVD mortality in overweight subjects. The excess high risk of dying was evident especially in women with LVH in the highest BMI quartiles. When ECG detects LVH in overweight subjects, it is a good predictor of mortality despite the lower sensitivity in this group.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^113xomdE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is common in patients with hypertension, and is associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Both electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography can be used for the diagnosis of LVH. Echocardiography has high sensitivity but limited availability and high technical requirement. In contrast, ECG is low cost and reproducible but has low sensitivity.ECG is a routine test for LVH detection in patients with hypertension in all major hypertension guidelines. It is recommended to every single hypertensive patient and especially suitable for LVH screening.

Several ECG criteria, such as the Sokolow–Lyon index, Cornell voltage or Cornell voltage duration product, and RavL, are available to assess LVH. Most of previous studies have been conducted in Caucasians, and the diagnostic performance of ECG criteria for Asians especially Chinese remains under investigation. A few previous studies of small sample size evaluated correlation between ECG criteria and LVH diagnosed with the old echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI) cutoff values (> 125 g/m 2 for men and > 120 g/m 2 for women) and showed inconsistent sensitivity and specificity in the Chinese population. Recent hypertension guidelines reduced the LVMI cutoff values of echocardiographic LVH diagnostic criteria to > 115 g/m 2 for men and > 95 g/m 2 for women. In the present study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of these ECG criteria for the diagnosis of the newly defined echocardiographic LVH including both concentric and eccentric patterns in Chinese adult hypertensive patients.

### ECG left ventricular hypertrophy is a stronger risk factor for incident cardiovascular events in women than in men in the general population [^114mxnLs]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular events. ECG is the most widely used method for LVH detection. Despite the abundance of ECG LVH criteria, their prognostic values have been compared in only a few studies, and little has been known about how sex modifies the prognostic value of LVH. We assessed the relationship between ECG LVH and incident cardiovascular events in the general population.

Methods

Several ECG LVH criteria were measured in 3059 women and 2456 men participating in the Health 2000 Study - a national general population survey. Association between ECG LVH and cardiovascular events were analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models.

Results

ECG LVH was more prevalent in women than in men when measured with Cornell-based criteria, but less prevalent or nondifferent when measured with other criteria. The association between ECG LVH and events showed higher hazard ratios for women than in men. Sex×LVH interaction terms were statistically significant in part of the LVH criteria. In adjusted Cox models, Sokolow-Lyon voltage performed the best. The composite of Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell voltage was statistically significantly associated with events in both sexes.

Conclusion

Sex affects both the prevalence rates and prognostic values of ECG LVH criteria in the general population, while showing higher prognostic value of ECG LVH in women than in men. For clinical use, the composite of the Sokolow-Lyon voltage and the Cornell voltage seems to be a good option.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy: an ECG-based study of prevalence and risk factors in a multiethnic population [^117X6SJ6]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that the presence of LVH associated strongly with the degree of blood pressure control. Furthermore, Creole ethnicity and educational level were important determinants of LVH, even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.

The age-standardised prevalence of LVH in our study was 9%. In a review comparing 26 ECG-LVH studies with 40 444 individuals, the average prevalence of LVH was 18%. However, all individuals had hypertension, a well-known risk factor for developing LVH. Our study included both normotensive and hypertensive individuals which could explain a lower prevalence. Furthermore, the previously mentioned studies included several other criteria for detecting LVH, such as Minnesota codes, Romhilt-Estes, etcwhile we used Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell voltage and Cornell product. A cross-sectional population-based study from Thailand showed a lower prevalence (6%) of LVH. However, that study used only the Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell voltage criteria. In our study, the majority of individuals with LVH were detected with Cornell product. The Cornell criteria has in other studies been shown to detect a higher rate of LVH compared with the Sokolow-Lyon criteria.

### The effect of obesity on electrocardiographic detection of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy: recalibration against cardiac magnetic resonance [^1113RzNJ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Arterial hypertension and obesity commonly coexist. The latter has been associated with increased LVM and increased prevalence of LVH independent of hypertension. However, previous echocardiographic studies into the impact of obesity on the diagnostic performance of the ECG at detecting LVH have demonstrated conflicting results.,

Consequently, the aim of our study was to evaluate the Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Sokolow–Lyon product, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, Gubner–Ungerleider voltage and Romhilt–Estes ECG criteria for LVH in a cohort of tertiary hypertensive clinic patients, with high prevalence of LVH, relative to SSFP CMR measurements of LVM. We also aimed to investigate the effect of obesity and LV remodeling on the ECG criteria for LVH and generate new obesity-specific partition values, by recalibrating the criteria against the current noninvasive gold-standard technique to measure LVM.

Results

Established ECG criteria had a poor sensitivity in obesity patients in both the test cohort and the validation cohort. The adjusted criteria showed improved sensitivity, with optimal values for males using the Cornell voltage corrected for BMI, (RaVL+SV3)*BMI ≥ 700mm*kg/m 2; sensitivity 47% test cohort, 40% validation cohort; for females, the Sokolow-Lyon index corrected for BMI, (SV1+RV5/RV6)*BMI ≥ 885mm*kg/m 2; sensitivity 26% test cohort, 23% validation cohort.

Conclusions

Established ECG criteria for the detection of LVH lack sufficient sensitivity in obesity patients. We propose new criteria for the detection of LVH in obesity patients with improved sensitivity, approaching known sensitivity of the most commonly used ECG criteria in lean subjects.

### Distinct role of electrocardiographic criteria in echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy according to age, in the general population: the ikaria study [^114bCLfv]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The age-dependent performance of electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria was examined for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) prediction.

Methods

During 2009, 570 middle-aged (54 ± 7 years, 45% men) and 507 elderly (75 ± 6 years, 45% men) inhabitants of the Ikaria Island were studied. Seven ECG criteria were calculated (Sokolow-Lyon voltage and product, sex-specific Cornell voltage and product, Gubner-Ungerleider voltage, Lewis voltage and Framingham), whereas LVH was defined as left ventricular mass indexed for body surface area (BSA) at least 125g/m in men and at least 110g/m in women or left ventricular mass indexed for height 49g/m or more in men and 45g/m or more in women.

Results

The Framingham criteria had in hierarchical order the highest, although insignificant, sensitivity among the elderly individuals, either when LVH was indexed for BSA or for height (18.4 and 16.7%, respectively). Cornell voltage and product criteria had hierarchically the highest sensitivity among middle-aged participants, either when LVH was indexed for BSA (19.0 and 23.8%, respectively) or for height (17.2 and 20.3%, respectively). In the multiadjusted analysis applied in elderly participants, Cornell voltage, its product and Framingham criteria were associated with echocardiographic detection of LVH (indexed for BSA); however, when LVH was indexed for height, the Sokolow-Lyon and Framingham criteria were associated with LVH detection. In contrast, among middle-aged individuals, the Cornell product was the only ECG criterion that was associated with LVH detection (irrespective of indexation).

Conclusion

Age should be taken into consideration in selection of appropriate ECG criteria for LVH detection. Indexation of left ventricular mass differentiates the diagnostic ability of ECG criteria, especially in older patients.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^113g74bA]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Electrocardiography is the first‐choice technique for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with arterial hypertension. It is necessary to know the probable outcome for every patient during the treatment, with the aim of improving cardiovascular event prevention.

Hypothesis

Certain electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy may predict outcomes of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy during a 15‐year follow‐up.

Methods

Fifteen‐year prospective study of 83 consecutive patients (53 male and 30 female; mean age 55.3 ± 8.1) with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index 170.3 ± 31.6 g/m 2). Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy was determined by means of Gubner‐Ungerleider voltage, Lewis voltage, voltage of R wave in aVL lead, Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage and Cornell product, voltage RV 6 and RV 5 ratio, Romhilt‐Estes score, Framingham criterion and Perugia criterion.

Results

One or more composite events were registered in 32 (38.5%) patients during 15‐year follow‐up. Positive Lyon‐Sokolow score (17.6% vs. 47.3%; P < 0.05), Lewis voltage (9.8% vs. 21.9%; P < 0.05), Cornell voltage (15.7% vs. 37.5%; P < 0.05), and Cornell product (9.8% vs. 34.4%; P < 0.01) were more frequent in a group of patients with composite events. Odd ratio for Cornell product was 4.819 (95% CI 1.486‐15.627).

Conclusion

Patients with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy who had positive Lewis voltage, Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage, and Cornell product showed worse 15‐year outcome. The strongest predictor of cardiovascular events was positive result of Cornell product.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^111praEd]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of anatomical axis deviation on ECG voltage criteria

In order to determine the effect of an increasing leftward anatomical axis on ECG voltage criteria, subjects were matched for both LV mass and BMI. This showed that, for a given LV mass and BMI, a leftward deviation of the LV anatomical axis was associated with a significant decrease in Sokolow–Lyon amplitude (by 3–5 mm, p < 0.05 all analyses). Similar results were seen using ANCOVA analysis investigating the effects of LV axis deviation on ECG criteria (covariates in model evaluated at LV mass 133 g, BMI 28.2 kg/m 2 (mean values for the cohort)) with reducing Sokolow–Lyon voltage with increasing lateral axis displacement (lowest tertile 22.6 mm, middle tertile 21.5 mm, obese 18.9 mm, all post hoc comparisons p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in Cornell criteria (p > 0.99 all analyses).

The effect of obesity on ECG voltage criteria

In order to determine the effect of obesity per se, subjects were matched for both LV mass and LV anatomical axis. This showed that, for any given LV mass and anatomical orientation, increasing BMI is associated with a significant decrease in Sokolow–Lyon index (overweight by 2–4 mm, obese by 3–5 mm, p < 0.05 all analyses). Similar results were seen using ANCOVA analysis investigating the effects of obesity on ECG criteria (covariates in model evaluated at LV mass 133 g, LV coronal axis 37° (mean values for the cohort)) with reducing Sokolow–Lyon index with increasing BMI (normal 23.0 mm, overweight 20.6 mm, obese 19.5 mm, all post hoc comparisons p < 0.05).

Defining a BMI adjustment factor for the Sokolow–Lyon index

The adjustment factors for the overweight and obese cohorts were calculated as the maximum sum of the effects of both BMI and leftward anatomical LV axis deviation. This showed that when matched for LV mass, on average, a 4 mm reduction in ECG voltage amplitude was observed in overweight and an 8 mm reduction was observed with obesity. As no significant change in Cornell criteria was observed with increasing BMI, no adjustment factor was calculated.

### Microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study [^113p2ruW]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Left ventricular hypertrophy and albuminuria have both been shown to predict increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the relationship between these markers of cardiac and renal glomerular damage has not been evaluated in a large hypertensive population with target organ damage. The present study was undertaken to determine whether albuminuria is associated with persistent electrocardiographic (ECG) left ventricular hypertrophy, independent of established risk factors for cardiac hypertrophy, in a large hypertensive population with left ventricular hypertrophy who were free of overt renal failure.

Methods

Patients with stage II-III hypertension were enrolled in the study if they had left ventricular hypertrophy on a screening ECG by Cornell voltage-duration product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria, and clinic blood pressures between 160 and 200/95–115 mmHg and plasma creatinine < 160 mmol/l. A second ECG and morning spot urine were obtained after 14 days of placebo treatment. Renal glomerular permeability was evaluated by urine albumin/creatinine (UACR, mg/mmol). Microalbuminuria was present if UACR > 3.5 mg/mmol and macroalbuminuria if UACR > 35 mg/mmol.

Results

The mean age of the 8029 patients was 66 years, 54% were women. Microalbuminuria was found in 23% and macroalbuminuria in 4% of patients. Microalbuminuria was more prevalent in patients of African American (35%), Hispanic (37%) and Asian (36%) ethnicity, heavy smokers (32%), diabetics (36%) and in patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy by both ECG-criteria (29%). Urine albumin/creatinine was positively related to Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria and Cornell voltage-duration product criteria. In multiple regression analysis, higher UACR was independently associated with older age, diabetes, higher blood pressure, serum creatinine, smoking and left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients smoking > 20 cigarettes/day had a 1.6-fold higher prevalence of microalbuminuria and a 3.7-fold higher prevalence of macroalbuminuria than never-smokers. ECG left ventricular hypertrophy by Cornell voltage-duration product or Sokolow-Lyon criteria was associated with a 1.6-fold increased prevalence of microalbuminuria and a 2.6-fold increase risk of macroalbuminuria compared to no left ventricular hypertrophy on the second ECG.

Conclusions

In patients with moderately severe hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy on two consecutive ECGs is associated with increased prevalences of micro- and macroalbuminuria compared to patients without persistent ECG left ventricular hypertrophy. High albumin excretion was related to left ventricular hypertrophy independent of age, blood pressure, diabetes, race, serum creatinine or smoking, suggesting parallel cardiac damage and albuminuria.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and incident cognitive decline in older adults with hypertension [^114RjaQh]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that we found only CP-LVH to be consistently associated with cognitive decline and the accuracy of ECG defined LVH criteria may need to be taken into account. Although a 1990's study using autopsy as a gold-standard for diagnosis of LVH reported CP having a specificity of 95% and identifying LVH with greater sensitivity than CV (51% versus 36%) a more recent study has reported similar sensitivity and specificity for CP and CV in detecting magnetic resonance imaging defined LVH, whereas Sokolow-Lyon criterion had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity. When assessed by echocardiography, combined LVH prevalence was 36% among adults with hypertension aged 44–67 years in a systematic review. The prevalence of LVH in our study was less than a-third of that number. Notably, comparing the point estimates for odds ratios, greater increased risk of cognitive impairment among individuals with LVH than without LVH was found when assessing LVH by echocardiography than ECG. Therefore, although echocardiography is less affordable as a routine basic screening test, it may be a better assessment tool for LVH to predict cognitive function.

### Prognostic value of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy on cardiovascular risk in a non-hypertensive community-based population [^111z7RKC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The appearance of left ventricular hypertrophy on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG-LVH) has been clarified to be associated with the risk of incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hypertensive individuals and the general population, but not enough in non-hypertensive individuals.

Methods

A total of 4,927 non-hypertensive individuals ≥ 40 years of age who were free of CVE in the general population were followed for the incidence of CVE. ECG-LVH was defined according to criteria of the Sokolow-Lyon (SL) voltage, Cornell voltage (CV), or Cornell voltage product (CP).

Results

During the average 9.8 ± 2.0 years of follow-up, 267 individuals (5.4%) had their first CVE. The hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of CVE after full adjustment by potential confounders significantly increased in the individuals with ECG-LVH by any criteria of the SL voltage, CV, and CP (HR = 1.77, P < 0.001) compared to those with no ECG-LVH. This association was also significant in individuals without any of obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus or those with systolic blood pressure (BP) < 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 80 mm Hg. Furthermore, ECG-LVH by each criteria provided the reclassification improvement for the CVE risk prediction model by the Framingham 10-year risk score (the net reclassification improvement = 0.17–0.22, each P value < 0.010).

Conclusions

In the absence of hypertension, ECG-LVH parameters are associated with the increased risk of developed CVEs independent of the established risk factors and provide the additional prognostic value in an assessment of the CVE risk using the traditional risk factors.

### Four ECG left ventricular hypertrophy criteria and the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease [^114THSYY]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The relation between different electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) criteria and cardiovascular risk in patients with clinical manifest arterial disease is unclear. Therefore, we determined the association between four ECG-LVH criteria: Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell product, Cornell/strain index and Framingham criterion; and risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in this population.

Methods

Risk of cardiovascular events was estimated in 6913 adult patients with clinical manifest arterial disease originating from the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort. Cox proportional regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of the four ECG-LVH criteria and the primary composite outcome: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cardiovascular death; and secondary outcomes: MI, stroke and all-cause mortality; adjusted for confounders.

Results

The highest prevalence of ECG-LVH was observed for Cornell product (10%) and Cornell/strain index (9%). All four ECG-LVH criteria were associated with an increased risk of the primary composite endpoint: Sokolow-Lyon (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.13–1.66), Cornell product (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.30–1.82), Cornell/strain index (hazard ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.44–2.00) and Framingham criterion (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.21–2.62). Cornell product, Cornell/strain index and Framingham criterion ECG-LVH were additionally associated with an elevated risk of secondary outcomes. Cardiovascular risk increased whenever two, or three or more ECG-LVH criteria were present concurrently.

Conclusion

All four ECG-LVH criteria are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. As Cornell/strain index is both highly prevalent and carries a high cardiovascular risk, this is likely the most relevant ECG-LVH criterion for clinical practice.

### Optimized electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity patients [^112K1HLQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of obesity has increased rapidly, and nowadays more people are obese than underweight. 1 Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs frequently in obesity patients, even in the absence of comorbidities such as hypertension 2, 3 and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, morbidity, and mortality. 4, 5, 6 Although echocardiography is a more sensitive tool to identify LVH, the standard electrocardiogram (ECG) remains widely used, because of its established clinical value, broad availability, and low costs. 7 ECG criteria for the diagnosis of LVH have been used since 1914. 8 Nowadays, the two most commonly used ECG criteria are the Cornell voltage 9 and the Sokolow‐Lyon index. 10 Despite a generally high specificity, most ECG criteria for LVH lack sensitivity. 11 The value of these criteria is particularly questionable in obesity patients 12, 13 because obesity is responsible for geometrical and electrophysiological changes of the heart and ECG voltages may be attenuated by subcutaneous adipose tissue. 14, 15 Recently, Peguero and Lo‐Presti introduced more sensitive ECG criteria for the detection of LVH. 16 Until now, these criteria have not been specifically tested in obese subjects. Finally, Angeli et al. 17 introduced a correction to the Cornell voltage by body mass index (BMI) to improve the performance of traditional ECG criteria.

The aim of the current study was to retrospectively evaluate the accuracy of various ECG criteria to detect LVH in obesity patients and to propose adjusted ECG criteria with optimal sensitivity for this group of patients. Subsequently, the identified optimal criteria were prospectively tested in an obese population without suspicion of or known cardiovascular disease.

### Prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in Finnish primary health care hypertensive patients [^113Y6mTU]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive patients who present left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are at considerable risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Echocardiography, being the best method for assessing of LVH, is too expensive for routine daily practice particularly in primary health care. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG) still remains the most feasible method to assess LVH in these settings.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ECG-LVH in Finnish hypertensive primary health care patients and evaluate the quality of their blood pressure control.

Methods

A total of 255 general practitioners in 26 primary health care centres identified all of their hypertensive patients visiting during a 1-week period. A health examination was carried out on these patients by health nurses and laboratory tests, including ECG, were taken. The ECG's were analysed by using the Minnesota Code. Altogether, 1746 hypertensive patients were examined.

Results

The prevalence of ECG-LVH when using Sokolow-Lyon criterion was 9.8% for males and 5.7% for females. The corresponding figures, when using the sex-specific Cornell product, were 14.9% for males and 18.8% for females. Only 17% of LVH patients had their blood pressure under good control (BP < 140/90 mm Hg) as compared to 25% of non-LVH patients (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

The prevalence of ECG-LVH in Finnish hypertensive primary health care patients is high. Despite this warning signal, the treatment situation for LVH patients was even worse than that of other hypertensives.

3.4 Prospective validation of the adjusted criteria for detection of LVH in obesity patients (validation cohort)

When the new criteria were tested in the validation cohort, again the adjusted Cornell voltage*BMI had the best sensitivity for males (40%, CI: 7%‐83%), specificity 92% (CI: 71%‐99%), ROC AUC 0.78, PPV 50% (CI: 9%‐91%), and NPV 88% (CI: 68%‐97%). The Sokolow‐Lyon index*BMI again had the best sensitivity for females (23%, CI: 6%‐54%), specificity 83% (CI: 70%‐91%), ROC AUC 0.57, PPV 25% (CI: 7‐57%), and NPV 81% (CI: 68%‐90%). None of the male patients in the validation cohort had a positive Sokolow‐Lyon index at a cut‐off value of 27 mm. There were no substantial differences between the sensitivity and specificity in the test cohort and validation cohort.

### Combining ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy improves risk prediction in patients with hypertension [^114wDvzZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hypertension with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but single ECG criteria may underestimate risk. Whether continued presence or new development of ECG LVH by 2 criteria can further concentrate risk during blood pressure lowering is unclear.

Methods and Results

Incident stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, the composite of these outcomes, and all-cause mortality were examined in relation to the presence of on-treatment ECG LVH by Cornell product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage during a mean of 4.8 ± 0.9 years follow-up in 9193 patients with hypertension randomized to losartan- or atenolol-based regimens. Patients were categorized into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of ECG LVH by each criterion at baseline and yearly during the study. At baseline, LVH by both criteria was present in 960 patients (10.4%). Compared with the absence of ECG LVH by both criteria, persistence or development of ECG LVH by both criteria entered as a time-varying covariate was associated with > 3-fold increased risks of events in multivariable Cox analyses adjusting for randomized treatment, baseline risk factors, and on-treatment heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Patients with ECG LVH by either Cornell product or Sokolow-Lyon voltage had 45% to 140% higher risks of all end points.

Conclusions

Persistence or development of ECG LVH by both Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria during antihypertensive therapy is associated with markedly increased risks of cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality. Further study is indicated to determine whether additional therapy in these patients can reduce their risk.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^116fcVqc]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) diagnostic criteria based on QRS voltage emphasize standardized measurement and classic lead-sum formulas: amplitudes are measured so that 10 mm equals 1 mV; 1 mm equals 0.1 mV, and commonly used definitions include the Sokolow-Lyon sum of SV1 and RV5 or RV6 and the Cornell voltage using the sum of SV3 and RaVL. Across criteria, diagnostic performance varies, with sensitivity generally quite low (usually less than 50%) and specificity often high (often in the range of 85% to 90%); concordance can be limited, as only 11.2% of patients met both Cornell and Sokolow-Lyon criteria in a hypertensive cohort. Published studies are currently insufficient to indicate superiority among newer criteria, and interpretations should specify which criteria are used in making a diagnosis and automated systems should apply multiple criteria. QRS voltages are influenced by noncardiac factors including age, gender, race, and body habitus; day-to-day variability and electrode placement also impact voltages and the diagnostic value of ECG voltage criteria. By age, commonly used QRS voltage criteria apply to adults older than 35 years, whereas standards for the 16- to 35-year age group are not as well-established and voltage-only diagnosis is of low accuracy. By gender, adult women have a slightly lower upper limit of QRS voltage than men and SV1 is the only measurement with a large difference. By race, African-Americans have higher upper normal limits than Euro-Americans and Hispanic Americans have lower limits; in mild or moderate hypertension Sokolow-Lyon shows higher sensitivity and lower specificity in African-Americans than in Euro-Americans, whereas Cornell shows lower sensitivity and higher specificity. Obesity is associated with increased left ventricular mass by echocardiography but not increased QRS voltage.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^116k1T3M]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Adjusting the ECG for obesity

It has previously been shown that the diagnostic sensitivity of the ECG can be improved by accounting for obesity. However, prior studies have either used 2D echocardiography to determine LV mass, which itself is limited in obesityor have used complex adjustment equations based on regression, which are unsuited to time-limited modern clinical medicine. This is the first study to use CMR to investigate the effects of both obesity and associated leftward LV axis deviation on ECG LVH criteria. We have shown that being overweight reduces the Sokolow–Lyon voltage by on average 4 mm and obese by 8 mm. When using a correction factor of +4 mm in overweight and +8 mm in obesity, the diagnostic sensitivity of this criteria is increased (by up to 30% in overweight) and to a level that approaches that seen in normal weight. Importantly, although specificity for LVH does decrease after adjustment (by up to 5.5%), it remains excellent (92.9–97.9%).

Given the global utilisation of this criteria as well as the worldwide increase in obesity, this finding is of significant clinical impact and should allow a substantial increase in the detection of anatomical LVH using ECG screening. As ECG-determined LVH appears in both European and US guidelinesand is known to predict mortality, improving ECG diagnostic performance should quickly translate into significant patient benefit. However, despite these significant improvements, the sensitivity of the ECG remains poor at around 30%. In the current era, this is a level that would preclude the ECG being taken up as a screening tool for LVH if presented as a novel diagnostic test.

Results

Performance of Individual LVH-ECG Parameters

Table 3 reports the diagnostic performance of all ECG parameters for different age groups and for the total study population, taking LVM+ as LVH definition. In the complete set (0–15 years), the additional version of the Sokolow-Lyon parameter (SV3R + RV7) performs best, with 25.3% sensitivity. Multiplying by QRS duration or taking the voltage-time integral does not improve this criterion. However, there is an increase in sensitivity of 31% by the area version compared to the amplitude-only version of the 12-lead sum in the complete set (p = 0.045).

Table 3
Sensitivity (%) at 95% specificity for three age groups and for the total population taking left ventricular mass index > 3 as definition of left ventricular hypertrophy

The effect of age on the results is mixed. For different age groups different parameters perform best, and the improvement of the 12-lead sum is not consistent in all age groups. However, this may be accounted for by the lower number of LVH cases in the higher age groups. For SV1, SV3R, RV6, RV7, TV6, and (SV1 + RV6) × QRS duration, an increasing performance is seen with age. In all age groups, SV3R appears to perform better than SV1, and RV7 better than RV6.

Table 4 reports the diagnostic performance of the individual ECG parameters for the different definitions of LVH. The sensitivity of all ECG criteria improves considerably when, apart from LVM+, the clinical evidence of LVH is also entered in the definition of LVH. The more certain the cardiologists were about the presence of LVH, the better the ECG performs. The additional Sokolow-Lyon criterion (SV3R + RV7) performs best for all reference standards. Removal of all LVH cases from the LVM+, L2 group which were also marked by at least one cardiologist as probable RVH (n = 15) hardly changed the performance of the parameters.

### Association of heart failure hospitalizations with combined electrocardiography and echocardiography criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy [^113MJLjv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The value of performing echocardiography in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is uncertain.

Methods

Baseline echo- and electrocardiographic data and cardiovascular events over 4.8 years study treatment were assessed in 922 hypertensive patients in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension echocardiography substudy. Patients were grouped according to presence of LVH on both electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (n = 515), only on ECG (n = 172), only on echocardiogram (n = 135), or on none tests (n = 100). LVH was diagnosed by Sokolow Lyon and Cornell product criteria by electrocardiography and as LV mass index > 116 g/m² in men and > 104 g/m² in women by echocardiography.

Results

Patients with LVH on both tests were older, had higher systolic blood pressure and LV mass, lower LV systolic function, and included more patients with aortic regurgitation, albuminuria, and history of ischemic heart disease (all P < 0.05). Incidence of combined myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death did not differ between groups. Incidence of hospitalization for heart failure was 5.3 and 2.6 times higher in patients with LVH on both tests compared to patients with LVH on ECG or echocardiogram only (P < 0.01). In Cox regression, LVH on both tests predicted hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio 4.29 (95% confidence interval 1.26–14.65), P = 0.020) independent of other covariates including study treatment allocation and history of ischemic heart disease.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that combining LVH assessment on a single ECG and echocardiogram provides a simple tool for additional heart failure risk stratification in asymptomatic high-risk hypertensive patients.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy determined by sokolow-Lyon criteria: a different predictor in women than in men? [^117Tffdn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical usefulness of the Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria in the assessment of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG LVH) is addressed. We prospectively studied 3,338 women and 3,330 men referred with hypertension, with an average follow-up of 11.2 years. The voltage amplitude sum SV1+max (RV5 or RV6) was calculated and ECG LVH was defined as a sum ≥ 3.5 mV. We adjusted survival for age, treatment status before presentation and a previous myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. The risk of stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality increased significantly for each quantitative 0.1 mV increase in baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) voltage, in women within the range of 1.6–3.9% and in men 1.4–3.0%. After further adjustments for race, body mass index, smoking and systolic blood pressure, increasing voltage independently predicted CVD mortality in both men and women. In women, both increasing voltage and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were predictors of stroke mortality, whereas in men this risk was attenuated. In men, the adjusted association between increasing voltage and CHD mortality tended to be stronger than in women. The use of different thresholds for the two genders made little difference. For stroke and CHD mortality, the population attributable fractions associated with LVH were 15.2 and 5.4% in women and 12.8 and 8.5% in men, respectively. In conclusion, the greater the baseline ECG voltage sum, the greater the associated CVD mortality risk. Women tended to have a high risk of stroke mortality owing to LVH despite adjustments.
