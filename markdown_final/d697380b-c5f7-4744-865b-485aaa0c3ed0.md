## Question

Can HCTZ cause hyponatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) can cause hyponatremia and how confident we can be about this, including mechanisms, risk quantification, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of HCTZ and whether it plausibly impairs free water excretion. Then, I should verify the strength of epidemiologic evidence linking HCTZ to hyponatremia. Next, I will examine mechanistic pathways that explain thiazide-induced hyponatremia. After that, I should quantify risk and identify patient-level risk modifiers. Finally, I will review guideline positions and outline practical monitoring and management steps, including how to differentiate thiazide-associated hyponatremia from SIADH and what to do if it occurs.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic plausibility. HCTZ inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, which reduces sodium reabsorption and impairs the kidney's ability to generate free water, thereby predisposing to water retention relative to solute and potentially causing dilutional hyponatremia. This mechanism is well-described in endocrine and nephrology literature and aligns with the drug's known effects on urinary dilution and sodium handling [^116mPvxH] [^111oUoRs].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic signal before drawing conclusions. Multiple population-based studies and large observational datasets consistently associate thiazides, including HCTZ, with hyponatremia; for example, a 2024 Danish target-trial emulation found a 2-year cumulative incidence of hyponatremia of about 3.5% with HCTZ-containing regimens versus RAS inhibitor alone, with hazard ratios around 4.25 in the first 30 days, and a large U.S. LEGEND analysis found chlorthalidone had a higher hyponatremia risk than HCTZ, reinforcing a class effect and dose–potency relationship; earlier cohorts also reported higher incidence estimates, though definitions and settings varied, so I should be cautious about absolute rates while accepting the directionality of risk [^114CVTvy] [^113Qw3rs] [^111CrsJb] [^116hukLw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without integrating the clinical phenotypes. Thiazide-associated hyponatremia can present as hypovolemic hyponatremia from natriuresis and volume depletion, or as euvolemic, SIADH-like hyponatremia with impaired free water excretion despite low or suppressed AVP; contributing factors include increased water intake, reduced solute load (urea), direct effects on collecting duct water permeability, and possibly genetic susceptibility via SLCO2A1 variants that enhance collecting duct water reabsorption, which together explain why some patients develop severe hyponatremia even with modest thiazide exposure [^111oUoRs] [^116mPvxH] [^111ZaZtQ].

> I need to check who is most at risk and whether the effect is dose-related. Risk is higher in older adults, women, and those with low body mass; onset can be within days to weeks of initiation, but delayed presentations after months to years are also described; chlorthalidone appears to carry a higher risk than HCTZ at equivalent milligram doses, consistent with its greater potency and duration, and observational emergency department data show a dose-dependent association with hyponatremia and falls, which reinforces clinical vigilance in susceptible populations [^111oUoRs] [^113qo8JG] [^114vGtgW].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards. FDA labeling for HCTZ repeatedly warns about hyponatremia and advises periodic electrolyte monitoring, and major guidelines endorse thiazides as first-line antihypertensives while explicitly recommending electrolyte checks 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change; nephrology guidance further highlights heightened hyponatremia risk in older adults and recommends early lab follow-up after starting thiazides [^111Zh7cW] [^115LbeJ1] [^113Mbx4o] [^114Auq3t].

> Let me consider how to differentiate thiazide-associated hyponatremia from SIADH, because that affects management. Classic urine indices can be misleading in thiazide users due to natriuresis; a two-step approach using serum chloride and potassium balance and, when needed, fractional uric acid excretion can help distinguish volume-depleted TAH from SIADH-like TAH, and in complex cases copeptin or a copeptin-to-urine sodium ratio may assist, though these tools require clinical context and are not perfect discriminators [^115rmtPo] [^115wv372] [^11336w5M].

> I should double-check management principles to ensure they are consistent with evidence. The cornerstone is immediate thiazide discontinuation, correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and fluid restriction tailored to the pathophysiology; in severely symptomatic cases, hypertonic saline is appropriate, but I need to ensure slow correction to avoid osmotic demyelination, and I should remember that thiazide rechallenge commonly reproduces hyponatremia, so documenting this adverse reaction is important to prevent recurrence [^111oUoRs] [^115zTKGG] [^116mPvxH].

> But wait, what if the patient needs ongoing diuretic therapy after thiazide-induced hyponatremia? In that scenario, I should avoid re-exposure to thiazides and consider a loop diuretic if diuresis is still needed, as loops impair urinary concentrating ability and are less likely to cause hyponatremia; this switch strategy is supported by guideline suggestions for patients who develop thiazide-associated hyponatremia, with close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function during the transition [^117JZ2ik] [^112e7zPg].

> In summary, yes — HCTZ can cause hyponatremia, the association is biologically plausible, consistently observed across large observational datasets, and explicitly warned in regulatory labeling and guidelines. Risk is higher in older adults, women, those with low body mass, and with more potent thiazide-like agents such as chlorthalidone, and the clinical course ranges from mild, asymptomatic cases to severe, life-threatening hyponatremia, so proactive monitoring and prompt management are essential [^111oUoRs] [^114CVTvy] [^113Qw3rs] [^111Zh7cW] [^113Mbx4o].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) can cause hyponatremia, especially in older adults, women, and those with low body mass or high water intake [^111oUoRs]. The risk is **dose-related** and rises with higher doses or prolonged use [^114vGtgW]. Hyponatremia usually develops within days to weeks of initiation and can be severe, even life-threatening [^114CVTvy] [^112smTo7]. Management includes stopping HCTZ, restricting fluids, and correcting electrolytes; **monitor sodium within 2–4 weeks of starting or changing the dose** [^113Mbx4o] [^114Auq3t].

---

## Mechanisms of hyponatremia induced by HCTZ

HCTZ-induced hyponatremia is multifactorial, involving **impaired free water excretion**, natriuresis with volume depletion, and increased ADH activity [^111oUoRs] [^116mPvxH].

- **Impaired free water excretion**: HCTZ inhibits the Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal tubule, reducing sodium reabsorption and impairing the kidney's ability to excrete free water, especially with high fluid intake [^111oUoRs] [^111ZaZtQ].

- **Natriuresis and volume depletion**: HCTZ causes sodium loss, which can lead to hypovolemia and non-osmotic ADH release, promoting water retention and hyponatremia [^116mPvxH] [^114NEZkY].

- **Increased ADH activity**: HCTZ may enhance ADH action or release, further impairing water excretion and causing dilutional hyponatremia [^111oUoRs] [^11336w5M].

---

## Risk factors for HCTZ-induced hyponatremia

Several patient and treatment factors increase the risk of **hyponatremia with HCTZ**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults have higher risk due to impaired water excretion and higher ADH levels [^111oUoRs] [^114vGtgW] |
| Sex | Female sex is associated with higher risk, possibly due to hormonal differences [^111oUoRs] [^114vGtgW] |
| Low body mass | Lower BMI increases risk, likely due to smaller total body water and higher sensitivity to sodium shifts [^111oUoRs] |
| High water intake | Excessive fluid intake exacerbates dilutional hyponatremia [^111oUoRs] [^111ZaZtQ] |
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged use increase risk [^114vGtgW] |
| Comorbidities | Heart failure, liver disease, and renal impairment increase risk [^114NEZkY] |

---

## Incidence and severity of hyponatremia associated with HCTZ

The incidence of hyponatremia with HCTZ varies by population and definition, but **overall risk is clinically meaningful**:

- **Incidence**: 1–30% depending on population and criteria; higher in older adults and women [^111oUoRs] [^114vGtgW] [^111CrsJb].

- **Severity**: Can be severe (< 125 mmol/L) and life-threatening, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^111oUoRs] [^112smTo7].

- **Onset**: Usually within days to weeks of initiation, but can occur at any time during therapy [^114CVTvy] [^111oUoRs].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

HCTZ-induced hyponatremia presents with **nonspecific symptoms** that reflect neurologic dysfunction from low sodium:

- **Mild hyponatremia**: Nausea, headache, confusion, fatigue, muscle cramps [^1126nxri].

- **Severe hyponatremia**: Seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death [^111oUoRs] [^113BDRdJ].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and longer hospital stays [^114vGtgW] [^114LMSGV].

---

## Management strategies

Management of HCTZ-induced hyponatremia includes:

- **Discontinuation**: Stop HCTZ immediately [^111oUoRs] [^115zTKGG].

- **Fluid restriction**: Limit free water intake to reduce dilutional hyponatremia [^111oUoRs] [^111duo5q].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Replace sodium and potassium as needed; hypertonic saline for severe symptomatic cases [^111oUoRs] [^116m8pt2].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum sodium frequently during correction to avoid rapid shifts and osmotic demyelination [^111oUoRs] [^113aETX4].

---

## Preventive measures and monitoring recommendations

To **prevent HCTZ-induced hyponatremia**, use the lowest effective dose, avoid thiazides in high-risk patients when possible, and counsel on limiting fluid intake. Routine monitoring of serum sodium is recommended within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose change, with periodic checks thereafter, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^113Mbx4o] [^114Auq3t] [^114vGtgW].

---

## Comparison with other thiazide diuretics

HCTZ and chlorthalidone differ in pharmacokinetics and risk profiles: chlorthalidone has a longer half-life and greater potency and is associated with a **higher risk of hyponatremia** than HCTZ at equivalent doses [^113qo8JG] [^114Z3kxS].

---

HCTZ can cause hyponatremia, particularly in older adults, women, and those with low body mass or high water intake. The risk is **dose-related** and can be severe; management centers on stopping HCTZ, fluid restriction, and electrolyte correction, with routine sodium monitoring to prevent recurrence [^111oUoRs] [^114CVTvy] [^113Mbx4o].

### Thiazide-induced hyponatraemia is associated with increased water intake and impaired urea-mediated water excretion at low plasma antidiuretic hormone and urine aquaporin-2 [^111ZaZtQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is a common, potentially life-threatening, complication of thiazide diuretics. The mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatraemia is incompletely understood. Previous experiments have suggested a direct effect of thiazide diuretics on the plasma membrane expression of aquaporin (AQP)2.

Methods

We examined the effects of a single re-exposure to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50mg on water balance, renal sodium handling and osmoregulation in 15 elderly hypertensive patients with a history of thiazide-induced hyponatraemia and 15 matched hypertensive controls using thiazide diuretics without previous hyponatraemia.

Results

Patients with thiazide-induced hyponatraemia had significantly lower body weight and lower plasma sodium and osmolality at baseline. After HCTZ administration, plasma sodium and osmolality significantly decreased and remained lower in patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). Plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and urine AQP2 were low or suppressed in patients, whereas solute and electrolyte-free water clearance was significantly increased compared with controls. Ad libitum water intake was significantly higher in patients (2543 ± 925ml) than in controls (1828 ± 624ml, P < 0.05), whereas urinary sodium excretion did not differ. In contrast, urea excretion remained significantly lower in patients (263 ± 69mmol per 24h) compared with controls (333 ± 97mmol per 24h, P < 0.05) and predicted the decrease in plasma sodium following HCTZ administration.

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics are associated with markedly impaired free water excretion at low ADH and AQP2 in elderly patients. The higher water intake and lower urea excretion in patients points to an important role for polydipsia and urea-mediated water excretion in the pathogenesis of thiazide-induced hyponatraemia.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among elderly Taiwanese patients [^112JyF2x]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a common chronic disease in the elderly and thiazide diuretics are frequently used as a first-line treatment. Thiazides, a current class of diuretics, competitively antagonize the sodium chloride co-transport protein on the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium chloride and achieve diuresis.

Treatment guidelines often classify hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone as thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics, and these drugs are the most commonly used thiazide diuretics in major clinical trials. National guidelines from the US recommended thiazide diuretics as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, primarily because of their efficacy to reduce cardiovascular complications in major outcome trials such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) and Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). Most recent US, Canadian, and European guidelines also recommend thiazide diuretics as first-line drugs for patients with hypertension. However, in the UK, thiazide-type diuretics are not approved as a first-line treatment for patients with hypertension, and thiazide-like diuretics are recommended instead. Thus, there is a knowledge gap related to the efficacy and side effects of these treatments.

Hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disorder observed in clinical practice, is often difficult to recognize in the early stages, and is a reported side effect of thiazides. Recent research has noted that the incidence of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) has increased, and may even be as high as 30%. Although hyponatremia frequently develops rapidly after initiation of thiazide diuretics, many cases of hyponatremia occur after a few months or years of use of thiazide diuretics. A review found that the mean time to TAH after the initiation of therapy was 19 days, and the mean serum sodium level of patients with hyponatremia was 116 mmol/L. While many cases of hyponatremia are asymptomatic or mild, patients with acute onset can develop seizures or coma, and TAH can result in serious morbidity and even mortality in hospitalized patients.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^117T3NAd]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Tekturna HCT

In the short-term controlled trials of various doses of Tekturna HCT, in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.2%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L) was 0.8%. No patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium.

Aliskiren

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)], NSAIDs, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

HCTZ can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Tekturna HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

5.9 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole

Aliskiren

When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.10 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

HCTZ, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle- closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue HCTZ as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### An elderly patient with chronic hyponatremia [^1173mHch]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder. With the aging of the population and the greater propensity of the elderly to develop hyponatremia, this electrolyte disorder is of increasing importance to the practicing nephrologist. In this Attending Rounds, an illustrative patient with hyponatremia is presented. The reasons for the increased incidence and prevalence of hyponatremia in the elderly are discussed, with emphasis on the effects of aging on urinary dilution, the frequently multifactorial nature of hyponatremia in this population, and the absence of a definite cause for inappropriate and persistent vasopressin release in many such patients. The rationale for treating the hyponatremia, even when apparently asymptomatic, is discussed, with attention to cognitive function, gait, and bone structure disturbances that increase the risk for fractures. The various available treatment approaches, including water restriction, demeclocycline, loop diuretics with NaCl supplementation, urea, and vasopressin antagonists are summarized, with emphasis on the efficacy and limitations of each of these therapies.

### Severe hyponatremia associated with thiazide diuretic use [^112smTo7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used as first-line antihypertensive agents. Hyponatremia is a reported, though uncommon, complication of thiazide use. Although the exact mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is unclear, it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Case Report

We report a 69-year-old man with generalized weakness beginning 2 weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Evaluation revealed a serum sodium level of 120 mmol/L. The patient was admitted and successfully treated with free water restriction and discontinuation of the HCTZ. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Hyponatremia is an uncommon complication of thiazide diuretic use, which frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. Identification of TIH is crucial to prevent its potentially life-threatening complications.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^117D4Ytj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Safety

Figure 3 shows the comparative safety profile for the 2 drugs (eAppendix, eFigure 6, and eTables 9–12 in the Supplement). Chlorthalidone shows a different safety profile compared with hydrochlorothiazide, with the following outcomes different after correction for multiple hypotheses: chlorthalidone was associated with an increased risk for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Chlorthalidone was associated with a decreased risk for diagnosed abnormal weight gain. Hypokalemia had an uncalibrated HR of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.58–3.46) and calibrated HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). The uncalibrated and calibrated HR for hyponatremia was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.20–1.53) and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.16–1.47), respectively; acute renal failure, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.18–1.72) and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.15–1.63), respectively; and abnormal weight gain, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60–0.87) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61–0.86), respectively. The following findings had CIs that excluded 1 but did not surpass the Bonferroni threshold: chlorthalidone was associated with an increased risk of hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, vomiting, syncope, gout, impotence, and anaphylactoid reaction and associated with a decreased risk of anemia, depression, dementia, and anxiety.

Figure 3.
Forest Plot of Safety and Effectiveness Outcomes

Forest plot of hazard ratio estimates and calibrated 95% CIs for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for 55 safety and effectiveness outcomes. The safety signals predominantly favored hydrochlorothiazide.

Furthermore, the event rates for hypokalemia were substantial. In CCAE, the rates per patient were 6.3% and 1.9% for chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves (eAppendix and eFigure 7 in the Supplement) were consistent with our assumption of proportionality for our use of the Cox proportional hazards model.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the all of Us research program [^115dxDU3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome definition

For all of the survival analyses in this study, we defined outcome events as the first presence of decreased plasma sodium (≤ 134 mEq/L), adjusted using the highest glucose reading of the same day with Katz's formula: Measured sodium + 0.016 × (Serum glucose − 100). We also accepted diagnostic codes for hyponatremia/hypoosmolality (ICD‐9‐CM 276.1 and ICD‐10‐CM E87.1) or diagnostic codes for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ICD‐10‐CM E22.2) as outcome events. Individuals who did not experience the events were right censored at the date of last plasma sodium laboratory measurement. In this study, the relative percentages of participants meeting event criteria (using 134 mEq/L as cut‐off) were 92% by laboratory result only, compared to 5% by diagnostic code only, and 3% by both on the same day.

We reported the cumulative incidence of outcome events within the first 30 days (early events) and within the first 3 years.

Polypharmacy and comorbidity

As a secondary analysis, we studied the role of polypharmacy and comorbidity by examining the influence of several other classes of medications and coexisting medical conditions as covariates. Concomitant medication classes included as covariates were drugs that can alter hemodynamics (antihypertensives) or electrolyte homeostasis (diuretics), because these factors can influence the secretion of ADH from the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary. We included β‐ or αβ‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and two common diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide), as well as atypical antipsychotics. Relevant comorbidities included as covariates were congestive heart failure (CHF), which can directly cause SIADH, and diabetes mellitus, which can cause a constellation of electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, as well as an osmotic laboratory‐based artifact.(For full lists of medications explored, please see Supplementary Method S3) Due to the chronic nature of these two comorbidities, we extended the period for capturing these covariates to "ever had" in an effort to minimize the impact of the false negatives in our secondary analyses.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Associations between antihypertensive medications and severe hyponatremia: a Swedish population-based case-control study [^114WweSA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In hospitalized patients, electrolyte disturbances are frequent, with up to 30% being affected by hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can be a life-threatening condition with seizures, coma, and death (due to brain edema) but more often displays mild, nonspecific symptoms (eg, lethargy, gait abnormality, confusion). One of the most frequent causes of hyponatremia is drugs, primarily thiazide diuretics, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and antipsychotics, but many other drugs can also induce hyponatremia.

The 5 major drug classes in hypertension treatment are calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-receptor blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and thiazide diuretics. These drugs are used by a large proportion of the population, since the prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% to 45% in the adults and more than 60% in individuals 60 years old or older. Thiazide diuretics are well-known to induce hyponatremia, but whether hyponatremia can be induced by the other 4 major drug classes is more controversial. Mostly case reports or smaller observational studies have described hyponatremia induced by CCBs, BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs. Due to the considerable prescription of these drugs, even a rare adverse reaction may have considerable clinical implications. Thus, the evidence of an association between antihypertensives and hyponatremia remains insufficient, and this may cause issues for the treating physician and the patient.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between treatment with CCBs, BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate newly initiated versus ongoing use of these medications to investigate any time-dependent effects.

Outcomes

The outcomes of interest were adverse kidney events (ie, ≥ 30% eGFR decline, dialysis, or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular events (composite of acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation), all-cause mortality, and electrolyte disturbances (ie, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For eGFR decline of 30% or more, a follow-up eGFR value was required; indexed participants without a follow-up eGFR value were excluded from this analysis. eGFR decline was defined using an eGFR from any time from more than 90 days to 3 years after the index date. Electrolyte disturbances were defined as hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1]), hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L), and hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 130 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1]). Recurrent outcomes were not considered. Death was a competing event for kidney, cardiovascular, and electrolyte outcomes. Crossover between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide use, emigration from Ontario, and conclusion of the study period were censoring events for all outcomes. Patients were followed-up until the earliest date among the specified outcome occurrence, emigration from Ontario, death, or the end of the study period (maximum 3 years).

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Risk of thiazide-induced hyponatremia in patients with hypertension [^111CrsJb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although hyponatremia is a well-recognized complication of treatment with thiazide diuretics, the risk of thiazide-induced hyponatremia remains uncertain in routine care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a multicenter clinical research registry to identify 2613 adult outpatients that were newly treated for hypertension between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 at 2 teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and followed them for up to 10 years.

Results

Two hundred twenty patients exposed to ongoing thiazide therapy were compared with 2393 patients who were not exposed. In the exposed group, 66 (30%) developed hyponatremia (sodium ≤ 130 mmol/L). The adjusted incidence rate of hyponatremia was 140 cases per 1000 person-years for patients treated with thiazides, compared with 87 cases per 1000 person-years in those without thiazides. Patients exposed to thiazides were more likely to develop hyponatremia (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.25). There was no significant difference in the risk of hospitalizations associated with hyponatremia (adjusted rate ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.46–2.32) or mortality (adjusted rate ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.12–1.42). The number needed to harm (to result in one excess case of incident hyponatremia in 5 years) was 15.02 (95% CI, 7.88–160.30).

Conclusions

Approximately 3 in 10 patients exposed to thiazides who continue to take them develop hyponatremia.

### Combining loop and thiazide diuretics Across the left ventricular ejection fraction spectrum: the CLOROTIC trial [^111UaZXm]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to furosemide in the CLOROTIC (Combining Loop with Thiazide Diuretics for Decompensated Heart Failure) trial improved the diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).

Objectives

This work aimed to evaluate if these results differ across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Methods

This post hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CLOROTIC trial enrolled 230 patients with AHF to receive either HCTZ or a placebo in addition to an intravenous furosemide regimen. The influence of LVEF on primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated.

Results

The median LVEF was 55%: 166 (72%) patients had LVEF > 40%, and 64 (28%) had LVEF ≤ 40%. Patients with a lower LVEF were younger, more likely to be male, had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease, and had higher natriuretic peptide levels. The addition of HCTZ to furosemide was associated with the greatest weight loss at 72 of 96 hours, better metrics of diuretic response, and greater 24-hour diuresis compared with placebo, with no significant differences according to the LVEF category (using 2 LVEF cutoff points: 40% and 50%) or LVEF as a continuous variable (all P values were insignificant). There were no significant differences observed with the addition of HCTZ in terms of mortality, rehospitalizations, or safety endpoints (impaired renal function, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia) among the 2 LVEF groups (all P values were insignificant).

Conclusions

Adding HCTZ to intravenous furosemide seems to be effective strategy for improving diuretic response in AHF without treatment effect modification according to baseline LVEF.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Amlodipine valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT) [^113hQ7S3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Exforge HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Exforge HCT [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of Exforge HCT in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the Exforge HCT and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with Exforge HCT compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Exforge HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

### Cumulative incidence of thiazide-induced hyponatremia: a population-based cohort study [^114CVTvy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

According to drug labels, the frequency of thiazide-induced hyponatremia is unknown or uncommon to very rare (that is, < 1 in 10000 to < 1 in 100), but the exact burden remains unclear.

Objective

To estimate the increase in the cumulative incidence of hyponatremia using thiazide diuretics compared with nonthiazide antihypertensive drugs in routine clinical practice.

Design

Population and register-based cohort study using target trial emulation.

Setting

Denmark, 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2018.

Participants

Two target trials were emulated among persons aged 40 years or older who had no recent prescription for any antihypertensive drug, had no previous hyponatremia, and were eligible for the studied antihypertensive treatments. The first target trial emulation compared new use of bendroflumethiazide (BFZ) versus a calcium-channel blocker (CCB). The second target trial emulation compared new use of hydrochlorothiazide plus a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (HCTZ-RASi; that is, combination pill) versus a RASi alone.

Measurements

Two-year cumulative incidences of sodium levels less than 130 mmol/L using stabilized inverse probability of treatment-weighted survival curves.

Results

The study compared 37786 new users of BFZ with 44963 of a CCB and 11943 new users of HCTZ-RASi with 85784 of a RASi. The 2-year cumulative incidences of hyponatremia were 3.83% for BFZ and 3.51% for HCTZ-RASi. The risk differences were 1.35% (95% CI, 1.04% to 1.66%) between BFZ and CCB and 1.38% (CI, 1.01% to 1.75%) between HCTZ-RASi and RASi; risk differences were higher with older age and higher comorbidity burden. The respective hazard ratios were 3.56 (CI, 2.76 to 4.60) and 4.25 (CI, 3.23 to 5.59) during the first 30 days since treatment initiation and 1.26 (CI, 1.09 to 1.46) and 1.29 (CI, 1.05 to 1.58) after 1 year.

Limitation

The study assumed that filled prescriptions equaled drug use, and residual confounding is likely.

Conclusion

Treatment initiation with thiazide diuretics suggests a more substantial excess risk for hyponatremia, particularly during the first months of treatment, than indicated by drug labeling.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) [^113B5SNN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Amiloride hydrochloride [^112R9hen]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Electrolyte Imbalance and BUN Increases

Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may occur when amiloride HCl is used with other diuretics and increases in BUN levels have been reported. These increases usually have accompanied vigorous fluid elimination, especially when diuretic therapy was used in seriously ill patients, such as those who had hepatic cirrhosis with ascites and metabolic alkalosis, or those with resistant edema. Therefore, when amiloride HCl is given with other diuretics to such patients, careful monitoring of serum electrolytes and BUN levels is important. In patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy, manifested by tremors, confusion, and coma, and increased jaundice, have been reported in association with diuretics, including amiloride HCl.

Drug Interactions

When amiloride HCl is administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. (See WARNINGS).

Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.

In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when amiloride HCl and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Since indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics, including amiloride HCl, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility

There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when amiloride HCl was administered for 92 weeks to mice at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (25 times the maximum daily human dose). Amiloride HCl has also been administered for 104 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 6 and 8 mg/kg/day (15 and 20 times the maximum daily dose for humans, respectively) and showed no evidence of carcinogenicity.

Amiloride HCl was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium with or without a mammalian liver microsomal activation system (Ames test).

### Hyponatremia in acute decompensated heart failure: depletion versus dilution [^114NEZkY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia frequently poses a therapeutic challenge in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Treating physicians should differentiate between depletional versus dilutional hyponatremia. The former is caused by diuretic agents, which enhance sodium excretion, often with concomitant potassium/magnesium losses. This can be treated with isotonic saline, whereas potassium/magnesium administration may be helpful if plasma concentrations are low. In contrast, as impaired water excretion, rather than sodium deficiency, is the culprit in dilutional hyponatremia, isotonic saline administration may further depress the serum sodium concentration. Because free water excretion is achieved by continuous sodium reabsorption in distal nephron segments with low water permeability, diuretic agents that impair this mechanism (e.g., thiazide-type diuretic agents and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) should be avoided, and proximally acting agents (e.g., acetazolamide and loop diuretic agents) are preferred. Vasopressin antagonists, which promote low water permeability in the collecting ducts and, hence, free water excretion, remain under investigation for dilutional hyponatremia in ADHF.

Two-step approach with first blood assessment and second urine assessment for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia. Abbreviations: Cl −, chloride; FUA, fractional uric acid excretion; K +, potassium; Na +, sodium. *in case of urine sodium < 20 mmol/L and urine osmolality < 200 mOsm/kg see guidelines.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, it was a retrospective, exploratory analysis based on chart reviews so that a prospective validation based on power analysis is needed. Further studies should especially validate our cutoff for ChU in the two-step approach, as the number of patients was modest. Yet, we collected data prospectively for assessment of hyponatremia diagnosis and treatment, and assessment of the treatment response was prospectively defined. Secondly, most of the patients had volume-depleted TAH, in contrast to literature data showing a higher rate of SIAD-like TAH. However, this might be due to the fact that our treatment response was based on the initial treatment response, and that SIAD-like TAH might have developed later on.

Despite these limitations, our study suggests new tools and a pragmatic two-step approach in the differential diagnosis of profound TAH, proposing sodium-independent urine indices. Further studies are needed to validate the two-step approach and the present results.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^1159kEcm]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The main aim of our analysis is to compare the influence of HCTZ and CTLD on systolic and diastolic BP and on the levels of serum sodium and serum potassium in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and to reinterpret evidence of interchangeability of HCTZ and CTLD.

Data sources and search strategy

We searched for evidence in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, PsyInfo, eLIBRARY.ru, as well as registries for data of clinical trials (and) (1975–2017/Dec) using the following keywords: hydrochlorothiazide, chlortalidone, diuretics, hypertension, blood pressure, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, potassium, sodium, clinical trial, controlled, randomi*, double blind. The following search strategy was applied: diuretics AND hydrochlorothiazide OR chlorthalidone AND blood pressure OR hypertension AND hypokalemia OR potassium AND hyponatremia OR sodium AND clinical trial AND controlled AND randomized OR observational OR double blind. We searched for full-text articles and abstracts published in Latin (English) and Cyrillic. Results in Cyrillic were not found.

Inclusion criteria

Randomized controlled studies and observational studies investigating different doses of CTLD and HCTZ;
CTLD and HCTZ alone or in combination with other antihypertensive regimen;
Determination of changes in systolic and/or diastolic BP and/or determination of changes in the serum levels of Na+ and/or K+;
Type of participants: patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

Quality assessment

Effective Public Health Practice Project was utilized to assess study quality. This tool includes assessment of different characteristics like selection bias, study design, blinding, data collection method, confounders, and dropouts in order to help raters form an opinion of quality based upon information contained in the study. Mixed methods studies can be quality assessed using this tool with the quantitative component of the study. Two of the seven studies which we included in our statistical analysis: retrospective observational cohort analysis, retrospective analysis were deemed to be of weak quality due to their minimum scores regarding questions of randomization and blinding. Table S1 for quality assessment of the included in the meta-analysis studies is presented in the Supplementary material file.

### Sequential drug-induced severe hyponatremia in a minimally symptomatic, 81-year-old patient [^116VuEPW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been previous cases of medication-induced hyponatremia with various causative agents reported. Severe hyponatremia, a common medical emergency, can vary widely in its presentation, ranging from seizures and comas to no clinical manifestations.

Case Report

An 81-year-old female patient presented to the Emergency Department with history of a fall. She had a known case of hypertension and was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide. When evaluated at the hospital, her sodium level was measured as 106 mmol/L and her clinical symptoms were unremarkable. She was simultaneously diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, for which she was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. A few hours after administration, her sodium level fell even further, and she quickly developed symptoms of hyponatremia. After discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and treatment with hypertonic saline (3% NS), she improved and made a full recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We present an unusual case of minimally symptomatic, severe consecutive multi-medication-induced hyponatremia. As hyponatremia can present asymptomatically, routinely checking sodium levels is recommended, especially when caring for patients who recently experienced a fall or started a thiazide diuretic.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^116ciKVY]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Many guidelines recommend CTLD and HCTZ as a first-line therapy for mild to moderate essential hypertension. However, HCTZ seems to be the more commonly used diuretic. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated a slight superiority for CTLD regarding BP control. At the same time, the two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile although data concerning their effect on serum potassium and sodium is scarce. Additional studies investigating rates of hypokalemia and hyponatremia should be performed. Based on our results we think CTLD should be widely used as an alternative to HCTZ in clinical practice.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115LjBfE]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A simple difference in effective dose, with chlorthalidone known to have a greater-per-milligram potency for lowering blood pressure levels than hydrochlorothiazide, could underlie some of the observed differences in toxicities, but our dose-sensitivity analysis still revealed higher hypokalemia for chlorthalidone at a 1:2 chlorthalidone:hydrochlorothiazide dose ratio. Furthermore, if clinicians treat to similar blood pressure levels, then they may titrate the doses to levels with similar blood pressure reduction, explaining our lack of differences in effectiveness but not our differences in safety. Ernst et alfound better chlorthalidone nighttime blood pressure control at a 1:2 dose ratio, which could explain some increased safety signals.

The literature inconsistently points to a difference in hypokalemia between the 2 drugs. At a 1:2 dose ratio, Ernst et alfound little difference in potassium. At a 1:1 dose ratio, Bakris et alfound no statistically significant difference in the hypokalemia rate although with only 5 events, the study lacked power. The network meta-analysis by Ernst et alfound a small difference in potassium reduction. Two analyses of the MRFIT cohort, showed increased reduction of potassium for chlorthalidone when both drugs were used at high doses (50 mg-100 mg). A study of real-world evidence by Dhalla et alshowed odds ratios around 3 for hypokalemia, matching our results well, even in the 2 strata in which chlorthalidone was half the dose of hydrochlorothiazide; it also found an HR of 1.68 for hyponatremia.

Limitations

Our main limitation is the possibility of residual confounding including confounding by indication, differences in physician characteristics that may be associated with drug choice, concomitant use of other drugs started after the index date, differences in blood pressure measurement error, and informative censoring at the end of the on-treatment periods. To minimize this risk, we used newer methods to account for bias and to detect residual bias through our negative and positive controls.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114t8uvZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher rate of electrolyte and renal disorders, with an increase in hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. Based on the electrolyte findings, chlorthalidone's association with an increase in rate of type II diabetes may be associated with potassium depletion or to dehydration. Chlorthalidone's lower rate of abnormal weight gain may be associated with more effective diuresis.

To our knowledge, there have been no completed large head-to-head randomized clinical trials comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on cardiovascular effectiveness. An indirect meta-analysis by Thomopoulos et allooked at cardiovascular outcomes vs placebo for low-dose diuretics; there were nominal differences, but the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelineinterpreted the results as roughly equivalent for the 2 drugs. The indirect meta-analysis by Roush et alshowed an improved relative risk for composite cardiovascular events for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.88). The real-world evidence study by Dhalla et alestimated an HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81–1.06), although 1 dose subgroup did reach statistical significance without adjustment for multiple hypotheses. An observational study of the MRFIT cohort by Dorsch et alshowed a relative HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68–0.92), but the doses for both drugs were high. A randomized clinical trial comparing hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone currently in progressmay provide more definitive information to inform drug choice.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among elderly Taiwanese patients [^114LMSGV]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Other side effects of thiazide diuretics include hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperglycemia, which are commonly seen in the clinic. The use of thiazide diuretics has also been associated with significantly higher risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), particularly stroke, in patients with type 2 diabetes who received intensive blood pressure control.

The risk factors for TAH include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass; elderly patients may also represent a high-risk group for the occurrence of hyponatremia. Since age is a strongly associated risk factor for hyponatremia, the decision to initiate thiazide diuretics for elderly patients should be made with caution.

Hyponatremia induced by thiazide diuretics is an important topic in the treatment of hypertension; however, the relationship between thiazide complications and subsequent hypertension treatment goals are rarely explored. The goal of aggressive treatment of hypertension is to reduce the risk of MACE and to ultimately reduce mortality; however, hyponatremia increases the duration of hospital stay and is associated with a higher risk of death in hospitalized patients. Hence, there seems a lack of knowledge on the relationships between TAH and MACE in elderly patients.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether TAH adversely influences the risk of MACE in the elderly in Taiwan. We aimed to fill in this knowledge gap and provide a statistic analysis of the risk of MACE associated with use of thiazide diuretics in the elderly population.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to risk of osmotic demyelination, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome depends on the following factors:

- biochemical degree and duration of hyponatremia at presentation

- speed of increase in serum sodium concentration

- history of alcohol abuse and/or liver disease

- use of thiazide or antidepressant medications.

### A randomized trial of distal diuretics versus dietary sodium restriction for hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^1162sKYA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal diuretics are considered less effective than loop diuretics in CKD. However, data to support this perception are limited.

Methods

To investigate whether distal diuretics are noninferior to dietary sodium restriction in reducing BP in patients with CKD stage G3 or G4 and hypertension, we conducted a 6-week, randomized, open-label crossover trial comparing amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide (5 mg/50 mg daily) with dietary sodium restriction (60 mmol per day). Antihypertension medication was discontinued for a 2-week period before randomization. We analyzed effects on BP, kidney function, and fluid balance and related this to renal clearance of diuretics.

Results

A total of 26 patients (with a mean eGFR of 39 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) completed both treatments. Dietary sodium restriction reduced sodium excretion from 160 to 64 mmol per day. Diuretics produced a greater reduction in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP; from 138 to 124 mm Hg) compared with sodium restriction (from 134 to 129 mm Hg), as well as a significantly greater effect on extracellular water, eGFR, plasma renin, and aldosterone. Both interventions resulted in a similar decrease in body weight and NT-proBNP. Neither approaches decreased albuminuria significantly, whereas diuretics did significantly reduce urinary angiotensinogen and β 2-microglobulin excretion. Although lower eGFR and higher plasma indoxyl sulfate correlated with lower diuretic clearance, the diuretic effects on body weight and BP at lower eGFR were maintained. During diuretic treatment, higher PGE2 excretion correlated with lower free water clearance, and four patients developed mild hyponatremia.

Conclusions

Distal diuretics are noninferior to dietary sodium restriction in reducing BP and extracellular volume in CKD. Diuretic sensitivity in CKD is maintained despite lower diuretic clearance.

### Evolution and evolving resolution of controversy over existence and prevalence of cerebral / renal salt wasting [^115agtqa]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The topic of hyponatremia is in a state of flux. We review a new approach to diagnosis that is superior to previous methods. It simplifies identifying the causes of hyponatremia, the most important issue being the differentiation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) from cerebral/renal salt wasting (RSW). We also report on the high prevalence of RSW without cerebral disease in the general wards of the hospital.

Recent Findings

We applied our new approach to hyponatremia by utilizing sound pathophysiologic criteria in 62 hyponatremic patients. Seventeen (27%) had SIADH, 19 (31%) had a reset osmostat, 24 (38%) had RSW with 21 having no evidence of cerebral disease, 1 had Addison's disease, and 1 was because of hydrochlorothiazide. Many had urine sodium concentrations (UNa) less than 30mmol/l.

Summary

RSW is much more common than perceived in the general wards of the hospital. It is important to change the terminology from cerebral to RSW and to differentiate SIADH from RSW. These changes will improve clinical outcomes because of divergent therapeutic goals of water-restricting in SIADH and administering salt and water to a dehydrated patient with RSW. The present review will hopefully spur others to reflect and act on the new findings and different approaches to hyponatremia.

### Associations between antihypertensive medications and severe hyponatremia: a Swedish population-based case-control study [^114J3L9k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The antihypertensive effect of CCBs is mediated through peripheral vasodilation. However, CCBs also have natriuretic properties, possibly through direct effects on renal proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. The result suggests that the increased risk is restricted to vascular CCBs. However, for cardiac CCBs, the analysis was based on only 25 individuals resulting in a wide confidence interval, weakening the conclusion in this regard, and a class effect for all CCBs cannot be ruled out.

Occasional studies have linked BBs with severe hyponatremia, mainly atenolol but also bisoprolol and propranolol. We found that propranolol and atenolol were associated with an increased risk of severe hyponatremia regardless of treatment duration, while the other BBs only correlated with hyponatremia when newly initiated. The potential mechanism of action is unclear, but BBs indirectly inhibit angiotensin II via inhibition of renin secretion; this, in turn, may lead to hyponatremia (see the following discussion about ARBs).

There are several reports about ACEI-induced severe hyponatremia. In the majority of cases enalapril is the culprit, but lisinopril, ramipril, and other ACEIs have also been implicated. The mechanism by which ACEIs may induce severe hyponatremia is unclear. SIADH, has been the suggested as a plausible mechanism, but it may be multifactorial. In low to moderate doses, ACEIs may inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II peripherally but not centrally in the brain. Elevated concentrations of angiotensin I centrally are converted to angiotensin II, which stimulates thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion. Animal studies have shown a markedly increased AVP secretion after intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II, supporting this mechanism.

ARBs were developed as a more specific drug blocking the angiotensin II receptor. ARBs have been associated with severe hyponatremia in some cases. It has been speculated that blocking the angiotensin I receptor leads to an angiotensin II–mediated decrease in renal tubular sodium reabsorption resulting in hyponatremia. However, most cases of ARB-induced severe hyponatremia seemed to have occurred in patients on ARBs in combination with a thiazide diuretic. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, SIADH secondary to brain angiotensin II has been suggested as a plausible mechanism leading to hyponatremia (see previous discussion). However, nonosmotic AVP release caused by hemodynamic effects from antihypertensive treatment, regardless of drug class, is perhaps a more likely explanation considering the uniform effects observed here.

### Use trends of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide among United States adults with hypertension: national health and nutrition examination survey 2009–2018 [^113AJ97p]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the national prevalence of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide use among adults diagnosed with hypertension by sociodemographic subgroup, healthcare access status, and clinical factors.

Methods

Data was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2009–2010 through 2017–2018 survey waves. Patients at least 20years old, diagnosed with hypertension, and on hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone were included. Uni-variable logistic regression models estimated the odds of being on chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide use by sociodemographic and clinical factors. Analyses were adjusted for multi-stage complex survey design and are nationally representative.

Results

Two thousand five hundred and eighty-five participants were included with 95.2% participants using hydrochlorothiazide and 4.8% using chlorthalidone. Participants over 65years were more likely to be on chlorthalidone compared with younger counterparts [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–2.88]. Participants with hypokalemia (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.56–4.42) or hyponatremia [OR 2.298; 95% CI 1.23–4.30) were more likely to be using chlorthalidone compared with patients with normal levels.

Conclusion

Chlorthalidone, a potent and effective first-line antihypertensive agent and thoroughly studied thiazide diuretic with substantial cardiovascular benefits, continues to be underutilized in patients with hypertension. Findings demonstrated that individuals receiving chlorthalidone were more likely to be 65years or older and to experience hyponatremia or hypokalemia. Sociodemographic factors, healthcare access and use, clinical factors, and medical conditions did not appear to sway the choice in thiazide diuretic use.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^116xthhw]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^111TL3KE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Other disadvantages of diuretics

Diuretics may induce some metabolic alterations that are harmful. The most common metabolic derangement is hyponatremia, which appears to be particularly common in elderly women. This side effect can be prevented by use of a low to medium dose of diuretics and by instructing patients to limit fluid intake. The deleterious effects of thiazide on lipid profile are mainly observed in the short term and almost disappear in long-term studies.

Role of diuretics as an add-on therapy

Recently, two large prospective studies cast doubt on the role of thiazides as an add-on therapy. The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) compared the β-blocker atenolol with the calcium antagonist amlodipine. A thiazide was added to atenolol and an ACE inhibitor was added to amlodipine when BP did not reach the goal. The primary end points were not significantly different between the two regimens, but fewer individuals on the amlodipine-based regimen had fatal and nonfatal stroke, total CV events and procedures, and all-cause mortality. From this study, we can only learn that atenolol is less effective than amlodipine, but we cannot blame the diuretic in the worse outcome. The ACCOMPLISH trial was stopped early when the data were clear that the single pill combination of ACE inhibitor with calcium antagonist was superior to the combination of ACE inhibitor with a diuretic. The amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide components of the single pill combination could be titrated to 25 and 10 mg, respectively. Although the dose of amlodipine in the trial was similar to that demonstrating favorable outcomes in other outcome trials, the dose range for hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25 mg) was lower than the dose range (equivalent to 25–50 mg) used in trials demonstrating benefits of thiazide on CV outcome. Information on supplemented antihypertensive agents was not reported, but the recommended supplementary drugs were α- and β-blockers, for which effects on CV outcomes are inferior. Of note, a small but significant BP difference (0.9 mmHg systolic and 1.1 mmHg diastolic; P < 0.001 for both) was recorded between the two arms of treatment favoring the ACE inhibitor–calcium antagonist combination. The right conclusion of the ACCOMPLISH study is that hydrochlorothiazide in a dose of ≤ 25 mg/day may be less effective in preventing CV disease than a full dose of amlodipine.

### Developing prediction models for electrolyte abnormalities in patients indicated for antihypertensive therapy: evidence-based treatment and monitoring recommendations [^117KhcAc]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Various classes of antihypertensive medications are used for blood pressure management, with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers being the most commonly recommended options. Our risk prediction models provide individualized estimates of the risk of developing hyperkalaemia and hyponatraemia, adverse events which are commonly associated with specific antihypertensive drug classes. These models could therefore be useful in clinical decision making regarding which antihypertensive medication class to prescribe. For example, for patients at a high risk of hyperkalaemia but low-average risk of hyponatremia initiating or switching to a thiazide-type diuretic rather than ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers is recommended. Moreover, clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension often recommend combination therapy where monotherapy and lifestyle modifications fail to achieve adequate blood pressure control. In such cases, to reduce potential harm, prescribing combination therapy, such as adding loop diuretics to current prescription in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (avoiding RAAS medications) may also be effective.

Current clinical guidelines recommend monitoring serum electrolytes 1–2 weeks after initiating an RAAS medication, after each increase in dose, and regularly throughout treatment. Similarly, it is advised to measure serum electrolytes before starting a thiazide-type diuretics treatment and regular throughout treatment. In our study, over 44 and 24% of patients with a high risk of CVD also had a high risk of hyponatraemia or hyperkalaemia, respectively. Nearly 40% of patients were not at a high risk of CVD or electrolyte abnormalities. The present clinical prediction models could help target closer monitoring of serum electrolytes for individuals at a higher risk of electrolyte abnormalities after initiating treatment, where resources are limited.

### SIADH and hyponatremia with theophylline [^112cDBy5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of possible theophylline-induced hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Case Summary

An 88-year-old man developed severe symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium 112 mEq/L) associated with inappropriate natriuresis (urinary sodium 58 mEq/L) temporally related to the initiation of theophylline. The patient fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of SIADH after all other causes of hyponatremia were excluded. Furthermore, no other drugs or conditions that could have evoked SIADH were found.

Discussion

Theophylline has rarely been associated with hyponatremia. A thiazide-like action of the drug on the stimulation of SIADH could be the underlying mechanism for SIADH.

Conclusions

Theophylline should be considered as a possible cause of hyponatremia.

### Desmopressin acetate (Ddavp) [^1157Po8Y]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hyponatremia

DDAVP Injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning].

DDAVP Injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), with excessive fluid intake (e.g., polydipsia), using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia.

Prior to starting or resuming DDAVP Injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of DDAVP Injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia.

Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating DDAVP Injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia.

Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e., cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Contraindications (4)].

If hyponatremia occurs, DDAVP Injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia.

5.2	Hypotension and Hypertension

DDAVP may cause hypotension (with compensatory increase in heart rate) or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during DDAVP administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.2)]

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^115HnEwD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The oral LD50of spironolactone is greater than 1000 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits. The oral LD50of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in both mice and rats.

Acute overdosage of spironolactone may be manifested by drowsiness, mental confusion, maculopapular or erythematous rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or diarrhea. Rarely, instances of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (less commonly seen with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide because the hydrochlorothiazide component tends to produce hypokalemia), or hepatic coma may occur in patients with severe liver disease, but these are unlikely due to acute overdosage.

However, because spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contain both spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide, the toxic effects may be intensified, and signs of thiazide overdosage may be present. These include electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia and/or hyponatremia. The potassium-sparing action of spironolactone may predominate and hyperkalemia may occur, especially in patients with impaired renal function. BUN determinations have been reported to rise transiently with hydrochlorothiazide. There may be CNS depression with lethargy or even coma.

Treatment

Induce vomiting or evacuate the stomach by lavage. There is no specific antidote. Treatment is supportive to maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions.

Patients who have renal impairment may develop spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia. In such cases, spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued immediately. With severe hyperkalemia, the clinical situation dictates the procedures to be employed. These include the intravenous administration of calcium chloride solution, sodium bicarbonate solution, and/or the oral or parenteral administration of glucose with a rapid-acting insulin preparation. These are temporary measures to be repeated as required. Cationic exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be orally or rectally administered. Persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis.

### Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide (Benicar hct) [^116yqskV]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin
combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired
effect with monotherapy.

Replacement Therapy

BENICAR HCT(olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide) may be substituted for its titrated
components.

Dose Titration by Clinical Effect

BENICAR HCTis
available in strengths of 20 mg/12.5 mg, 40 mg/12.5 mg and 40 mg/25 mg. A
patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled by BENICAR®or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to once daily
BENICAR HCT(olmesartan
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide).

Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response,
the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2–4 weeks.

If blood pressure is not controlled by BENICAR®alone,
hydrochlorothiazide may be added starting with a dose of 12.5 mg and later
titrated to 25 mg once daily.

If a patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide, BENICAR®may be added starting with a dose of 20 mg once daily and titrated to 40 mg, for
inadequate blood pressure control. If large doses of hydrochlorothiazide have
been used as monotherapy and volume depletion or hyponatremia is present,
caution should be used when adding BENICAR®or switching
to BENICAR HCTas marked
decreases in blood pressure may occur (see WARNINGS, Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted
Patients). Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of
hydrochlorothiazide to 12.5 mg before adding BENICAR®.
The antihypertensive effect of BENICAR HCTis related to the dose of both components over the
range of 10 mg/12.5 mg to 40 mg/25 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). The dose
of BENICAR HCTis one tablet
once daily. More than one tablet daily is not recommended.

BENICAR HCTmay be
administered with other antihypertensive agents.

Patients with Renal Impairment

The usual regimens of therapy with BENICAR HCTmay be followed provided the
patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min. In patients with more severe
renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so BENICAR HCTis not recommended.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary with hepatic impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations).

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solute load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient. The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) [^115LbeJ1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because lisinopril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with lisinopril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

### Risk of electrolyte disorders, syncope, and falls in patients taking thiazide diuretics: results of a cross-sectional study [^114vGtgW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are a mainstay in the management of hypertension and often associated with dyselectrolytemias. We investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for hyponatremia and hypokalemia in thiazide users, substance-specific differences, and the association of thiazides with syncope and falls.

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis all patients admitted to an interdisciplinary emergency department in Switzerland between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, with measurements of serum sodium and potassium were included. Data regarding serum electrolytes and creatinine were analyzed to classify for dysnatremias, dyskalemias, and acute kidney injury. Chart reviews were performed to screen for syncope or falls.

Results

A total of 1604 patients (7.9%) took thiazides. Acute kidney injury was significantly more common in thiazide users (22.1 vs 7%, P < .0001). Hyponatremia (22.1 vs 9.8%, P < .0001) and hypokalemia (19 vs 11%, P < .0001) were more frequent with thiazides. Thiazide use together with higher age and female sex were independent predictors of hyponatremia and hypokalemia. A dose-dependent effect was found for electrolyte disorders, and there was a variance in risk between the investigated substances with chlorthalidone bearing the highest and hydrochlorothiazide the lowest risk. Patients taking thiazide diuretics had significantly more episodes of syncope and falls.

Conclusions

Thiazide use is a clear risk factor for hyponatremia and hypokalemia. The effect appears to be dose-dependent and highly variable depending on the substance. Syncope and falls seem to be causally related to thiazide use. Especially in patients who are elderly, female, and prone to falls, the use of thiazide diuretics should be thoroughly questioned.

### Combination of loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics in heart failure [^115vRMwt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Volume overload is an important clinical target in heart failure management, typically addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via "sequential nephron blockade", first described more than 40 years ago. Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish safety and clinical efficacy. We summarize the existing literature evaluating the combination of loop and thiazide diuretics in patients with heart failure in order to describe the possible benefits and hazards associated with this therapy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema resolution, at the risk of inducing severe hypokalemia in addition to hyponatremia, hypotension, and worsening renal function. We provide considerations about prudent use of this therapy and review potential misconceptions about this long-used diuretic approach. Finally, we seek to highlight the need for pragmatic clinical trials for this commonly used therapy.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^1161X3KU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are a mainstay of therapy for a wide variety of diseases ranging from hypertension to the nephrotic syndrome. Despite this key role, the various substances used as diuretics can have serious side effects, such as volume depletion, ototoxicity as with loop diuretics, and, of course, the induction of electrolyte disorders. In an ageing population, the number of patients treated with diuretics for different indications is increasing, as is the relevance of their side effects.

Studies investigating diuretic therapy-induced electrolyte disorders have mainly focused on the effects of thiazide diuretics. In a randomized controlled trial in hypertensive patients, serum potassium levels were significantly lower in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. However, only patients who did not receive potassium supplements developed marked hypokalemia with potassium levels below 3.0 mmol/L. A more recent study on hypertensive patients found an incidence of 30% for hyponatremia in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. The same study did not find an increased risk of hospitalization or death in patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia.

To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of diuretic use and associated electrolyte disorders have never been investigated in a large group of patients presenting to a hospital emergency room (ER). Findings from large patient series on the impact of non-thiazide diuretics on electrolyte levels are especially lacking.

Therefore, we investigated the associations between diuretics being taken and the prevalence of electrolyte disorders as well as the impact of electrolyte disorders on patient outcome.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^115rmtPo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing thiazide or thiazide-like treatment are at risk for hyponatremia, with a reported incidence of hyponatremia up to 30% in hospitalized patients. Patients with thiazide- or thiazide-like-associated hyponatremia (TAH) can either present with a diuretic-induced volume depletion and consequent hypovolemic hyponatremia, or with a picture of euvolemic hyponatremia mimicking a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), in which case it is referred to as SIAD-like TAH.

The European Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis and management of hypotonic hyponatremia propose a diagnostic algorithm based on urine indices (especially the measurement of urine osmolality and sodium) instead of the classical volume status assessment, of which the low sensitivity and specificity are well recognized. However, the use of urine indices is of little utility in patients with TAH, because thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics promote natriuresis and alter urine dilution. Fenske et al proposed the use of fractional uric acid excretion (FUA) in the differential diagnosis of TAH; however, their recommendation was based on data from only 7 patients.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics exert their mechanism of action not only on sodium, but also on chloride and potassium. We therefore aimed to evaluate the possible role of the imbalance between these 3 ions in the differential diagnosis of TAH. To do so, we calculated the simplified strong ion difference (serum sodium + potassium − chloride), a part of the Stewart model for acid-base disturbances. In brief, the Stewart model represents an alternative to bicarbonate-centered approaches and is especially used in anesthesiology and intensive care. According to Stewart, acid-base balance is the result of the strong ions difference (SID, calculated as the sum of measured cations minus the sum of measured anions), weak acids, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and aims to maintain electroneutrality in extracellular fluid. In stable patients with no critical illness (absence of severe hypoalbuminemia, of acute renal failure and/or respiratory failure), the simplified aSID could be sufficient to evaluate acid-base balance. A value > 40 mmol/L identifies patients with fluid depletion and contraction alkalosis due to relative hypochloremia, whereas a value < 40 mmol/L identifies patients with acidosis due to relative excess of water and therefore in need of fluid restriction.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^113Qw3rs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Chlorthalidone is currently recommended as the preferred thiazide diuretic to treat hypertension, but no trials have directly compared risks and benefits.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide as first-line therapies for hypertension in real-world practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation in a Network of Databases (LEGEND) observational comparative cohort study with large-scale propensity score stratification and negative-control and synthetic positive-control calibration on databases spanning January 2001 through December 2018. Outpatient and inpatient care episodes of first-time users of antihypertensive monotherapy in the United States based on 2 administrative claims databases and 1 collection of electronic health records were analyzed. Analysis began June 2018.

Exposures

Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome including the first 3 outcomes and sudden cardiac death. Fifty-one safety outcomes were measured.

Results

Of 730 225 individuals (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [13.3] years; 450 100 women [61.6%]), 36 918 were dispensed or prescribed chlorthalidone and had 149 composite outcome events, and 693 337 were dispensed or prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and had 3089 composite outcome events. No significant difference was found in the associated risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalized heart failure, or stroke, with a calibrated hazard ratio for the composite cardiovascular outcome of 1.00 for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide (95% CI, 0.85–1.17). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly higher risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.72; 95% CI, 2.38–3.12), hyponatremia (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16–1.47), acute renal failure (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15–1.63), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09–1.42), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12–1.30). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly lower risk of diagnosed abnormal weight gain (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.86).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that chlorthalidone use was not associated with significant cardiovascular benefits when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, while its use was associated with greater risk of renal and electrolyte abnormalities. These findings do not support current recommendations to prefer chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment in first-time users was found. We used advanced methods, sensitivity analyses, and diagnostics, but given the possibility of residual confounding and the limited length of observation periods, further study is warranted.

### Desmopressin acetate (Ddavp) [^113BDRdJ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNING: HYPONATREMIA

DDAVP can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

DDAVP is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as patients with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Ensure the serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequently monitor serum sodium in patients 65 years of age and older and in patients at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If hyponatremia occurs, DDAVP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Diuretic therapy in heart failure — supportive evidence indicates controlled trials increased urinary sodium excretion, decreased physical signs of fluid retention, and improved symptoms, QOL, and exercise tolerance; registry data revealed reduced 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared with no diuretic use after discharge; in outpatients, low-dose therapy is titrated until urine output increases and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily; diuretic resistance can be addressed by escalation of loop diuretic dose, intravenous bolus or continuous infusion, or combining diuretic classes; combining a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (e.g., metolazone) with a loop diuretic enhances natriuresis but, in a propensity-score matched analysis of hospitalized heart failure, adding metolazone increased hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality, whereas higher loop diuretic doses were not found to adversely affect survival; the DOSE trial supports the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretics.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Telmisartan

Limited data are available with regard to overdosage of telmisartan in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with telmisartan are hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable.

Hydrochlorothiazide

The most common signs and symptoms observed in patients with a hydrochlorothiazide overdose are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. The oral LD50of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in both mice and rats.

Prevalence and causes of hyponatremia in CRS patients

On admission, 34.4% of CRS patients presented with hyponatremia. Among them, 9 (3.4%) patients had a severe, 22 (8.4%) patients a moderate, and 59 (22.5%) patients a mild hyponatremia on admission. In 7 (2.7%) non-hyponatremic CRS patients, a hypernatremia (maximum Na: 150 mmol/L) was found. As Fig. 2 demonstrates, hyponatremia correlated with serum osmolality in terms of a hyposmolar hyponatremia. A reduced urinary-sodium concentration (< 30 mmol/L) was found in 5 (5.6%) patients of the hyponatremic cohort versus 6 (3.5%) patients of the non-hyponatremic cohort. Likewise, collecting urine measurements showed a reduced urinary sodium excretion of less than 100 mmol/d (equaling 6 g/d sodium chloride) in 13 or 14.4% of hyponatremic versus 14 or 8.1% of non-hyponatremic CRS patients. As a contrasting finding, urinary sodium wasting (sodium excretion of > 300 mmol/d or > 18 g/d sodium chloride) was seen more often in the hyponatremia (26%) than in the non-hyponatremia cohort (13%).

Fig. 2
Group-wise display of calculated serum osmolality on admission according to presence or absence of mild (Na < 135 mmol/L, Na ≥ 130 mmol/L) or moderate-to-severe (Na < 130 mmol/L) hyponatremia. The following formula was used: serum osmolality = 2x Na (mmol/L) + Urea (mmol/L) + Glucose (mmol/L). Numbers indicate the available calculated results per group

Hypovolemia was more frequently encountered in hyponatremic than in non-hyponatremic CRS patients (Fig. 3). Thee prevalence of diarrhea, the number of prescribed diuretic drug classes and, if applicable, the dosages of hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide were the possible underlying reasons accounting for the observations made. (Table 1). Diarrhea on admission was more frequently present in CRS patients both with mild (9 of 59 or 15.3%) and moderate-to-severe hyponatremia (7 of 31 or 22.6%) than in non-hyponatremic ones (9 of 172 or 5.2%, p = 0.0025).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide‑type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia, other than emergency treatment for life‑threatening hyperkalemia, can also be managed with initiation of potassium‑lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid‑day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life‑threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1126nxri]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because lisinopril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with lisinopril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^11336w5M]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

UNa + > 30 mmol/l

If UNa + is > 30 mmol/l, occult diuretics and extracellular fluid status should be checked to proceed with the differentiation of likely causes of hyponatraemia (Figure 1). As diuretic increase renal Na + excretion, UNa + might be increased when it is measured within the time range that it remains active. Diuretics and mainly thiazides are a common cause of hyponatraemia in clinical practice and in patients with stroke. Thiazides were initially believed to cause hyponatraemia by inducing renal Na + loss leading to volume depletion, but they might directly induce ADH release or increase the response of the collecting renal duct. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (spironolactone and eplerenone) and amiloride are also associated with hyponatraemia. Despite the potential for causing more UNa + loss, loop diuretics rarely result in hyponatraemia as they reduce osmolality in the renal medulla limiting thus kidney's urine concentration ability. To conclude, clinicians must interpret UNa + concentrations ⩾ 30 mmol/l with caution in case of treatment with diuretics and keep in mind that patients may not be aware of being treated with diuretics or that their use may not have been recorded. Of note, a fractional urine excretion of uric acid (FE UA) ⩾ 12% may be superior to UNa + concentration to differentiate reduced effective circulating volume from SIADH as the underlying cause of hyponatraemia in case of diuretic therapy. Likewise, copeptin, which is coproduced by the enzymatic cleavage of the vasopressin prohormone, can be used as a surrogate marker for vasopressin. In that case, plasma copeptin levels have been found higher in patients with hypo- or hypervolemic hyponatremia than in patients with SIADH. Considering the fact that hypovolemia is characterized by high plasma copeptin and low UNa +, the plasma copeptin to UNa + ratio might be useful in differentiating hypovolemic hyponatraemia from SIADH. Nevertheless, its specificity has not been proved high yet. On the contrary, low plasma copeptin levels are diagnostic for hyponatremia due to polydipsia.

### Current and future burdens of heat-related hyponatremia: a nationwide register-based study [^113xDA7Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Following the 2003 heat wave in Europe, surveillance systems and public health plans designed to improve adaptation to extreme heat were implemented in several European countries. Over the next decade, excess mortality due to heat decreased in metropolitan areas of continental Europe, but not in the Nordic countries. Poor public awareness about the negative impact of extreme temperatures, and lack of strategies for protecting vulnerable subgroups have been cited as likely explanations for these differences.

The causal pathways by which high ambient temperatures lead to hyponatremia are not completely understood, and they cannot be explored in this study. Fluid and electrolyte losses through sweating and use of diuretics, in combination with intake of hypotonic fluids, has been proposed as an important mechanism. Still, most cases of diuretic-induced hyponatremia are caused by thiazides, and paradoxically, the pathophysiologic mechanism in thiazide induced hyponatremia involves fluid retention more than loss of electrolytes. The ability to increase sweating in response to rising ambient temperatures declines with age, much the same as the ability to excrete free water. Therefore, excessive fluid intake, with or without preexisting SIADH, may also be an important cause of heat-related hyponatremia.

Temperature thresholds, at which heat-related deaths accelerate, are known to vary by geographical location, which could be an effect of behavioral adaptations to local climates. The same is most likely true for hyponatremia, and the 15 °C threshold observed in this study may therefore be representative for cool temperate regions only. The prevalence of profound hyponatremia (< 125 mmol/L) in Emergency Departments or on admission to hospital varies greatly across regions. However, estimates originating from hot humid regions, exemplified by Australia, Singapore, and Taiwan are higher than estimates originating from temperate regions. This could reflect fundamental differences in healthcare systems, but it is consistent with higher ambient temperatures leading to hyponatremia. While rarely fatal in itself, hyponatremia is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher readmission rates, and without adaptive measures the increased burden of hyponatremia and other heat-related morbidities will strain the healthcare system.

### Risk of hyponatremia with diuretics: chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide [^113qo8JG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are often considered as interchangeable. However, greater (nighttime) blood pressure reduction, and alleged pleiotropic effects have renewed the interest in chlorthalidone. A recent study showed an increased risk of adverse events with chlorthalidone, including hyponatremia.

Methods

To investigate differences in risk of hyponatremia between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, adjusted for daily dose, we conducted a population-based case-control study within the Dutch IPCI (Integrated Primary Care Information) database. The study population included all subjects ≥ 18 years without diabetes mellitus, heart failure, liver failure, and malignancy, who were registered in the IPCI database from 1996 to 2011. Cases were subjects with a serum sodium < 130 millimoles per liter or hospitalization due to hyponatremia. Controls were matched on practice, age within 5 years, sex, and date of onset.

Results

A total of 1033 cases of hyponatremia were identified. Hyponatremia was more common with chlorthalidone than with hydrochlorothiazide at equal dose per day: adjusted odds ratio was 2.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–3.88) for 12.5 milligrams per day and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.15–2.57) for 25 milligrams per day. Risks were not significantly increased with chlorthalidone compared with twice the dose per day of hydrochlorothiazide.

Conclusions

This is the first study that shows an increased risk of hyponatremia with chlorthalidone relative to hydrochlorothiazide at equal milligram-to-milligram dose per day. The need for a lower dose of chlorthalidone than hydrochlorothiazide to achieve similar blood pressure reduction likely compensates for the increased risk of hyponatremia at equal dose.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115qcw8c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

There are also several weaknesses to this analysis. The trial only included individuals previously taking hydrochlorothiazide and likely limited adverse effects associated with thiazide diuretics (ie, hyponatremia). Similarly, individuals switched to chlorthalidone experienced a greater incidence of self-reported adverse events and switches back to hydrochlorothiazide. This was likely related to trial design, as those randomized to chlorthalidone started taking a new medication, whereas those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide continued taking a medication that they previously tolerated. The trial randomized patients to chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, and after randomization all follow-up was left to the primary care physician. There were no protocoled laboratory evaluations, including for kidney function or potassium levels. Results presented are from clinically evaluated laboratory values, resulting in varying numbers of laboratory values for each participant. This may have led to differential outcome ascertainment by group; however, it is likely that randomization removed both measured and unmeasured confounding for follow-up care. Dialysis initiation was ascertained using claims data, which have high specificity but lack sensitivity. Although some events may have been missed, it is likely that these missed events were balanced between groups given the randomized study design. Another limitation is that 95% of participants were initially taking the lower doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (12.5 mg/d), so any potential harmful or beneficial kidney effects of the 50- or 25-mg doses, respectively, may have been missed.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia, report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^115zTKGG]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening adverse side effect of thiazide diuretics. This sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database focuses on current management practices of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) and compares differences between TAH and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Methods

We analyzed 477 patients from 225 US and EU sites with euvolemic hyponatremia ([Na+] ≤ 130 mEq/L) who were receiving a thiazide diuretic. Of these, 118 met criteria for true thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH).

Results

Thiazide was withdrawn immediately after hyponatremia was diagnosed only in 57% of TAH; in these patients, the median rate of [Na+] change (Δdaily[Na+]) was significantly higher than those with continued thiazide treatment (3.8 [interquartile range: 4.0] vs. 1.7 [3.8] mEq/L/day). The most frequently employed therapies were isotonic saline (29.6%), fluid restriction (19.9%), the combination of these two (8.2%), and hypertonic saline (5.2%). Hypertonic saline produced the greatest Δdaily[Na+] (8.0[6.4] mEq/L/day) followed by a combination of fluid restriction and normal saline (4.5 [3.8] mEq/L/day) and normal saline alone (3.6 [3.5] mEq/L/day). Fluid restriction was markedly less effective (2.7 [2.7] mEq/L/day). Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 3.1% overall, but in up to 21.4% given hypertonic saline. Although there are highly significant differences in the biochemical profiles between TIH and SIADH, no predictive diagnostic test could be derived.

Conclusions

Despite its high incidence and potential risks, the management of TAH is often poor. Immediate withdrawal of the thiazide is crucial for treatment success. Hypertonic saline is most effective in correcting hyponatremia but associated with a high rate of overly rapid correction. We could not establish a diagnostic laboratory-based test to differentiate TIH from SIADH.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111k51YW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Directions for Future Research

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitals and is associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, though causality remains to be clarified in future trials. SIAD is a frequent cause, but is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires careful workup. Approximately half of patients with SIAD do not respond to first-line therapy with FR. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to definitively guide second-line management of hypotonic hyponatremia, with only tolvaptan and empagliflozin subject to RCTs compared with placebo.

Based on current guidelines, and new information published since, tolvaptan and urea have emerged as the most effective second-line therapies in SIAD if FR fails. There is a need for further research such as RCTs of FR with and without urea (the use of placebo comparison complicated by urea's distinctive taste); tolvaptan vs FR; and comparison of second-line therapy after FR with tolvaptan, urea, or SGLT2is. Trials conducted in inpatients with moderate-severe hyponatremia reflecting real-world clinical care needs are lacking. It is possible that with further evidence, medications such as vaptans or urea may ultimately complement or supersede FR as the first-line treatment for SIAD, where targeted treatment addressing the underlying cause is not effective or if there are clinical or biochemical characteristics to suggest FR is unlikely to succeed.

Tolvaptan, urea, and SGLT2is (as all active hyponatremia treatments) carry a potential risk of sodium overcorrection — likely tolvaptan more so, though direct comparison is lacking. Close monitoring and readiness to administer prophylactic hypotonic fluid and/or DDAVP are key when prescribing medication to raise serum sodium concentration, to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

Areas for future research

Diagnosis

### Diuretic use and risk of vertebral fracture in women [^1119KgWt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral fracture is the most common type of osteoporotic fracture. While thiazide diuretics, which are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, decrease calciuria, they may also induce hyponatremia, which has been associated with increased vertebral fracture risk. Loop diuretics increase calciuria, which would reduce bone mineral density and increase vertebral fracture risk, but they rarely cause hyponatremia. Recent studies on diuretics and fractures did not include or specifically examine vertebral fracture. The few studies of diuretics and vertebral fracture have been limited by cases defined by self-report or administrative data, relatively small number of cases, study design that was not prospective, and lack of long-term follow-up with updated information on diuretic use.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of thiazide diuretic use, loop diuretic use, and risk of incident clinical vertebral fracture in 55,780 women, 55–82 years of age, participating in the Nurses' Health Study, without a prior history of any fracture. Diuretic use was assessed by questionnaire every 4 years. Self-reported vertebral fracture was confirmed by medical record review. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to simultaneously adjust for potential confounders.

Results

Our analysis included 420 incident vertebral fracture cases documented between 2002 and 2012. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of clinical vertebral fracture for women taking thiazides compared with women not taking thiazides was 1.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.18–1.85). The multivariate adjusted relative risk of vertebral fracture for women taking loop diuretics compared with women not taking loop diuretics was 1.59 (95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.25).

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics are each independently associated with increased risk of vertebral fracture in women.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^113ejyCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Chloride and potassium balance in urine represents a sodium-independent marker of kidney response to diuretic-induced volume depletion. Processes going on at the level of intercalated cells are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence of a sodium-independent chloride reabsorption in response to changes in volume and metabolic status. A low urine chloride is a known sign of hypovolemia. It triggers renin release and intercalated cells activation, thus aggravating potassium depletion caused by thiazide. Therefore, we further aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of the balance between chloride and potassium in urine in the differential diagnosis of TAH. The goal of our analysis was to find an additional tool for the initial assessment of profound hyponatremia in the context of hospitalization and unreliable canonical urine indices.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116mPvxH]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Medications

Medications are an important cause of hyponatremia to consider. Medications can cause SIAD through stimulating AVP release, potentiating its action, contributing to altered osmotic set point, or being a direct AVP analogue (Table 5). Medications with a natriuretic effect can mimic SIAD by causing hypovolemic hyponatremia with an increased UNa concentration. Thiazide diuretics are one of the most common causes of hyponatremia and are an important differential diagnosis for SIAD. Up to 13% of patients taking thiazides develop hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics act at the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule to block sodium resorption, which impairs urinary dilution, resulting in free water retention and sodium excretion that can contribute to hyponatremia. A genetic susceptibility to thiazide-associated hyponatremia has been identified, with approximately 50% of those affected found to have a single-nucleotide variation in the SLCO2A1 gene encoding a prostaglandin transporter expressed in the renal collecting duct, a variant that activates water resorption in the collecting duct despite suppression of AVP. Thiazide-induced hyponatremia is likely to reoccur with repeat exposure, so should be recorded as an adverse reaction in the medical record. A rechallenge study in 11 patients with a history of previous thiazide-induced hyponatremia found that a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg caused a fall in serum sodium (mean 5.5 mmol/L) in 6 hours, but minimal change in controls. Other medications that cause hyponatremia and resemble SIAD through salt-wasting diuresis include the antibiotic trimethoprim (and by extension, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), especially at higher doses. Of course, these common medications and underlying organic SIAD also frequently coexist, so the presence of potentially hyponatremia-causing medication does not rule out SIAD.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115rzAjH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelinerecommends thiazide and thiazidelike diuretics as one of the first-line treatment classes. Hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly prescribed member of the class, but the guideline states that chlorthalidone is preferred on the basis of longer half-life and proven trial reduction of cardiovascular disease. However, to our knowledge there are no large, completed randomized clinical trials comparing these medications, although one is in progress. Indirect network meta-analyses showed superior effectiveness with chlorthalidone, but a large observational study showed approximately equal effectiveness. Short-term, small randomized clinical trials, showed only nominal differences in safety issues such as hypokalemia, but the observational studyshowed a worse safety profile for chlorthalidone with higher rates of hypokalemia and hyponatremia.

Both indirect network meta-analyses and traditional observational studies are vulnerable to bias, but recent analytic methods are providing improved strategies to mitigate this risk. These strategies include the balancing of large numbers of baseline patient covariates to make comparison groups more equivalent, using many negative controls to detect and correct residual bias, and testing of the consistency among heterogeneous data sources. We used these techniques to compare chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on 55 outcomes in 3 large observational databases of patients from the United States.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^113CqQxM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^116MLdD9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because enalapril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with enalapril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see Drug Interactions, Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide on urinary calcium excretion in dent disease: an uncontrolled trial [^117W9YGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide doses equivalent to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) have been proposed to correct hypercalciuria and prevent kidney failure in patients with Dent disease. However, they can cause adverse metabolic effects in the long term. In treating hypertension in children, lower thiazide doses have been shown to be as effective and well tolerated.

Study Design

Uncontrolled trial, with forced-titration sequential open-label study design.

Setting & Participants

7 boys with genetically confirmed Dent disease and mild phenotype (neither overt sodium wasting nor kidney failure).

Intervention

After a 1-month run-in period, patients sequentially received amiloride (5 mg/d) alone (1 month) and then for 3 periods of 2 months in association with increasing doses of HCTZ (< 0.2, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/d).

Outcomes

Urinary calcium excretion and extracellular volume indicators.

Measurements

At the end of each period, 2 daily 24-hour urinary collections were performed on the days preceding admission. Blood and spot urine samples also were collected.

Results

A greater HCTZ dose increased renin, aldosterone, and plasma protein concentrations. Amiloride alone had no effect on calcium excretion. The greatest HCTZ doses decreased spot urinary calcium excretion by 42% compared with baseline (median, 0.3; minimum, maximum, 0.2, 0.8 versus median, 0.8; minimum, maximum, 0.4, 1.1, respectively; P = 0.03). However, patients developed adverse reactions, including muscle cramps (n = 2), biological (n = 7) or symptomatic hypovolemia (n = 1), hypokalemia (n = 4), and hyponatremia (n = 1), which all corrected after treatment withdrawal.

Limitation

Small sample size and absence of a control group.

Conclusion

HCTZ doses greater than 0.4 mg/kg/d decreased calcium excretion, but were associated with significant adverse events. Thiazide diuretic therapy should be considered with caution in children with Dent disease.

### A review of drug-induced hyponatremia [^115oCpKe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium level < 134 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients. Certain drugs (eg, diuretics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics) have been implicated as established causes of either asymptomatic or symptomatic hyponatremia. However, hyponatremia occasionally may develop in the course of treatment with drugs used in everyday clinical practice (eg, newer antihypertensive agents, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors). Physicians may not always give proper attention in time to undesirable drug-induced hyponatremia. Effective clinical management can be handled through awareness of the adverse effect of certain pharmaceutical compounds on serum sodium levels. Here, we review clinical information about the incidence of hyponatremia associated with specific drug treatment and discuss the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112hA3jW]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics and decongestion strategies in patients with HF — In patients with HF who have fluid retention, diuretics are recommended to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, and prevent worsening HF. For patients with HF and congestive symptoms, addition of a thiazide (eg, metolazone) to treatment with a loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who do not respond to moderate- or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte abnormalities. Loop diuretics are the preferred diuretic agents for use in most patients with HF, while thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide may be considered in patients with hypertension and HF and mild fluid retention. Metolazone or chlorothiazide may be added to loop diuretics in patients with refractory edema unresponsive to loop diuretics alone. Diuretics should be prescribed to patients who have evidence of congestion or fluid retention, and in any patient with a history of congestion, maintenance diuretics should be considered to avoid recurrent symptoms. The treatment goal of diuretic use is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, using the lowest dose possible to maintain euvolemia. With the exception of MRAs, the effects of diuretics on morbidity and mortality are uncertain, and diuretics should not be used in isolation but always combined with other GDMT for HF that reduces hospitalizations and prolongs survival. Hyponatremia complicates HF management.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^1165iio3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive medication considerations in older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — recent evidence comparing classes indicates that many, such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, have comparable effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) may also have cardiovascular and renal benefit for persons with DM; older adults with DM who are taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB should have renal function and serum potassium levels monitored after approximately 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy, with each dosage increase, and at least yearly, and older adults with DM who are prescribed a thiazide diuretic should be monitored for hyponatremia within approximately 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy, with each dosage increase, and at least yearly.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^115S7wM4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen.

Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients.

Cough

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^117Fo9nq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This secondary analysis of 98 hospitalized patients with profound hypotonic hyponatremia showed that chloride and potassium in addition to calculation of fractional uric acid excretion represents a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of TAH.

One could argue that withdrawal of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic is effective in hyponatremia treatment, and therefore additional treatments are not required. However, sodium levels in general only slightly increase after withdrawing of thiazides and therefore drug withdrawal alone may be insufficient. Especially in the context of profound hyponatremia, it is important to not put the patients at risk of a further decrease in sodium levels, and thus to immediately start with the appropriate treatment. As both volume-depleted and SIAD-like TAH appear euvolemic and have similar urine indices, the choice of an appropriate treatment represents a clinical challenge.

In our study, a simplified aSID excluded the need of fluid substitution for values < 39 mmol/L with a high sensitivity, and showed a high specificity for the need of fluid substitution for values > 42 mmol/L. Because a higher aSID is indicative of an alkalosis in the model of Stewart, we postulate that patients with aSID > 42 mmol/L have a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic-induced contraction alkalosis. Interestingly, bicarbonate did not display the same efficacy in identifying these alkalotic patients. This might be explained by the fact that a high bicarbonate level does not identify univocally metabolic alkalosis and is therefore not useful in identifying patients with contraction alkalosis. Importantly, results remained similar after excluding patients using antidepressants, antiepileptics or neuroleptics, and patients using other type of diuretics, all drugs that represent potential confounders.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: a population-based study [^116hukLw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is one of the most common adverse reactions to thiazide diuretics. In the present study, we analyzed differences in thiazide-associated hyponatremia between men and women and between different categories of age, body mass index (BMI), daily thiazide dose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Study Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting & Participants

13,325 individuals 45 years and older living in a suburb of Rotterdam, as part of the Rotterdam Study.

Predictor

Exposure to thiazide diuretics.

Outcomes

The association between thiazide exposure and hyponatremia (defined as sodium level ≤ 135 mmol/L; mild hyponatremia, 130- ≤ 135 mmol/L; moderate, > 125- < 130 mmol/L; and severe, ≤ 125 mmol/L) was studied in a period covering more than 10 years using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.

Results

718 participants used thiazides at baseline, and 2,738 participants started on thiazide therapy during follow-up. 522 participants developed hyponatremia, of whom 32.4% were exposed to thiazide diuretics at the time of hyponatremia. Thiazide exposure was associated with an almost 5 times higher risk of hyponatremia than no exposure (HR, 4.95; 95% CI, 4.12–5.96). The risk of mild hyponatremia was more than 4.5 times higher in thiazide-exposed individuals; risks of moderate and severe hyponatremia were both 8 times higher in individuals exposed to thiazides. Age and BMI (but not sex [P = 0.8] or estimated glomerular filtration rate [P = 0.2]) significantly modified this risk of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (P < 0.05).

Limitations

Some cases of severe hyponatremia may have been missed if patients were admitted to the hospital without assessment of serum sodium in the general practitioner's laboratory. Nonproportionality of hazards in the first period was explained as possible "depletion of susceptibles" in this closed cohort.

Conclusions

Thiazide use is associated with a substantially increased risk of hyponatremia. Age and BMI significantly influenced the thiazide-associated risk of hyponatremia.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xsjtZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^116v641V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some evidence suggests that chlorthalidone may be superior to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide in older adults.

Design

Propensity score-matched observational cohort study with up to 5 years of follow-up.

Setting

Ontario, Canada.

Patients

All individuals aged 66 years or older who were newly treated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide and were not hospitalized for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction in the prior year were eligible for inclusion. Each chlorthalidone recipient was matched to up to 2 hydrochlorothiazide recipients on the basis of age, sex, year of treatment initiation, and propensity score.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a composite of death or hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Safety outcomes included hospitalization with hypokalemia or hyponatremia.

Results

A total of 29 873 patients were studied. During follow-up, chlorthalidone recipients (n = 10 384) experienced the primary outcome at a rate of 3.2 events per 100 person-years of follow-up, and hydrochlorothiazide recipients experienced 3.4 events per 100 person-years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06]). Patients treated with chlorthalidone were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06 [CI, 2.04 to 4.58]) or hyponatremia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.68 [CI, 1.24 to 2.28]). In 9 post hoc analyses comparing patients initially prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of chlorthalidone per day with those prescribed 12.5, 25, or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day, the former were more likely to be hospitalized with hypokalemia for all 6 comparisons in which a statistically significant association was found. The results of other effectiveness and safety outcomes were also consistent with those of the main analysis.

Limitation

Unmeasured differences in baseline characteristics or physician treatment approaches or an insufficiently large sample may have limited the ability to detect small differences in the comparative effectiveness of the drugs.

Conclusion

As typically prescribed, chlorthalidone in older adults was not associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular events or deaths than hydrochlorothiazide. However, it was associated with a greater incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydrochlorothiazide PO:
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma, acute transient myopia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with an increased risk of acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma, especially in patients with a history of sulfonamide or penicillin hypersensitivity.
- Decreased serum potassium: use caution in patients with brisk diuresis when severe cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, or concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH. Consider prescribing potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements to avoid hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically.
- Decreased serum sodium: use extreme caution in patients with edema during hot water. Monitor serum sodium levels periodically. Restrict water intake in case of dilutional hyponatremia.
- Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydrochlorothiazide can cause hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperuricemia, potentially precipitating a gout attack in susceptible patients. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.
- Exacerbation of SLE: use caution in patients with SLE.
- Hepatic coma: use caution in patients with sever liver disease.
- Hypotension: use caution in patients after sympathectomy.
- Increased blood glucose: use caution in patients with diabetes or prediabetes. Adjust the doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents.
- Increased serum calcium, decreased serum phosphate: use caution in all patients, especially with hyperparathyroidism or prolonged therapy. Discontinue thiazides before obtaining parathyroid function tests.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) [^113cb6Ds]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Hypochloremia

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Renal Stones

Triamterene has been found in renal stones in association with the other usual calculus components. Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be used with caution in patients with a history of renal stones.

Serum Potassium

The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq per liter with 4.5 mEq often being used for a reference point. If hypokalemia should develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods.

Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq per liter require careful observation and treatment. Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium. Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

Serum Creatinine and BUN

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level or both. This apparently is secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly patients and in patients with suspected or confirmed renal insufficiency.

Serum PBI

Thiazide may decrease serum PBI levels without sign of thyroid disturbance.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.
