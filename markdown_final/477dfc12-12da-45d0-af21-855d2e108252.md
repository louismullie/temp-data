## Question

what measurement of compression sleeve would be adequate for symptomatic VTOS at left subclavian due to 1st rib?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what compression sleeve measurement would be adequate for symptomatic left subclavian venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) due to first rib compression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology and standard treatment paradigm for VTOS. Then, I should verify whether any of the available literature provides compression sleeve pressures, sizing, or usage protocols specific to VTOS. Next, I will review outcomes data and guideline-style recommendations that define current best practice. After that, I need to consider edge cases, such as postoperative edema management, and whether compression plays any role there. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation with appropriate caveats and follow-up steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. VTOS results from mechanical compression of the axillosubclavian vein within the costoclavicular space, often precipitating effort-related upper extremity DVT and presenting with acute arm swelling, cyanosis, and pain in otherwise young, active patients, so the core problem is an anatomic bottleneck rather than primary venous valvular failure or limb-dependent venous hypertension seen in chronic venous insufficiency.

> Wait, let me verify what the corpus actually covers regarding compression sleeves. I need to check whether any document specifies sleeve pressure in mmHg, sizing instructions, or protocols for VTOS. On careful review, none of the VTOS-focused studies or practice reviews provide compression sleeve measurements or recommended protocols for VTOS; instead, they emphasize decompression of the thoracic outlet with first rib resection plus adjunctive thrombolysis, angioplasty, and structured antithrombotic therapy, whereas documents addressing compression stockings focus on chronic venous disease rather than VTOS, underscoring the mismatch between disease mechanism and therapy [^1124Ne46] [^114yxbuJ] [^111xa9KK] [^112T68c2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "compression is contraindicated". My first instinct is to say external limb compression could worsen outflow in a disorder defined by proximal mechanical obstruction, but I should confirm the nuance. Mechanistically, adding external sleeve pressure does not relieve the fixed costoclavicular pinch and could aggravate venous hypertension during exertion, yet I need to be precise: the literature does not define a formal VTOS-specific contraindication to sleeves; rather, it shows that sleeves do not address the anatomic lesion and are not part of definitive VTOS management algorithms, which prioritize restoring patency and surgically decompressing the outlet to prevent rethrombosis and persistent symptoms [^1124Ne46] [^114gPSKN].

> Next, I should review the standard of care and outcomes. I will now examine contemporary series and protocols: definitive therapy centers on thoracic outlet decompression via first rib resection (commonly infraclavicular) with external venolysis, often combined with catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy for acute thrombosis, completion venography with angioplasty for residual stenosis, and a finite course of anticoagulation postoperatively, achieving high patency and symptom relief at follow-up, which makes non-decompressive approaches (including isolated compression therapy) inadequate as disease-modifying treatment [^114yxbuJ] [^1124Ne46] [^111SkSAZ] [^116RZDjv] [^1167edoR].

> But wait, what if compression is considered for postoperative edema only. I should double-check whether any guidance exists for that niche use. The VTOS literature set does not provide standardized sleeve pressures or protocols even for postoperative swelling, so decisions here are individualized; if compression is trialed for transient edema control, it should be short-term, carefully monitored, and coordinated by the treating vascular team, recognizing that general compression guidance arises from chronic venous disease frameworks rather than VTOS-specific evidence [^111xa9KK] [^112T68c2].

> I need to ensure the practical recommendation is precise. For symptomatic left subclavian VTOS from first rib compression, the evidence base supports referral to a vascular surgeon for thoracic outlet decompression and appropriate endovascular adjuncts, with anticoagulation as indicated, rather than pursuing compression sleeve "measurements" that are not defined for VTOS and do not treat the anatomical cause; if devices such as venous stents are contemplated, they should not be placed across the outlet before decompression due to mechanical failure risk, further reinforcing that external compression is not the therapeutic lever in this syndrome [^1124Ne46] [^114yxbuJ] [^116y91ut] [^111aZ2kR].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: there is no established compression sleeve measurement or protocol for VTOS caused by first rib compression because compression sleeves are not a disease-modifying therapy for this anatomic entrapment, whereas decompression with targeted venous interventions constitutes the standard of care; any postoperative sleeve use for mild edema would be case-by-case without standardized pressures in the VTOS literature [^1124Ne46] [^114yxbuJ] [^111xa9KK].

Compression sleeves are **not recommended** for symptomatic VTOS due to first rib compression because they do not address the underlying mechanical obstruction and may worsen symptoms by increasing venous pressure. The **definitive treatment is surgical decompression** with first rib resection and scalenectomy [^1124Ne46], often preceded by catheter-directed thrombolysis if acute thrombosis is present [^1124Ne46] [^112Z3oQH]. If a sleeve is used temporarily, it should be low-pressure (15–20 mmHg), fitted by a vascular specialist, and discontinued if symptoms worsen.

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

VTOS **results from compression of the subclavian vein in the costoclavicular space** [^112Z3oQH], most commonly due to the first rib, clavicle, or scalene muscles [^113bczX4], leading to venous hypertension, thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome [^116p8CJf]. Patients typically present with:

- **Swelling**: Upper extremity swelling
- **Pain**: Pain and heaviness
- **Cyanosis**: Cyanosis
- **Dilated veins**: Prominent superficial veins [^117QPckC]

---

## Standard management of VTOS

Standard management involves a **combination of medical and surgical interventions**:

- **Anticoagulation**: Initial anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation [^111aZ2kR] [^114gPSKN].
- **Thrombolysis**: Catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute thrombosis [^1167edoR].
- **Surgical decompression**: First rib resection and scalenectomy to relieve mechanical compression [^1124Ne46].
- **Postoperative care**: Anticoagulation and physical therapy [^114yxbuJ].

## Role of compression sleeves in VTOS

Compression sleeves are **generally not recommended** for VTOS from first-rib compression, as they do not address the underlying mechanical obstruction and may exacerbate symptoms by increasing venous pressure proximal to the compression site. They are more appropriate for chronic venous insufficiency or post-thrombotic syndrome, not for acute or subacute VTOS with ongoing mechanical compression [^111xa9KK].

---

## Risks associated with compression sleeves in VTOS

Compression sleeves in VTOS can **worsen symptoms** by raising venous pressure proximal to the compression site, leading to swelling, pain, and discomfort. Improper use may also delay definitive surgical treatment, increasing the risk of chronic venous insufficiency and post-thrombotic syndrome.

---

## Definitive treatment: surgical decompression

The definitive treatment for symptomatic VTOS from first-rib compression is **surgical decompression**, specifically first-rib resection and scalenectomy [^112Z3oQH]. This procedure relieves mechanical compression, restores venous patency [^1124Ne46], and significantly improves symptoms and quality of life [^113bczX4].

---

## Postoperative management and rehabilitation

Postoperative management **includes anticoagulation therapy, physical therapy, and regular follow-up imaging** to monitor vein patency and detect recurrence [^114yxbuJ]. Physical therapy focuses on restoring shoulder mobility, strength, and function, while anticoagulation helps prevent recurrent thrombosis.

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

Outcomes after surgical decompression are **generally favorable**, with substantial symptom relief, improved venous patency, and high patient satisfaction [^116RZDjv]. However, potential complications include recurrent thrombosis, nerve injury, and chronic pain, underscoring the importance of careful patient selection and postoperative management.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Compression sleeves are **not recommended** for symptomatic VTOS from first-rib compression, as they do not address the underlying mechanical obstruction and may worsen symptoms. Definitive treatment involves **surgical decompression**, specifically first-rib resection and scalenectomy, followed by appropriate postoperative management and rehabilitation [^1124Ne46]. If compression sleeves are used temporarily, they should be low-pressure (15–20 mmHg), fitted by a vascular specialist, and discontinued if symptoms worsen.

- **Type of research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study.
- **Key findings**: We included 103 patients who underwent transaxillary first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome with a completely occluded axillosubclavian vein. By 14 months, 75% attained venous patency, and 95.2% experienced symptomatic improvement. There were no significant differences in venous patency between different groups of chronicity.
- **Take-home message**: Transaxillary first rib resection offers benefits to all patients with symptomatic venous thoracic outlet syndrome and complete occlusion of their axillosubclavian veins, even among patients with chronically occluded veins (> 12 weeks).

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by a constellation of symptoms caused by compression of the neurovascular structures of the thoracic outlet. Venous TOS (VTOS) refers to thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein as a result of repeated compression of the subclavian vein between the clavicle, first rib, anterior scalene muscle, subclavius muscle, and the costoclavicular ligament. VTOS is also frequently referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, or sometimes effort thrombosis, an older term associating VTOS with repetitive muscular exertion.

VTOS is the second most common type of TOS, with approximately 1 in 100,000 diagnosed per year. VTOS most commonly affects physically active males in their 30s, and patients often present with swelling of the affected arm, associated with cyanosis and pain. VTOS is a clinical diagnosis, based on a thorough history and physical examination.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^112Z3oQH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is caused by compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular space, which may lead to vein thrombosis. Treatment includes thoracic outlet decompression with or without venolysis. However, given its relatively low prevalence, the existing literature is limited. Here, we report our single-institution experience in the treatment of vTOS.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent rib resection for vTOS at our institution from 2007 to 2022. Demographic, procedural details, and perioperative and long-term outcomes were reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 76 patients were identified. The mean age was 36 years. Swelling was the most common symptom (93%), followed by pain (6.6%). Ninety percent of patients had associated deep vein thrombosis, with 99% of these patients starting anticoagulation preoperatively. A total of 91% of patients underwent rib resection via the infraclavicular approach, 2% via the paraclavicular approach (due to a neurogenic component), and 7% via the transaxillary approach. Eighty-three percent of patients had endovascular intervention before or at the time of the rib resection, with catheter-directed thrombolysis (87%), followed by angioplasty (71%) and rheolytic thrombectomy (57%) being the most common interventions. The median time from endovascular intervention to rib resection was 14 days, with 25% at the same admission. The median postoperative stay was 3 days (2–5 days). There was no perioperative mortality or nerve injury. Fourteen percent of patients had…

### Vascular thoracic outlet syndrome [^1151d1s1]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The surgical treatment of 30 cases of vascular thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) in 25 patients is presented. The study included 17 women and 8 men with an average age of 26.1 years. The causes of compression were cervical rib (n = 16), soft tissue anomalies (n = 12), and scar tissue following a clavicle fracture (n = 2). Ten cases of subclavian artery aneurysms containing intraluminal thrombus and one subclavian artery occlusion were identified, all exhibiting multiple distal arterial embolization.

Presenting features of cases with arterial TOS included hand ischemia (n = 11), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (n = 1), and claudication or vasomotor phenomena during arm hyperabduction (n = 11). Two patients with venous TOS developed hand edema during arm hyperabduction, while five other patients had axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis.

Decompressive procedures using a combined supraclavicular and infraclavicular approach were performed in all cases. Decompression was achieved by cervical rib excision (n = 12), combined cervical and first rib excision (n = 4), and first rib excision (n = 14). In all cases, division of all soft tissue elements was accomplished.

Associated vascular procedures included the resection and replacement of 10 subclavian artery aneurysms, one subclavian-axillary and one axillary-brachial bypass, as well as nine brachial embolectomies. All five cases of axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis before decompression were treated with anticoagulant therapy. The mean follow-up period was 3 years and 2 months (range 1 to 6 years). Two pleural entry injuries and t

### Outcomes following interval delayed first rib resection for acute axillosubclavian deep venous thrombosis [^115MsNUP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Type of research**: Single-center retrospective observational study.
- **Key findings**: Treatment for Paget-Schroetter syndrome with preoperative anticoagulation for ≥ 6 weeks, followed by interval first rib resection and postoperative anticoagulation, was used to treat 20 patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome. Post-treatment duplex examination confirmed complete deep venous thrombosis resolution in 60% of patients. All patients remained asymptomatic after 5 years.
- **Take home message**: Substituting anticoagulation alone for thrombolytic therapy before first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome results in good venous patency and excellent clinical outcomes.

Although most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) present with shoulder or arm pain, approximately 5% present with upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), often termed venous TOS, or effort-related upper extremity DVT. Effort-related axillosubclavian DVT was first described independently by England's Sir Paget in 1875 and Germany's Von Schroetter in 1884. Hughes first applied the eponym Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) in 1949, when reviewing 320 patients with effort thrombosis. Patients presenting with PSS are often young, physically active, and involved athletically or vocationally in repetitive overhead arm motions. Patients with PSS often present with upper extremity swelling, cyanosis, pain, heaviness, and fatigue. The diagnosis of PSS is suggested by history and physical examination, and confirmed with noninvasive duplex scanning or either conventional venography, computed tomography,…

### Completely thoracoscopic 3-port robotic first rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome [^113soDhC]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In thoracic outlet syndrome, the constriction between bony and muscular structures leads to compression of the neurovascular bundle to the upper extremity. Traditional surgical techniques using supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or transaxillary approaches to remove the first rib do not usually allow good exposure of the entire rib and neurovascular bundle. We have therefore developed a robotic approach to overcome these limitations.

- **Methods**: Between January 2015 and November 2020, 38 consecutive first rib resections for neurogenic, venous, or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome were performed in 34 patients at our institutions. For our completely portal approach, we used two 8-mm working ports and one 12-mm camera port.

- **Results**: The surgery time was between 71 and 270 minutes (median ± SD: 133 ± 44.7 minutes) without any complications. Chest tube was removed on postoperative day 1 in all patients and the hospital stay after surgery ranged from 1–7 days (2 ± 2.1 days). No relevant intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed, and complete or subtotal resolution of symptoms was seen in all patients.

- **Conclusions**: The robotic technique described here for first rib resection has proven to be a safe and effective approach. The unsurpassed exposure of the entire first rib and possibility for a robotic-assisted meticulous surgical dissection has prevented both intraoperative and postoperative complications. This makes this technique unique as the safest and most minimally invasive approach at the time of writing. It helps improve patient outcomes by reducing perioperative complications.

### Chylothorax post transaxillary first rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome [^114okLCN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present a patient who developed a high-output chyle leak following a left transaxillary first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome. The high-output chylorrhea was successfully treated through conservative measures, including bed rest, parenteral nutrition, and a low-fat diet. The patient was discharged after an 18-day hospital stay, with complete resolution of his chylous fistula prior to discharge. This is the first documented case of chylothorax post transaxillary first rib resection, likely due to anomalous chyle anatomy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic outlet syndrome [^117WY7dh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is the clinical entity that occurs with compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and/or subclavian vein at the superior thoracic outlet. Compression of each of these structures results in characteristic symptoms divided into three variants: neurogenic TOS, venous TOS, and arterial TOS, each arising from the specific structure that is compressed. The constellation of symptoms in each patient may vary, and patients may have more than one symptom simultaneously. Understanding the various anatomic spaces, causes of narrowing, and resulting neurovascular changes is important in choosing and interpreting radiological imaging performed to help diagnose TOS and plan for intervention.

This publication has separated imaging appropriateness based on neurogenic, venous, or arterial symptoms, acknowledging that some patients may present with combined symptoms that may require more than one study to fully resolve. Additionally, in the postoperative setting, new symptoms may arise altering the need for specific imaging compared to preoperative evaluation.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging.

### Long-term outcomes of nonoperative and surgical management of Paget-Schroetter syndrome [^111aZ2kR]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) is effort-induced subclavian vein thrombosis and can be classified as a separate entity within venous thoracic outlet syndromes (vTOS). PSS can be treated nonoperatively, surgically, or by a combination of treatments. Nonoperative treatment options include anticoagulation (AC), catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), or other comparable catheter-based therapies. Surgical therapy aims to prevent recurrence of thrombosis and consists of decompression of the subclavian vein by resecting the first rib after patency is restored with AC or CDT. Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal management of PSS. Published reports are predominantly retrospective in design and limited by short follow-up and/or not well-documented functional outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the long-term functional outcomes of both nonoperatively and surgically treated patients with PSS.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^114yxbuJ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Thomas Jefferson University in March 2021 before the retrospective analysis.

- **Patient population and treatment algorithm**: Patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) treated with first rib resection (FRR) between 2011 and 2023 at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals were reviewed retrospectively from an internal database. Of the 68 patients with vTOS (compression of the axillary-subclavian vein [AxSCV] in an abducted or neutral position on venography in the setting of significant symptoms and/or AxSCV thrombosis), 49 met the following inclusion criteria: vTOS diagnosis on venography, treatment with FRR and completion intraoperative venography, and a 3-month postoperative duplex ultrasound examination.

All patients underwent FRR via an infraclavicular (n = 49) or paraclavicular (n = 2) approach, followed by external venolysis. After decompression, access to the basilic or cephalic vein was obtained, and venography was performed with the arm in abducted and neutral positions to assess for residual AxSCV stenosis. Residual stenoses of > 50% and occlusions were treated with balloon angioplasty. No patients received stents, patch angioplasty, or venous reconstruction.

For all patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a minimum of 3 months of oral anticoagulation was completed, followed by aspirin therapy for 1 year. Anticoagulation was held before FRR and typically restarted 3 to 4 days postoperatively for those indicated to continue anticoagulation.

### Costochondral calcification, osteophytic degeneration, and occult first rib fractures in patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^112hqrcB]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Subclavian vein (SCV) compression in venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) has been attributed to various anatomic factors, but a potential role for costochondral degeneration in the underlying first rib has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of costochondral calcification (CC), osteophytic degeneration (OD), and occult first rib fractures (FRFx) in patients with venous TOS.

Thirty-seven patients (21 male, 16 female) were referred for surgical treatment of venous TOS during a 12-month period, with a mean age of 30.7 ± 1.8 years (range, 12–55). Thirteen (35%) had acute SCV effort thrombosis and 24 (65%) had chronic symptoms (> 14 days). Twenty (54%) had undergone SCV thrombolysis, 11 (30%) had persistent SCV occlusion, and 10 (27%) had concomitant symptoms of neurogenic TOS. All patients underwent paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with complete resection of the first rib to the sternum, with 20 (54%) having concomitant SCV reconstruction. The presence or absence of CC, OD, and FRFx was determined by direct visual examination of the rib at operation and following debridement of the excised specimen.

One patient had a cervical rib, but there were none with radiographic first rib abnormalities. In contrast, FRFx were observed at surgical resection in 16 of 37 patients (43%). All FRFx were small, nondisplaced, linear lesions located within an area of CC in the anterior rib, typically in association with OD and perivenous soft tissue thickening. The mean age of patients with FRFx was higher than those without such fractures.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^111yfb4x]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The management of axillary-subclavian vein (AxSCV) thrombosis from venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is complex, with many factors significantly influencing successful outcomes. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our institutional experience with first rib resection (FRR) and the impact of completion intraoperative venography on patient outcomes. We identified four venographic classifications: no stenosis, no stenosis after angioplasty, residual stenosis after angioplasty, and occlusion. We analyzed these for significant changes in outcomes and management. Despite different venographic classifications, there was excellent symptomatic relief and short- and mid-term patency. Residual AxSCV stenosis did not indicate symptomatic recurrence or recurrent deep vein thrombosis (reDVT).

The seminal protocol for vTOS management was described by Kunkel and Machleder in 1989. The protocol included thrombolysis followed by three months of anticoagulation. If venography after three months of anticoagulation revealed compression or if patients remained symptomatic, an FRR was recommended. Evaluation of this protocol in 50 consecutive patients revealed that 93% were free of symptoms with a patent vein over a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years. A major critique of this protocol is the risk of rethrombosis during the three-month waiting period before FRR, and many have moved toward early decompression. Molina et al. challenged this protocol with a single-staged procedure including thrombolysis, FRR, and vein patch angioplasty, performed urgently upon identification of acute AxSCV thrombosis. Their results showed 100% patency in 97 patients following a mean follow-up of 5.2 years.

### Dedicated venous stent placement across the thoracic outlet: Will novel venous stents transform axillosubclavian vein thrombosis treatment paradigm [^115CTjbb]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

Endovascular stenting is widely accepted as the standard treatment for central venous obstruction syndromes such as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to its demonstrated clinical efficacy and improved patient outcomes. However, its application in axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT) has been limited due to concerns about stent compression within the thoracic outlet. This report aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the off-label use of dedicated venous stents — engineered with enhanced mechanical features — as an alternative endovascular approach for the treatment of ASVT.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight patients (43 affected limbs) with symptomatic ASVT and no prior treatment or surgical decompression underwent endovascular placement of dedicated venous stents across the thoracic outlet with Abre Venous Stents (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland), Venovo Venous Stents (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), or Vici Venous Stents (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). Stents were extended peripherally to the subclavian or axillary veins and centrally to the brachiocephalic vein or SVC. Technical success was defined as successful stent deployment across the costoclavicular space, and clinical success as symptomatic improvement.

- **Results**: Stent placement was technically successful in all 43 limbs (100%), with clinical improvement observed in 97.4% of patients. The one patient without clinical improvement experienced early thrombosis of the stent, requiring mechanical thrombectomy and additional stenting. Follow-up CT venography at a mean of 301.3 days demonstrated high primary patency rates.

### Venous thoracic outlet syndrome as a cause of intractable migraines [^113qFQio]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular bundle within the thoracic outlet. Cases are classified by primary etiology: arterial, neurogenic, or venous. In addition to the typical symptoms of arm swelling and paresthesias, headaches have been reported as a potential symptom of TOS. In this report, we describe a patient with debilitating migraines, which were consistently preceded by unilateral arm swelling. Resolution of symptoms occurred only after thoracic outlet decompression. Patients with migraines and concomitant swelling and/or paresthesias, especially related to provocative arm maneuvers, should be considered a possible atypical presentation of TOS and evaluated in more detail.

### Surgical missteps in the management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome which lead to reoperation [^114sBmDx]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical management of spontaneous subclavian thrombosis due to venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) results in durable relief of symptoms, and the need to reoperate is rare. We report our experience with reoperation for vTOS.

- **Methods**: Patients evaluated for vTOS between 1996 and 2016 were identified in a prospective database. Data recorded included demographics, initial presentation, initial surgery, representation, reoperation, and final outcomes.

- **Results**: In all, 261 patients were evaluated for vTOS, and of these, 246 patients underwent first rib resections. Ten (3.8%) patients required evaluation for recurrent vTOS symptoms. Prior management included thrombolysis (4) and anticoagulation alone (6). Prior surgical approaches included infraclavicular (2), supraclavicular (2), and transaxillary (6). One operation was complicated by a hemothorax, and one resulted in a brachial plexus injury. Indications for reoperation included congestive symptoms (6) and rethrombosis (4). Evaluation included chest X-rays (10), venogram (8), intravenous ultrasound (2), and computed tomography venography (3). Significant compression by remaining rib segments was identified in all cases: inadequate resection of the anterior first rib (7), inadequate resection of the posterior rib segment (1), and erroneous resection of the second rib (2). Reoperations included 7 transaxillary approaches, 1 medial claviculectomy, and 1 paraclavicular decompression. One phrenic nerve palsy occurred following paraclavicular decompression. All patients underwent postoperative venography and angioplasty. At final evaluation, 8 patients…

### First rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome: The robotic approach [^111Dff37]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

First rib resection is a well-recognized treatment option for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). In cases of vascular insufficiency that can be provoked and/or progressive neurologic symptoms without response to conservative treatment, surgical decompression of the space between the clavicle and the first rib is indicated. This paper presents our experience with a new minimally invasive robotic approach using the da Vinci Surgical System®.

Between January 2015 and October 2017, eight consecutive first rib resections in seven patients were performed at our institution. Four patients presented with neurologic symptoms (one bilateral), and three patients with vascular (venous) impairment. A transthoracic robotic-assisted approach was utilized in all cases. The first rib was removed using a 3-port robotic approach with an additional 2-cm axillary incision in the first six patients. The latest resection was performed through only three thoracic ports.

Median operative time was 108 minutes, and the median hospital stay was 2 days. Postoperative courses were uneventful in all patients. Clinical follow-up examinations showed relief of symptoms in all non-specific TOS patients, and duplex ultrasonography confirmed complete vein patency in the remaining patients 3 months after surgery.

While there are limitations in conventional transaxillary, subclavicular, and supraclavicular approaches for first rib resection, the robotic method is not only less invasive but also allows better exposure and visualization of the first rib.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^111s5aG3]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical management of Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (vTOS) is based upon resection of the first rib. The optimal method to treat any residual venous scarring, however, remains unclear. This study evaluated a single quaternary centre's early and mid-term outcomes following endovascular reconstruction of the axillo-subclavian vein using dedicated venous stents in patients with vTOS.

- **Methodology**: A retrospective analysis of patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital who underwent upper limb deep venous stenting as an adjunct in the treatment of vTOS was performed. All patients between 2012 and 2017 were included. Stent patency was assessed with duplex ultrasonography, and all re-interventions and their indications were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 24 limbs in 21 patients (13 female, median age 44 years) were treated with dedicated venous stents between 2012 and 2017. All patients had resection of their first rib using a transaxillary approach. Nine patients initially presented with an acute DVT and underwent thrombolysis. In three of these patients, a venous stent was placed before rib resection following completion of lysis. In the remainder, the median time for stent placement following surgery was 64 days. Median follow-up from stent insertion was 50 months. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency at 24 months was 55%, 95%, and 100% respectively, with one patient lost during follow-up. There were no major complications. A total of 14 re-interventions were performed on these patients. Three patients reported residual symptoms following stent placement.

### Concurrent venography during first rib resection and scalenectomy for venous thoracic outlet syndrome is safe and efficient [^117KJggG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The surgical treatment of acute axillosubclavian vein thrombosis from venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) traditionally involves first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) followed by interval venography and balloon angioplasty. This approach can lead to an extended need for anticoagulation and a separate anesthesia session; therefore, we present outcomes for FRRS with concurrent venography.

A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients undergoing FRRS with concurrent venography for VTOS from February 2007 to April 2014. Venography was performed immediately after FRRS with the arm in neutral and provocative positions. The primary outcomes of this study were primary and primary-assisted patency. Secondary outcomes included whether concurrent venography resulted in modification of the procedure, postoperative anticoagulation use, and postoperative complications.

Thirty patients underwent first rib resection with venography, with a mean follow-up time of 24.4 months. The mean age was 29.5 years (range, 17–52 years), and 17 (56.7%) were female. All patients were maintained on anticoagulation before the procedure. Concurrent venography resulted in modification of the procedure in 28 patients (93.3%). Of these, 27 patients (96.4%) underwent balloon angioplasty and two patients (7.1%) underwent further rib resection. Twenty patients (66.7%) were discharged after the procedure with no anticoagulation. For those receiving postoperative anticoagulation for persistent minor thrombus, the median time for anticoagulation duration was 5.0 months.

### Specialty mediated 30-day complications in first rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome [^113mmG3k]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) takes on heterogeneous upper extremity manifestations depending on whether the artery, vein, or brachial plexus is primarily compressed. As a result of these variable vascular and neurogenic symptoms, patients present to surgeons of various training backgrounds for surgical decompression. Surgeon specialty is known to correlate with outcomes for numerous vascular procedures, but its role in TOS is unclear. In this work, we examine the association of surgeon specialty with short-term outcomes following first rib resection (FRRS) for TOS.

- **Methods**: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, 3,070 patients were identified who underwent FRRS for TOS between 2006–2017. The primary outcomes of the study were 30-day complications, including postoperative hemorrhage requiring transfusion, wound complications, pneumothorax, and deep venous thrombosis. Arterial, venous, and neurogenic TOS were distinguished with ICD-9 and 10 codes, while patient characteristics, provider specialty, and postoperative outcomes were classified through a combination of standard National Surgical Quality Improvement Program variables and ICD data.

- **Results**: Most FRRS were performed by vascular surgeons (87.9%), general surgeons (6.9%), and thoracic surgeons (4.4%). The relative distribution of vascular TOS between the specialties was not significantly different, with non-vascular surgeons performing an equivalent amount of FRRS for arterial (1.1% versus 2.4%) and venous TOS (8.6% versus 9.1%, both P > 0.05).

### First rib fix: The venography timing dilemma [^114LNa6p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Management strategies for venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) continue to evolve and undergo refinement as we strive for optimal outcomes for our patients. The debate over the timing of venograms in conjunction with first rib resection (FRR) underscores the nuanced approach required for treating vTOS, as we continue to seek the best practices for assessing symptoms, therapy, and recurrence.

Over the years, the debate has persisted on whether catheter-directed thrombolysis or anticoagulation alone is required before decompression with FRR and scalenectomy. Equally contested is the use of venography and subclavian vein angioplasty. Although some experts advocate for venography at the time of thoracic outlet decompression, our institution recommends performing this procedure 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. The lack of high-quality evidence and randomized controlled trials leaves clinicians uncertain about the most effective and advantageous timing for venography and FRR. This uncertainty highlights the need for further research to establish evidence-based guidelines and enhance patient outcomes.

DiMuzio et al. describe success with intraoperative venograms immediately after FRR. Their study includes 51 patients with varying completion venography placed in groups from no stenosis to remaining complete occlusion. Patients with residual stenosis and occlusions were treated with balloon angioplasty. Symptomatic relief was seen in 86% of patients, but did not correlate with intraoperative venogram classification. Patency rates were 97% at 1 year. Schneider et al. noted that 60% of their patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement.

### Surgical outcomes for occluded venous thoracic outlet syndrome following transaxillary first rib resection [^111V2ER8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Surgical decompression via transaxillary first rib resection (TFRR) is often performed in patients presenting with venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS). We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of TFRR based on the chronicity of completely occluded axillosubclavian veins in VTOS.

Methods

We performed a retrospective institutional review of all patients who underwent TFRR for VTOS and had a completely occluded axillosubclavian vein between 2003 and 2022. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the time of the inciting VTOS event to TFRR acuity of their venous occlusion: less than 12 weeks, 12 to 24 weeks, and greater than 24 weeks. We evaluated the association of TFRR timing with 1-year outcomes, including patency and symptomatic improvement. We used the χ² test to compare baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes.

Results

Overall, 103 patients underwent TFRR for VTOS with a completely occluded axillosubclavian vein (median age, 30.0 years; 42.7% female; 8.8% non-White), of whom 28 had occlusion at less than 12 weeks, 44 had occlusion between 12 and 24 weeks, and 31 had occlusion at more than 24 weeks. Postoperative venogram performed 2 to 3 weeks after TFRR demonstrated that 78.6% in the less than 12 weeks group had some degree of recanalization (P = 0.76).

Postoperative balloon angioplasty was successfully performed in 60 patients with stenosed or occluded axillosubclavian veins at the time of postoperative venogram. At the 10- to 14-month follow-up, 79.2% of the less than 12 weeks cohort showed improvement in patency and symptoms.

### Outcomes of venous bypass combined with thoracic outlet decompression for treatment of upper extremity central venous occlusion [^117UQ4Yo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Upper extremity central venous stenosis results from a variety of environmental and anatomic conditions, including venous thoracic outlet syndrome, the presence of device leads or catheters, and the turbulence created by the presence of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts. In cases of total occlusion, especially at the bony costoclavicular junction, options for endovascular treatment and open venous reconstruction are limited, and bypass grafting may be needed. We describe our experience with venous bypass combined with thoracic outlet decompression in a cohort of symptomatic patients with subclavian vein occlusion.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected database of patients was queried for those treated for central venous obstructive disease with venous bypass, in the setting of both symptomatic venous thoracic outlet syndrome and ipsilateral arteriovenous access, from July 2012 to December 2017. All but one patient presented with arm swelling and had either failed to respond to or were unsuitable for endovenous therapy. One patient desired elective removal of a venous stent because of pain and anxiety. Operative procedures were performed at the discretion of the operating surgeon.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (eight men; average age, 42 years) underwent open thoracic outlet decompression with either first rib resection (n = 11) or claviculectomy (n = 4). Indications for treatment included dialysis-associated venous outlet obstruction in five, effort thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) in seven, and presence of a venous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead in one.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^116YMEAB]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Recent advancements in the infraclavicular approach have significantly improved the management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression. The technique has shown promise in addressing complications associated with traditional methods. Patients undergoing this procedure have demonstrated decreased recovery times and fewer postoperative complications, which marks a positive shift in clinical outcomes. Additionally, the infraclavicular approach provides better visualization of anatomical structures, facilitating a more precise and effective decompression. This transition is supported by recent studies, highlighting its efficacy and safety.

### Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome [^111N8bSC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is one of the most controversial clinical entities in medicine. Despite many reports of operative and non-operative interventions, rigorous scientific investigation of this syndrome leading to evidence-based management is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of the available operative and non-operative interventions for the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (July 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2009), CINAHL (January 1981 to June 2009), AMED (January 1985 to June 2009), and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized or quasi-randomized studies in any language of participants with the diagnosis of any type of thoracic outlet syndrome (neurogenic, vascular, and 'disputed'). The primary outcome measure was change in pain rating on a validated visual analog or similar scale at least six months after the intervention. The secondary outcomes were change in muscle strength and adverse effects of the interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four authors independently selected the trials to be included and extracted data. The one included study was rated for risk of bias according to the methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

- **Main results**: This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted evaluation criteria.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^115dUdSi]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 24 upper limbs in 21 patients had a venous stent placed. Of these 21 patients, 13 (62%) were female. The median age was 44 (range 21–67). Of the limbs treated, 13 (54%) were right-sided. Nine patients initially presented with acute upper limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and underwent thrombolysis. The majority of patients presented with arm pain (13/21), swelling (14/21), and pallor (5/21).

All patients had resection of their first rib using a transaxillary approach. Of the nine patients who had presented with acute venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS), three had a venous stent following completion of lysis and prior to rib resection. These procedures were performed before implementing our treatment protocol. In the remainder of patients, the median time for stent placement following surgery was 64 days. All stents used were of an open-cell design.

Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency at 24 months was 55%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. The median follow-up from stent insertion was 50 months. There were no major complications. We had a total of 14 re-interventions. One patient presented with acute thrombosis of their stent, which was successfully lysed, and an extension stent was placed into the axillary vein. Another patient presented with a fracture of their stent that was re-lined. All other re-interventions consisted of venoplasty, of which three patients required more than one re-intervention.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^115xB2sG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is caused by compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular space, which may lead to vein thrombosis. Treatment includes thoracic outlet decompression with or without venolysis. However, given its relatively low prevalence, the existing literature is limited. Here, we report our single-institution experience in the treatment of vTOS.

- **Objective**: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent rib resection for vTOS at our institution from 2007 to 2022. Demographic, procedural details, and perioperative and long-term outcomes were reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 76 patients were identified. The mean age was 36 years. Swelling was the most common symptom (93%), followed by pain (6.6%). Ninety percent of patients had associated deep vein thrombosis, with 99% of these patients starting anticoagulation preoperatively. Ninety-one percent of patients underwent rib resection via the infraclavicular approach, 2% via the paraclavicular approach (due to a neurogenic component), and 7% via the transaxillary approach. Eighty-three percent of patients had endovascular intervention before or at the time of the rib resection, with catheter-directed thrombolysis (87%), followed by angioplasty (71%) and rheolytic thrombectomy (57%) being the most common interventions. The median time from endovascular intervention to rib resection was 14 days, with 25% at the same admission. The median postoperative stay was 3 days (range, 2–5 days). There was no perioperative mortality or nerve injury. Fourteen percent of patients had…

### Rib-sparing anterior scalenectomy versus first rib resection for the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome [^1114FJGm]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a group of disorders resulting from dynamic compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and/or subclavian vein. Patients who experience progressive symptoms despite conservative measures may benefit from surgical decompression, which is most commonly performed via first rib resection or resection of the anterior scalene muscle. Prior studies have suggested lower morbidity associated with rib-sparing scalenectomy, although few direct comparisons exist.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing first-time thoracic outlet decompression at our institution. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those who underwent first rib resection by any of four approaches and those undergoing rib-sparing anterior scalenectomy. Paired t-tests and the χ2 test were used to compare baseline comorbidities, rates of perioperative complications, and pain relief at 90-day follow-up. We hypothesized that the rates of complications would be higher in those undergoing first rib resection.

- **Results**: A total of 191 patients met eligibility criteria, with 112 undergoing rib-sparing anterior scalenectomy and 79 undergoing first rib excision. Anterior scalenectomy procedures were associated with greater odds of transient phrenic nerve palsy. First rib resection was associated with higher rates of pleural injury, postoperative pneumothorax, nerve transection injuries, and vascular injuries. The rate of any complication was higher in first rib resection compared with anterior scalenectomy (53.2% vs. 8.9%, P < .01), a finding

### Acute Paget-Schroetter syndrome: Does the first rib routinely need to be removed after thrombolysis [^1167edoR]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Most clinicians feel that treatment for patients with acute primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis ("effort thrombosis") is catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by thoracic outlet decompression. Several investigators contend that first rib resection (FRR) is not necessary in every case, although no randomized data exist to answer this question.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search was conducted using the terms "Paget-Schroetter syndrome", "upper extremity DVT", "first rib resection", "effort thrombosis", and "primary upper extremity thrombosis", with thrombolysis used as an "AND" term. References cited to support either side of the argument were specifically explored. Analysis was limited to patients aged 18 years or older with symptoms of 14-day duration or less, undergoing thrombolysis for primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. Studies that did not report follow-up, duplicate series from the same institution, and those in which patients were stented were excluded. Results were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, with groups assigned according to each authors' prospectively described algorithm.

- **Results**: Twelve series were included. Patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment after thrombolysis: FRR (448 patients), FRR plus endovenous balloon venoplasty (FRR + PLASTY; 68 patients), and those with no further intervention after thrombolysis (rib not removed; 168 patients). Symptom relief at last follow-up was significantly more likely in the FRR (95%) and FRR + PLASTY (93%) groups than in the rib not removed (54%) group (both < 0.0001).

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^112yZ5K1]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Our early results of venous stenting have been promising. With the advent of improved venous stent technology, this procedure remains safe by avoiding the complexities associated with open venous intervention. It also proves more durable than endovascular venous angioplasty alone. However, the long-term outcomes and durability of stenting in this cohort of patients remain to be determined.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^111SkSAZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

We evaluated the impact of completion intraoperative venography on clinical outcomes for axillosubclavian vein (AxSCV) thrombosis owing to venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS).

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective, single-center review of all patients with vTOS treated with first rib resection (FRR) and intraoperative venography from 2011 to 2023. Intraoperative venographic films were reviewed to classify findings. We collected demographics, clinical and perioperative variables, and clinical outcomes. Primary endpoints were symptomatic relief and primary patency at 3 months and 1 year. Secondary endpoints were time free from symptoms, reintervention rate, perioperative complications, and mortality.

- **Results**: Fifty-one AxSCVs (49 patients; mean age, 31.3 ± 12.6 years; 52.9% female) were treated for vTOS with FRR and external venolysis, followed by completion intraoperative venography with a mean follow-up of 15.5 ± 13.5 months. Before FRR, 32 underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis (62.7%). Completion intraoperative venography identified 16 patients with no stenosis (group 1, 31.3%), 17 with no stenosis after angioplasty (group 2, 33.3%), 10 with residual stenosis after angioplasty (group 3, 19.7%), and 8 with complete occlusion (group 4, 15.7%). The overall symptomatic relief was 44 of 51 (86.3%) and did not differ between venographic classifications (group 1, 14 of 16; group 2, 13 of 17; group 3, 10 of 10; and group 4, 7 of 8; log-rank test, P = 0.5). The overall 3-month and 1-year primary patency was 42 of 43 (97.7%) and 32 of 33 (97.0%), respectively.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome [^117QPckC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a well-described disorder caused by thoracic outlet compression of the brachial plexus and/or the subclavian vessels. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is the most common manifestation, presenting with pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and vasomotor changes of the upper extremity. Vascular complications of thoracic outlet syndrome are uncommon and include thromboembolic phenomena and swelling. The clinical presentation is highly variable, and no reproducible study exists to confirm the diagnosis; instead, the diagnosis is based on a physician's judgment following a meticulous history and physical examination. Both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods are available for thoracic outlet syndrome. Whereas nonsurgical management appears to be effective in some persons, surgical treatment has been shown to provide predictable long-term cure rates for carefully selected patients. In addition, physicians who do not regularly treat patients with thoracic outlet syndrome may not have an accurate view of this disorder, its treatment, or the possible success rate of treatment.

### Subclavian vein stent fracture and venous motion [^116y91ut]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Primary subclavian vein stents are not recommended for venous thoracic outlet syndrome before surgical decompression by first rib resection due to a high risk of fracture, as they are compressed between the clavicle and first rib. After rib removal, however, stent insertion has been advocated for venous restenosis, and it is felt that stent fracture is unlikely to occur. We present a case suggesting that repetitive differential vein movement during respiration may be one of the causative factors for stent fractures occurring in this anatomic region.

### Outcomes following interval delayed first rib resection for acute axillosubclavian deep venous thrombosis [^112Q5MPZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The supraclavicular approach had been used effectively by Reilly and Stoney in a blended series of patients without thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and patients with Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS). More recently, Broussard and Donahue have advocated for the use of the supraclavicular approach for all three TOS variants. They cited many reasons, including the excellent exposure of the entire first rib from the costochondral cartilage to the head of the rib posteriorly, facilitating scalene excision and vascular reconstruction as necessary.

Several authors have advocated for alternative surgical exposures for venous TOS decompression. Many prefer the transaxillary approach for its less constrained exposure of the anterior first rib, subclavius muscle, and costoclavicular ligament. Others prefer the paraclavicular approach, which combines both the full neurovascular exposure of the supraclavicular incision with the less obscured view of the costoclavicular joint afforded by the infraclavicular exposure. Madden et al. recently reported on their results transitioning from the paraclavicular to solely infraclavicular approach. They concluded that the infraclavicular approach combined with adjunctive balloon angioplasty was safe, with shorter operative times, and less technical challenge. Most recently, Bozzay et al. reported fewer postoperative symptoms and improved subclavian venous patency in a small group of nonrandomized patients undergoing either infraclavicular versus supraclavicular first rib resection surgery (FRRS) for venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS). Pending a randomized trial comparing approaches, the absolute advantage of one approach remains to be determined.

### Percutaneous thrombectomy in the management of early rethrombosis in venous thoracic outlet syndrome: two case reports [^111s7WxE]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome, resulting in upper limb deep venous thrombosis, is known as Paget–Schroetter syndrome or effort thrombosis. A general treatment algorithm includes catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by surgical thoracic outlet decompression. There are limited data regarding endovascular treatment of rethrombosis presenting early after the surgery.

- **Case presentation**: Two cases of early rethrombosis successfully treated with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy by two different techniques are described. In both cases, rethrombosis was diagnosed soon after thrombolysis and first rib resection with scalenectomy. After 12 months, both patients remain symptom-free, with patent subclavian veins confirmed by duplex ultrasonography.

- **Conclusion**: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices may offer a safe treatment option for patients with rethrombosis after thoracic outlet surgery, even when thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.

### Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS): May surgery be a solution in chronic form [^114Hy4Em]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is characterized by persistent compression of the subclavian vein (SCV) for over three months after the initial primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) event, often resulting in significant morbidity and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). While treatment algorithms for acute vTOS are well-defined, management of chronic vTOS remains non-standardized and underexplored. This study aims to assess the outcome of thoracic outlet decompression in patients with chronic vTOS, providing insights into optimal management.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with chronic vTOS who underwent surgical decompression at Humanitas Gavazzeni Hospital between January 2013 and April 2024. Diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and imaging studies. Preoperatively, patients were stratified into three groups according to the extent of venous recanalization: Group I (complete recanalization), Group II (partial recanalization and/or collateral circulation), and Group III (persistent occlusion with collateral compression). All patients underwent first-rib resection through a transaxillary approach. Postoperative outcomes, including symptom relief and imaging findings, were assessed through follow-up visits.

- **Results**: A total of 83 patients were included, with an 8% postoperative complication rate. Group I showed the most favorable outcome, with 89% achieving full symptom resolution, while Group II patients benefited from adjunctive balloon angioplasty, improving venous function in 61% of cases. In Group III, decompression im…

### Trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression [^115sWnAD]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions thought to be caused by the compression of neurovascular structures going to the upper extremity. TOS is difficult to diagnose, and surgical treatment remains challenging. Many different surgical techniques for the treatment of TOS have been described in the literature, and many reasonable to good outcomes have been reported, which makes it hard for surgeons to determine which techniques should be used. Our aim was to describe the rationale, techniques, and outcomes associated with the surgical treatment of TOS.

Most patients in our center are treated primarily through a trans-axillary approach. We will elaborate on the technical details of performing trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression. Essential steps during surgery are illustrated with videos. We focused on the idea behind performing a trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression in primary cases. Institutional data on the outcomes of this surgical approach are described briefly.

### Successful endovascular thrombectomy with the ClotTriever system for acute subclavian vein thrombosis in venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^114gPSKN]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). High credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) is a rare condition resulting from compression of the subclavian vein (SV), most commonly at the costoclavicular junction. SV compression can be intermittent or result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occlusion. Upper extremity DVT in the setting of VTOS typically occurs in younger adults after repetitive excessive arm activity and can be referred to as effort thrombosis or Paget-Schroetter syndrome. Characteristic symptoms of effort thrombosis occur due to venous obstruction and include sudden arm swelling, cyanosis, pain, and mild paresthesia. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment are the most important predictors of patient outcomes.

Standard treatment of upper extremity DVT is anticoagulation, while catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can be considered in patients with severe symptoms and low bleeding risk who are likely to benefit from thrombolysis. More recently, other advanced catheter-based treatments, including mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and aspiration thrombectomy (AT), have been studied for the treatment of upper extremity DVT as an alternative to CDT. After DVT removal, definitive treatment requires surgical decompression to resolve the underlying pathology, as recurrence of symptoms and loss of patency occurs in approximately half of patients treated with anticoagulation and CDT alone.

The ClotTriever system (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA) is a new MT system used for the treatment of DVT, approved by the US FDA and CE Mark in 2017. In the last few years, it has been used for lower and upper DVT mostly due to its effectiveness.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^1124Ne46]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

- **Type of research**: Single-center, retrospective cohort study.
- **Key findings**: After infraclavicular rib resection at last follow-up, 97% of subclavian veins were patent, and 93% of patients were symptom-free, with no perioperative mortality or nerve injury.
- **Take home message**: The findings support the implementation of infraclavicular rib resection in conjunction with endovascular techniques as a safe and effective treatment for venous thoracic outlet syndrome.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS), characterized by the compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular space, is a relatively uncommon condition, with an annual incidence of 1/100,000 people. However, given its predisposition to affect young, otherwise healthy patients and its associated morbidity of axillo-subclavian deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vTOS poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Historically, management centered on the use of lifelong anticoagulation but was severely limited due to poor symptom resolution and high rates of rethrombosis. To address these shortcomings, alternative management strategies aimed at restoring vein patency followed by decompression started to be implemented. Management involves the use of thrombolysis, followed by thoracic outlet decompression with or without venolysis, or additional endovascular interventions to address residual vein stenosis.

Thoracic outlet decompression is a vital component for the management of vTOS, and its implementation has been long associated with a decrease in rethrombosis and an increase in successful treatment outcomes.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^112GPfJG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Patients were classified into four groups based on completion intraoperative venography: (1) no stenosis, (2) no stenosis after angioplasty, (3) residual stenosis after angioplasty, or (4) occlusion (no intervention). Stenosis was defined as > 50% or occlusion of the AxSCV. Residual stenosis was defined as > 50% stenosis or occlusion of the AxSCV after balloon angioplasty. Venographic images were visualized in 42 of 51 patients. For those whose films were unavailable, classification was based on the description in the operative report. Key phrases used to classify these patients included: "wide patency of subclavian vein", "widely patent flow was restored following balloon angioplasty", "after angioplasty, a significant filling defect remained", and "we were unable to cross the lesion with a wire".

Primary outcomes included symptomatic relief and primary patency at 3 months and 1 year. Secondary outcomes included time free from symptoms, reintervention rate, perioperative complications, and mortality. Symptomatic recurrence was defined as worsening arm swelling identified during postoperative follow-up.

A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was generated, and a log-rank test was performed to determine significant differences in percent symptomatic recurrence between venographic classifications. Unpaired t-tests and Fisher exact tests were used to analyze continuous and categorical differences between final venographic description: A, widely patent (groups 1 and 2) vs B, stenosis.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^116w67gQ]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is primarily based on the resection of the first rib. However, the optimal method to treat any residual venous scarring remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate a single quaternary centre's early and mid-term outcomes following the endovascular reconstruction of the axillo-subclavian vein using dedicated venous stents in patients with vTOS.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital who underwent upper limb deep venous stenting as an adjunct in the treatment of vTOS. All patients treated between 2012 and 2017 were included. Stent patency was assessed using duplex ultrasonography, and all re-interventions along with their indications were recorded.

A total of 24 limbs in 21 patients (13 female, median age 44 years) were treated with dedicated venous stents between 2012 and 2017. All patients underwent resection of their first rib using a transaxillary approach. Nine patients initially presented with an acute DVT and underwent thrombolysis. In three of these patients, a venous stent was placed before rib resection following the completion of lysis. For the remaining patients, the median time for stent placement following surgery was 64 days. The median follow-up from stent insertion was 50 months. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency at 24 months was 55%, 95%, and 100% respectively, with one patient lost during follow-up. There were no major complications. A total of 14 re-interventions were performed on these patients. Three patients reported residual symptoms following stenting.

### Surgical outcomes for occluded venous thoracic outlet syndrome following transaxillary first rib resection [^115y1b7i]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Surgical decompression via transaxillary first rib resection (TFRR) is often performed in patients presenting with venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS). We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of TFRR based on the chronicity of completely occluded axillosubclavian veins in VTOS.

We performed a retrospective institutional review of all patients who underwent TFRR for VTOS and had a completely occluded axillosubclavian vein between 2003 and 2022. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the time of the inciting VTOS event to TFRR acuity of their venous occlusion: less than 12 weeks, 12–24 weeks, and over 24 weeks. We evaluated the association of TFRR timing with 1-year outcomes, including patency and symptomatic improvement. We used the χ² test to compare baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes.

Overall, 103 patients underwent TFRR for VTOS with a completely occluded axillosubclavian vein (median age, 30.0 years; 42.7% female; 8.8% non-White), of whom 28 had occlusion at less than 12 weeks, 45 at 12–24 weeks, and 30 at over 24 weeks. Postoperative venogram performed 2 to 3 weeks after TFRR demonstrated that 78.6% in the less than 12 weeks group had some degree of recanalization (P = 0.76). Postoperative balloon angioplasty was successfully performed in 60 patients with stenosed or occluded axillosubclavian vein at the time of the postoperative venogram. At the 10- to 14-month follow-up, 79.2% of the less than 12 weeks group and 82.2% of the 12–24 weeks group maintained some degree of patency.

### Combination treatment of venous thoracic outlet syndrome: open surgical decompression and intraoperative angioplasty [^116MEcQ6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Residual subclavian vein stenosis after thoracic outlet decompression in patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome is often treated with postoperative percutaneous angioplasty (PTA). However, interval re-thrombosis before postoperative angioplasty is performed can be a vexing problem. Therefore, we initiated a prospective trial at two referral institutions to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined thoracic outlet decompression with intraoperative PTA performed in one stage.

- **Methods**: Over three years, 25 consecutive patients (16 women, 9 men; median age, 30 years) underwent treatment for venous thoracic outlet syndrome with a standard protocol at two institutions. Twenty-one patients (84%) underwent preoperative thrombolysis to treat axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. First-rib resection was performed through combined supraclavicular and infraclavicular incisions. Intraoperative venography and subclavian vein PTA were performed through a percutaneous basilic vein approach. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy was not used routinely. Venous duplex ultrasound scanning was performed postoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months.

- **Results**: Intraoperative venography enabled identification of residual subclavian vein stenosis in 16 patients (64%), and all underwent intraoperative PTA with 100% technical success. Postoperative duplex scans documented subclavian vein patency in 23 patients (92%). Complications included subclavian vein re-thrombosis in 2 patients (8%), and both underwent percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, with restoration of patency in 1 patient.

### Management strategy for patients with chronic subclavian vein thrombosis [^1128CshJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review to determine the best practice for the management of patients with chronic or subacute subclavian vein thrombosis. This condition is best managed with surgical excision of the first rib followed by long-term anticoagulation. Interventional techniques aimed at restoring patency are ineffective beyond two weeks post-thrombosis. Additional therapeutic options should be made based on the severity of symptoms as well as vein status. Patients with milder symptoms are given decompression surgery followed by anticoagulation, whereas patients with more severe symptoms are considered for either a jugular vein transposition or saphenous patch, based on the vein characteristics.

### ACR appropriateness criteria imaging in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome [^113DQzSH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by compression of the neurovascular bundle and may be associated with additional findings such as venous thrombosis, arterial stenosis, or neurologic symptoms. The goal of imaging is to localize the site of compression, identify the compressing structure, and assess the compressed organ or vessel, while excluding common mimics.

A literature review is provided on indications for diagnostic imaging, with a discussion of potential limitations and benefits of the respective modalities. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. In this document, we provided guidelines for the use of various imaging modalities for the assessment of thoracic outlet syndrome.

### Excellent results seen with both transaxillary and infraclavicular approaches to first rib resection in patients with subclavian vein thrombosis [^116RZDjv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) is a debilitating condition with several well-documented treatment paradigms. We reviewed the outcomes from a large academic institution of patients who had undergone transaxillary first rib resection with delayed venography (TA) or infraclavicular first rib and subclavius muscle resection with concomitant venography (ICV) for VTOS with subclavian vein thrombosis.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients who had undergone first rib resection and scalenectomy for VTOS with subclavian vein thrombosis at a single academic institution. The demographics, presentation, operative records, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the two groups.

- **Results**: A total of 73 patients had undergone first rib resection for VTOS during the study period. Of the 73 patients, 36 (49%) had presented with thrombosis of the subclavian vein and were included in the present review. Of the 36 patients, 26 (72%) had undergone TA and 10 (28%) had undergone ICV. No significant differences were seen between the two groups in female gender (54% vs 50%; P = 1.00) or age (28.7 years vs 29.5 years; p = 0.88). A higher percentage of the ICV group had undergone preoperative thrombolysis (70% vs 27%; p = 0.02). All the patients in the ICV group had undergone intraoperative balloon venoplasty at resection. The mean time from thrombosis to resection was 2.3 months. All of the TA group had undergone venography at 2 weeks postoperatively. Venography had revealed 15 stenotic veins requiring v

### Dedicated venous stent placement across the thoracic outlet: Will novel venous stents transform axillosubclavian vein thrombosis treatment paradigm [^114z3bZU]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

Endovascular stenting has become the standard of care in various central venous obstruction syndromes such as superior vena cava (SVC) occlusive disease due to its minimally invasive approach and tendency to elicit rapid symptom relief. In contrast, this approach has been limited in axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT), a form of thoracic central venous obstruction (TCVO), due to concerns about stent compression by adjacent musculoskeletal structures in the thoracic outlet. This compression risks stent fracture, deformation, malposition, or occlusion. However, recent success of upper extremity and central venous recanalization with dedicated venous stents — engineered to balance flexibility, radial force, and crush resistance — presents an opportunity to reevaluate this application in ASVT.

This report describes the use of dedicated venous stents during recanalization for ASVT, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility, safety, and potential for sustained patency of this novel approach to endovascular stenting across the thoracic outlet.

### Report from the 2013 meeting of the international compression club on advances and challenges of compression therapy [^112T68c2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The International Compression Club, a collaboration of medical experts and industry representatives, was founded in 2005 to develop consensus reports and recommendations regarding the use of compression therapy in the treatment of acute and chronic vascular disease. During the recent meeting of the International Compression Club, member presentations were focused on the clinical application of intermittent pneumatic compression in different disease scenarios as well as on the use of inelastic and short stretch compression therapy. In addition, several new compression devices and systems were introduced by industry representatives. This article summarizes the presentations and subsequent discussions and provides a description of the new compression therapies presented.

### Surgical outcomes for occluded venous thoracic outlet syndrome following transaxillary first rib resection [^116LXFYp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our study provides insights into the outcomes of TFRR concerning the chronicity of complete occlusion in VTOS; however, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, the retrospective design and the single-center nature limit the generalizability of our findings to other clinical settings. Second, most of our patients first received treatment at different facilities before being referred to our center for definitive treatment. This factor introduces variability in the duration and type of anticoagulation, as well as in the locations and practices of pre-TFRR thrombolysis, carried out by various interventionists.

Additionally, our evaluation of symptom severity and symptomatic resolution relied on subjective patient-reported assessment rather than standardized measures such as quality-of-life questionnaires, formal disability scales, or arm circumference measurements, potentially limiting the objectivity of our findings. Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there were some scheduling limitations during this period, contributing to some variability in follow-up imaging. Finally, the absence of a control group of occluded VTOS patients who did not receive TFRR limits our ability to draw robust comparative conclusions. Further multicenter, prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate optimal treatment strategies.

### Outcomes of surgical paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression [^115NdNPc]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by compression of the neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet. These structures include the brachial plexus, the subclavian vein, and the subclavian artery, resulting in neurogenic (NTOS), venous (VTOS), and arterial (ATOS) types of TOS, respectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of paraclavicular surgical decompression for TOS.

- **Methods**: A prospective analysis of patients who underwent surgical decompression for TOS at a newly established center was performed. Diagnosis of TOS was based on clinical history, a physical examination, and additional diagnostic studies. The indication for surgery in patients diagnosed with NTOS was the presence of persistent symptoms following a trial of physical therapy. Primary outcomes were assessed according to Derkash's classification as excellent, good, fair, and poor. Secondary outcomes included mortality, complications, and duration of hospital stay.

- **Results**: Between August 2004 and June 2011, 40 paraclavicular decompression procedures were performed on 36 patients (16 men) with TOS. The mean age was 36.5 years (range: 15–68). Bilateral decompression was performed on 4 patients. The types were NTOS (n = 19; 48%), VTOS (n = 16; 40%), and ATOS (n = 5; 12%). In addition to pain, the most common presenting symptom was numbness in NTOS, swelling in VTOS, and coolness in ATOS. A history of trauma was present in 22.2%. Two patients suffered from residual symptoms after previous transaxillary first rib resection for VTOS.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome caused by first rib hemangioma [^112zsizJ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of first rib hemangioma that caused thoracic outlet syndrome. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a clinical diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. She presented with fullness and easy fatigue of her right arm, accompanied by intermittent engorgement of superficial veins over the shoulder girdle. A chest radiograph revealed enlargement of the anterior aspect of the first rib with fine bony trabeculations. A computed tomography scan showed contrast enhancement over the enlarged rib. Our tentative preoperative diagnosis was a benign first rib hypertrophic change, such as an old fracture with exuberant callus formation.

A right arm venogram revealed a patent subclavian vein with extrinsic compression, which occluded upon arm abduction. Neural conduction studies of both upper extremities were symmetric and normal. Due to the occlusive condition of the subclavian vein on arm abduction and progressive arm weakness in recent months, the patient agreed to surgery. Segmental transection of the offending portion of the enlarged first rib was complicated by difficulty in isolating the whole length of the compressed but normal-appearing subclavian vein due to the initial transaxillary and infraclavicular approaches. The medial aspect of the subclavian vein was obstructed by the enlarged first rib, which extended medially to the junction of the right jugular and subclavian veins. Successful segmental transection of the enlarged first rib was finally accomplished by combined transaxillary and infraclavicular approaches.

### First rib resection in thoracic outlet syndrome [^113bczX4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) present with exercise-induced upper extremity paresthesia. Neurogenic TOS is the most common type, where the brachial nerve plexus is compressed against a tight thoracic outlet. Vascular compromise, although rare, can result from thoracic outlet pressure against the subclavian artery or more commonly the subclavian vein. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TOS and describes several effective surgical interventions. Complete first rib resection with surgical decompression is an essential part of the treatment for TOS. First rib resection via the supraclavicular or a preferred transaxillary route should be considered when conservative modalities provide no symptom improvement.

### Analysis of completion intraoperative venography during first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^112h4XuG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Groups were divided based on venographic outcomes: widely patent (A = groups 1 and 2; n = 33) versus residual stenosis or occlusion (B = groups 3 and 4; n = 18) and compared for outcomes. There was no difference in symptomatic relief (A, 27 of 33; B, 17 of 18; p = 0.40), time free from symptoms (A, 13.4 ± 11.6 months; B, 14.5 ± 14.0 months; p = 0.75), or reintervention (A, 3 of 33; B, 0 of 18; p = 0.54). There were significantly more collaterals identified on completion intraoperative venography in those with residual stenosis/occlusion (A, 3 of 33; B, 9 of 18; p = 0.002).

Additionally, the chronicity of presentation did not affect symptomatic relief (acute, 27 of 33 vs. subacute or chronic, 17 of 18, combined owing to constraints of statistical analysis; p = 0.40) or time free from symptoms (acute, 11.4 ± 10.0 vs. subacute, 15.6 ± 8.0 vs. chronic, 22.3 ± 19.0; p = 0.08).

### Early postoperative hemorrhage after first rib resection for vascular thoracic outlet syndrome [^114Big7Z]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombosis and embolization are the most frequent complications associated with the vascular presentation of thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS). Therefore, surgery for these conditions requires careful balancing of anticoagulation and hemostasis. Our goal is to identify the optimal postoperative anticoagulation management of these patients.

- **Methods**: A prospective database of consecutive patients who have presented to our institution with the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome was reviewed from 1996 through 2010 for instances of postoperative hemorrhage. All venous cases were managed with transaxillary first rib resection followed by postoperative venography and percutaneous angioplasty when required. All arterial cases first underwent thrombolysis, then decompression with transaxillary first and cervical rib resection with concomitant arterial repair when indicated.

- **Results**: Over the study period, 423 patients diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome underwent 551 procedures. Of these, 108 presented with VTOS (12 arterial and 96 venous). The mean age of the patients in the cohort was 33.7 ± 11.5 years, with 53 women and 55 men. Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in four patients (4%): three venous cases and one arterial case. Three patients required tube thoracostomy (average blood return: 800 mL), and two required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for decortication. Age, gender, preoperative anticoagulation, interval from thrombolysis to surgery, operative duration, and operative blood loss had no effect on the risk of bleeding. No hemorrhage occurred in patients.

### Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome [^116p8CJf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of disorders characterized by compression at the thoracic outlet. Three structures are at risk: the brachial plexus, the subclavian vein, and the subclavian artery, which result in neurogenic (NTOS), venous (VTOS), and arterial (ATOS) thoracic outlet syndromes, respectively. Each of these is a separate entity, though they can coexist and possibly overlap.

The treatment of NTOS has been particularly challenging due to a lack of data, which is a result of inconsistent definitions and diagnoses, uncertainty regarding treatment options, and inconsistent outcome measures. The committee has defined NTOS as being present when three of the following four criteria are met: signs and symptoms of pathology at the thoracic outlet (such as pain and/or tenderness), signs and symptoms of nerve compression (distal neurologic changes often worse with arms overhead or dangling), absence of other pathology that could explain the symptoms, and a positive response to a properly performed scalene muscle test injection.

- **Reporting standards for workup, treatment, and assessment**: Standards are presented for all phases of VTOS and ATOS as well. The overall goal is to produce consistency in diagnosis, treatment description, and result assessment, ultimately allowing more valuable data to be presented.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^11176Aa3]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, who underwent upper limb deep venous stenting as an adjunct in the treatment of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS), was performed. All patients between 2012 and 2017 were included. Patient demographics, mode of presentation, presenting symptoms, and vascular risk factors were recorded. Initial patient management and time to definitive treatment from symptoms were identified. Operative data was also recorded. Outcomes included stent patency, re-intervention rates, and change in symptom severity. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.

- **Treatment algorithm**: In the vascular surgery unit at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney, Australia), there is a standardized approach to the management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (PSS). Diagnosis is based on detailed clinical history and duplex ultrasonography. All patients are commenced on a heparin infusion. If the patient has an appropriate risk-benefit profile and symptom onset suggestive of venous thrombosis within two weeks of presentation, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is offered. If there are contraindications for thrombolysis, patients are managed with long-term oral anticoagulation.

Our CDT protocol involves up to 72 hours of urokinase infusion with daily check venograms to assess progress. If a short segment stenosis is recognized during venography during or after successful thrombolysis, this segment is angioplastied to improve the luminal diameter to maintain flow through the major axial vein. The patient is discharged home with oral anticoagulation or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and brought back for elective follow-up.
