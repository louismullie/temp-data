## Question

What are the next steps that should be taken when a patient comes in for malfunctioning right ij thdc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next steps to take when a patient presents with a malfunctioning right internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate assessment and confirmation of dysfunction. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies and prioritize them. Next, I will outline initial bedside interventions, followed by indications for imaging and escalation. After that, I need to detail definitive interventional options, including thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption, and exchange versus revision. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, prevention, and documentation standards, and close with a concise algorithm summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its urgency. Catheter dysfunction is typically defined as failure to maintain prescribed extracorporeal blood flow, often operationalized as less than 300 mL/min with prepump arterial pressure more negative than −250 mmHg, which compromises dialysis adequacy and increases infection risk; I should confirm this at the bedside during or immediately after a dialysis session and document the exact flow and pressures before proceeding [^e0570488] [^54e88932].

> Wait, let me verify the likely etiologies so I don't jump to conclusions. Early dysfunction after placement often reflects malposition or kinking, whereas late dysfunction is commonly due to intraluminal thrombus or a fibrin sheath around the catheter tip; infection can masquerade as poor flow, so I need to check for fever, chills, exit-site erythema, or purulence and correlate with labs before attributing everything to mechanics [^f4734ebe] [^d2a2d65b].

> I will now examine the catheter and patient systematically. I need to check the exit site, tunnel, and surrounding skin for infection; aspirate each lumen to assess ease of withdrawal and pressure; and attempt gentle repositioning or lumen reversal to see if flows improve transiently, which can help distinguish positional issues from thrombotic or sheath-related obstruction; I should also review recent dialysis records for trends in flows and pressures and ask about new symptoms like facial swelling or arm edema that might suggest central venous stenosis [^b05c917b] [^f4734ebe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to imaging just yet. If simple maneuvers restore adequate flow and the catheter has been functioning well, I can defer imaging; but if dysfunction persists or recurs, or if there are signs of malposition or central venous obstruction, I should obtain a chest radiograph to verify tip position and look for kinking, and consider ultrasound of the neck veins if I suspect thrombus or extrinsic compression; if central venous stenosis is suspected, a venogram is the definitive test and will guide next steps [^cf7e14fa] [^f4734ebe].

> Next, I should review initial bedside interventions that are low risk. Let me consider lumen reversal, forceful but careful aspiration and flushing, and gentle repositioning; if these fail, I should proceed to thrombolytic instillation, typically alteplase 2 mg per lumen with a 30–120 minute dwell, which restores function in many cases and is reasonable to repeat if needed, recognizing that median additional survival after each treatment is modest and that repeated dosing is often required [^f4734ebe] [^a3ae62a2].

> But wait, what if thrombolysis fails or the catheter remains dysfunctional despite repeated alteplase? I should confirm the indication for mechanical intervention. Over-the-wire catheter exchange with intentional fibrin sheath disruption is effective and often superior to thrombolysis alone for durable patency; alternatively, fibrin sheath stripping can be performed, though exchange tends to provide longer median catheter survival; I need to ensure sterile technique and consider prophylactic antibiotics if there is concern for infection or during exchange procedures [^97269c1a] [^f4734ebe].

> I need to ensure I choose the right procedural approach. Exchange preserves the existing tunnel and venotomy site and is quicker, but revision with a new tunnel and exit site may reduce infection risk; in a comparative series, revision was associated with significantly fewer infections than exchange, so if infection risk is high or the tunnel is compromised, revision is preferable despite being more invasive [^9ad9ab29].

> Let me consider special scenarios that change management. If there is concurrent exit-site or tunnel infection, I should remove the infected catheter and place a temporary non-tunneled catheter at a different site rather than exchange over the wire, to eradicate the infectious source; if central venous stenosis is present, I should plan endovascular angioplasty or stenting before attempting reinsertion to avoid repeated failure; if the catheter was recently placed and malposition is confirmed, I should reposition or exchange early to correct tip location, ideally at the cavoatrial junction or mid-right atrium depending on catheter design and laterality [^f4734ebe] [^4f38682b] [^cf7e14fa].

> I should double-check prevention and longitudinal strategies so this doesn't recur. Right-sided internal jugular placement with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance reduces malposition and dysfunction; avoiding subclavian veins preserves future AV access options; and for recurrent thrombotic dysfunction, low-dose aspirin may be considered in patients at low bleeding risk, though routine systemic anticoagulation solely for catheter patency is not recommended; standardized definitions and documentation of dysfunction at each session support timely intervention and quality improvement [^aed90534] [^cc7ec67b] [^55f68908].

> Let me reconsider the tip position debate briefly. I initially thought deeper right atrial placement universally improves flow, but wait, newer data with step-tip right internal jugular catheters suggest the SVC may have lower 90-day dysfunction than the cavoatrial junction or deep right atrium, so I should individualize tip position based on catheter design, laterality, and patient anatomy rather than assume deeper is always better [^eae019df] [^cf7e14fa].

> Next, I should review documentation and follow-up. I need to record the exact flow rates, arterial and venous pressures, interventions attempted, and outcomes; if imaging is obtained, I should document tip position and any central venous abnormalities; and I should arrange close follow-up to reassess flows and consider early referral for permanent access planning if the patient remains catheter dependent, because prolonged catheter use drives complications and mortality [^55f68908] [^d6bd0ad0].

> In summary, I should confirm dysfunction objectively, attempt simple bedside fixes, escalate to alteplase if needed, and proceed to exchange or revision with sheath disruption if dysfunction persists; concurrently, I must screen for infection and central venous stenosis, manage them proactively, and adhere to best practices for placement and prevention to preserve future access options and minimize recurrence [^f4734ebe] [^97269c1a] [^aed90534].

For a malfunctioning right internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter, the next steps are to **confirm dysfunction** by checking for inadequate blood flow (< 300 mL/min), high prepump arterial pressure (< −250 mmHg), or inability to complete dialysis [^e0570488], and to **assess for infection** by examining the exit site, tunnel, and obtaining blood cultures if fever or sepsis is suspected [^b05c917b]. Immediate actions include **repositioning or reversing the lumens**, forceful flushing, and low-dose alteplase (2 mg per lumen) if thrombosis is suspected [^f4734ebe] [^a3ae62a2]. If dysfunction persists, obtain a chest X-ray to check for malposition or kinking, and if unresolved, proceed to **catheter exchange over a guidewire** or fibrin sheath disruption [^cf7e14fa] [^97269c1a]. Reserve catheter removal for infection, mechanical failure, or when exchange is not feasible, and plan for permanent access if the catheter is no longer needed [^4f38682b] [^d6bd0ad0].

---

## Clinical assessment and confirmation of dysfunction

- **Confirm dysfunction**: Document inability to achieve ≥ 300 mL/min, prepump arterial pressure < −250 mmHg, or failure to complete dialysis [^e0570488] [^54e88932].

- **Assess for infection**: Inspect the exit site and tunnel for erythema, warmth, swelling, or purulence; obtain blood cultures if fever or sepsis is suspected [^b05c917b].

- **Evaluate for mechanical issues**: Check for kinking, malposition, or catheter migration [^cf7e14fa].

---

## Immediate interventions

- **Repositioning and lumen reversal**: Attempt gentle repositioning or reversing the arterial and venous lumens to improve flow [^f4734ebe].

- **Forceful flushing**: Use saline to clear clots or debris; avoid excessive force to prevent damage [^f4734ebe].

- **Thrombolytic instillation**: Instill alteplase 2 mg per lumen with a 30–120 minute dwell; repeat if needed [^a3ae62a2] [^97269c1a].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Obtain a **chest X-ray** to assess for malposition, kinking, or migration [^cf7e14fa]. If central venous stenosis or occlusion is suspected, proceed to **venography** [^notfound].

---

## Definitive management

- **Catheter exchange over guidewire**: Preferred for persistent dysfunction due to fibrin sheath or thrombus; preserves tunnel and venotomy [^97269c1a].

- **Fibrin sheath disruption**: Consider if exchange alone fails to restore function [^97269c1a].

- **Catheter removal**: Indicated for infection, mechanical failure, or when exchange is not feasible [^4f38682b].

---

## Infection management

Start **empiric antibiotics** if infection is suspected, targeting gram-positive organisms, and remove the infected catheter when feasible [^4f38682b]. For complex infections with central venous stenosis, consider a **staged approach** — infection control, temporary non-tunneled catheter, and endovascular intervention — to preserve access [^4f38682b].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Record the **dysfunction assessment**, interventions, and outcomes [^55f68908]. Arrange **follow-up** to monitor for recurrence and plan permanent access if indicated [^d6bd0ad0].

---

## Stepwise approach

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm dysfunction and assess for infection |
| 2 | Reposition, reverse lumens, flush, thrombolysis |
| 3 | Chest X-ray for malposition |
| 4 | Catheter exchange or fibrin sheath disruption |
| 5 | Remove if infected or failed |
| 6 | Document and plan permanent access |

---

A malfunctioning right internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter requires a **stepwise approach**: confirm dysfunction, attempt immediate fixes, image if needed, and escalate to exchange or removal, with infection control and permanent access planning as indicated [^f4734ebe].

What is the best access?

Once deciding a patient requires RRT, the next step is choosing the best access. The goal is to maximize blood flow rates and minimize complications such as infection and line thrombosis. The KDIGO guidelines recommend preferential placement in the right internal jugular vein, followed by either femoral vein, and lastly the left internal jugular vein. When placing a jugular catheter, the tip of the catheter should ideally be placed in the right atrium, while a femoral catheter should terminate in the inferior vena cava. Subclavian access is discouraged due to the risk of vein stenosis, potentially limiting long-term fistula options if needed. While femoral catheters have been associated with increased infection in the past, recent studies have shown similar rates of catheter infection regardless of site, except in morbidly obese patients. It is critical to use sterile techniques and maximal protective barriers when placing these catheters.

Two major types of catheters are available for RRTs distinguished by the presence of a cuff, if they require tunneling during placement, and optimal duration of use. Most commonly used for RRT initiation is a non-tunneled, non-cuffed dialysis catheter. These are easily placed at the beside under ultrasound guidance by an intensivist. These are considered temporary and should be removed prior to hospital discharge. The alternative, tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheters are placed under fluoroscopic guidance usually by an interventional radiologist or surgeon. Tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheters are associated with decreased risk of infection, greater dialysis efficiency, less treatment interruptions, and overall, less complications. If it is thought that the patient will require dialysis for greater than 2 weeks, has no active bloodstream infections, and no significant coagulopathy, one may consider initial placement of a tunneled catheter.

### Chronic catheter placement [^109004cd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Since the 1997 publication of the Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) vascular access guidelines for cuffed, tunneled catheter placement, additional evidence supporting these recommendations has been published, including additional documentation supporting the right internal jugular vein as the preferred site for insertion. Placing the catheter tip in the right atrium rather than in the superior vena cava will provide adequate blood flow to support effective hemodialysis. The right atrial positioning of the catheter tip will also accommodate catheter tip retraction and decrease the likelihood of malfunction. Overwhelming evidence now supports the use of ultrasound guidance to assist cannulation of the internal jugular vein. This evidence is based on several studies documenting anatomical variations of the internal jugular vein. Ultrasound guidance has significantly decreased the incidence of serious complications of jugular vein cannulation. Finally, a specific technique of catheter placement with variations for catheter types is described.

### Tunneled dialysis catheter: simple, re-do, complicated [^07f91086]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) placement plays an essential role in hemodialysis patients. These catheters are inserted in a significant number of patients prior to establishing permanent dialysis access. Insertion is often simple and straightforward, and the preference is to use the right internal jugular vein due to fewer chances of long-term complications. However, significant obstacles exist including upper body central venous occlusions making catheter insertion complicated. In this report, we describe the technique of TDC insertion in the upper body, known complications from long-term TDC insertion, upper body central venous occlusion as an obstacle for TDC placement as well as the solutions available to mitigate this problem. Additionally, we will review techniques to convert TDC into long-term hemodialysis access.

### Vascular access for continuous renal replacement therapy [^9bb5c8af]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

A working vascular access is essential for performing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) efficiently and without interruption. Dual-lumen temporary hemodialysis catheters are the catheters of choice, although tunneled catheters can also be utilized if therapy is expected to be prolonged. Hemodialysis catheters have to be inserted under ultrasound guidance by trained personnel, using aseptic conditions. The right internal jugular vein is the preferred site. Catheter malfunction and catheter-related infections can be reduced by adhering to preventive guidelines such as ultrasound guidance for placement, strict hand hygiene, gauze dressings, and sterile techniques during catheter handling. Antibiotic or antiseptic-coated catheters and lock solutions may be beneficial in certain patients, but these are not widely used due to the concern for resistant organisms and allergic reactions.

The right internal jugular vein is widely accepted as the vessel of choice for placement of long-term central venous catheters for hemodialysis. As vascular access sites become progressively depleted, alternate anatomic locations for access must be sought. We describe a non-surgical (fluoroscopy assisted, percutaneous) technique for placement of external jugular, tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheters, and provide long-term blood flow and dialysis adequacy data for EJV catheters.

### Insertion of tunneled hemodialysis catheters without fluoroscopy [^abb71543]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) is used as a bridge access for hemodialysis. Few prospective studies have been designed to evaluate conversion from non-tunneled to TCC without the use of fluoroscopy when performed by nephrologists.

Methods

We performed an observational prospective cohort in incident patients receiving hemodialysis through a non-tunneled right jugular vein catheter.

Results

130 procedures were performed in 122 patients (51 ± 18 years). The success rate was 100%. There was a total of 26,546 catheter days. Ninety-one of the 130 catheters were removed during the study period. Life table analysis revealed primary patency rates of 92%, 82%, and 68% at 30, 60, and 120 days, respectively. Infection requiring catheter removal occurred at a frequency of 0.09 per 100 catheter days. Catheter malfunction requiring intervention occurred at a rate of 0.03 per 100 catheter days. Hypertension and duration of existing non-tunneled catheter of less than 2 weeks were independently associated with better TCC survival.

Conclusion

The conversion from non-tunneled to TCC performed by nephrologists and without fluoroscopy may be safe by using the internal right jugular vein. The ideal time to do this procedure is within less than 2 weeks of existing non-tunneled catheter.

### Tunneled central venous catheter exchange: techniques to improve prevention of air embolism [^56b5c806]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2015). Low credibility.

Malfunctioning tunneled hemodialysis central venous catheters (CVCs), because of thrombotic or infectious complications, are frequently exchanged. During the CVC exchanging procedure, there are several possible technical complications, as in first insertion, including air embolism. Prevention remains the key to the management of air embolism. Herein, we emphasize the technical tricks capable of reducing the risk of air embolism in long-term CVC exchange. In particular, adoption of a 5 to 10 degrees Trendelenburg position, direct puncture of the previous CVC venous lumen for guide-wire insertion, as opposed to guide-wire introduction after cutting the CVC, a light manual compression of the internal jugular vein venotomy site after catheter removal. The Valsalva maneuvre in collaborating patients, valved introducers, and correction of hypovolemia are also useful precautions. Principles of air embolism diagnosis and treatment are also outlined in the article.

The internal jugular vein is most commonly used for catheter insertion, since it has long been known that both insertion complications and central venous stenosis are increased with the infra-clavicular subclavian/ axillary vein) route: for example, in a study of patients with malfunction of established fistulas, prior subclavian vein catheter use was more common in those with subclavian vein stenosis (11/12, 92%) than those with no stenosis (12/35, 34%). And in a pre-operative venogram study prior to access formation, subclavian vein stenosis was seen in (14/35, 40%) of those with, but none of the 27 without, a current or prior subclavian catheter. A comparative study of 100 patients dialysed either by a subclavian or internal jugular catheter (50 in each group) found stenosis of the subclavian or brachiocephalic vein in 42% of the subclavian catheter group, compared to 10% of the internal jugular group. And a similar study found stenosis in 16/32 (50%) of patients after temporary subclavian catheters versus none of the 20 patients with prior temporary internal jugular catheter. These early studies with both temporary and tunnelled catheters highlight the increased risk of stenosis when using the subclavian vein route, which should therefore be avoided where possible, in particular in children and younger adults, for whom a long term outlook is crucial.

Also, the right sided internal jugular is preferred since the longer and more angulated route from the left internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava, results in a higher risk of catheter malposition, and shorter patency. In a retrospective review of 532 catheters, left-sided catheters were associated with more catheter replacements due to infection or poor flow. However, other factors may reasonably contribute to the choice of catheter location. The longevity of planned or current AV access may be reduced by catheter placement on the same side, and it seems logical to avoid the site of pacemakers or other trans-venous devices, though studies have shown that this can be successful in selected cases. It is not clear which of these concerns should take priority, and vessel ultrasound, clinical judgement and patient preference also need consideration.

### Investigation of risk factors for tunneled hemodialysis catheters dysfunction: competing risk analysis of a tertiary center data [^9353cedb]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous research about the variables influencing the complications of the tunneled central venous catheters occurred in hemodialysis patients is shown that the Localization of the catheter into the right internal jugular vein, duration of catheterization and diabetes increase the risk of infection and also younger hemodialysis patients have a higher risk of infection. However, the use of anticoagulant agents decreases the risk of thrombosis but is not significant. Since there is a little knowledge about the variables that effect on the time until common complications of CVCs occurs, this study aims to find the effect of several risk factors on the time until thrombosis and infections of the catheter in hemodialysis patients. A better understanding of these factors may lead to having better survival and lower complication in the CVCs.

### Concomitant placement of dialysis and infusion catheters in the right internal jugular vein in the intensive care setting: is it safe? [^3fc778ca]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study examined the safety and efficacy of placing both a central venous dialysis catheter and a central venous catheter for infusion in the right internal jugular vein compared to only a central venous dialysis catheter.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review for all adult patients who underwent the placement of the right internal jugular dialysis catheter by a single surgeon. Patients were grouped based on whether they received a tunneled dual lumen dialysis catheter alone or in combination with a central venous infusion catheter in the right internal jugular vein. Catheter-related thrombosis, line infections, line malfunctions, pneumothorax, and need for line replacement were evaluated.

Results

There were 97 patients in the dialysis catheter and central venous infusion line group and 63 patients in the dialysis catheter only group. The two groups were not different with regard to age (62.1 ± 16.3years vs 57.9 ± 17.6years) and gender (47.4% male vs 55.6% male). No significant differences were found in the incidence of thrombosis (1.0% vs 0.0%, p > 0.999), line infection (2.1% vs 0.0%, p = 0.519), or line malfunctions (2.1% vs 0.0%, p = 0.516) in patients who did or did not have a central venous infusion catheter placed concomitantly with the dialysis catheter, respectively. No patients in either group had a pneumothorax.

Conclusions

Although not currently utilized with frequency, these preliminary data indicate that placing both a dual lumen dialysis catheter and central venous infusion catheter in the right internal jugular simultaneously could be a viable option.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^42835f90]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Internal jugular and femoral central venous catheterization — operators and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of persistent left superior vena cava anomalies when choosing the internal jugular veins. In select patients and limited circumstances, tunneled cuffed femoral vein catheterization may be reasonable; for urgent starts where patients are not transplant candidates and rapid access creation/insertion is feasible (ie, within 1 month), a tunneled cuffed femoral central venous catheter (CVC) may preserve central veins and reinforce that CVC use is only temporary. This strategy is effective only if the facility can coordinate rapid arteriovenous graft (AVG) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation for hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion, and randomized trials and reviews have demonstrated equivalent or superior outcomes regarding CVC thrombosis and infection using tunneled femoral vein CVC; however, precaution with femoral CVC use must be taken.

### Does heparin coating improve patency or reduce infection of tunneled dialysis catheters? [^17cf9406]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Tunneled dialysis catheters are prone to frequent malfunction and infection. Catheter thrombosis occurs despite prophylactic anticoagulant locks. Catheter thrombi may also serve as a nidus for catheter infection, thereby increasing the risk of bacteremia. Thus, heparin coating of catheters may reduce thrombosis and infection. This study evaluated whether heparin-coated hemodialysis catheters have fewer infections or greater cumulative survival than noncoated catheters.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We retrospectively queried a prospective access database to analyze the outcomes of 175 tunneled dialysis catheters placed in the internal jugular vein, including 89 heparin-coated catheters and 86 noncoated catheters. The primary outcome was cumulative catheter survival, and the secondary outcome was infection-free catheter survival.

Results

The two patient groups were similar in demographics and clinical and catheter features. Catheter-related bacteremia occurred less frequently with heparin-coated catheters than with noncoated catheters (34 versus 60%, P < 0.001). Cumulative catheter survival was similar in heparin-coated and noncoated catheters (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.36; P = 0.53). On multiple variable survival analysis including catheter type, age, sex, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, catheter location, and previous catheter, only catheter location predicted cumulative catheter survival (hazard ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.25, with the right internal jugular location being the reference group, P = 0.003). The frequency of thrombolytic instillation was 1.8 per 1000 catheter-days in both groups.

Conclusions

Heparin coating decreases the frequency of catheter-related bacteremia but does not reduce the frequency of catheter malfunction.

Next, a guidewire was reintroduced through the right femoral vein sheath. With catheter-wire synergy, the guidewire traversed the SVC stent and right brachiocephalic vein to reach the right subclavian vein (Figure 2 I). A 10 mm × 6 cm balloon catheter was advanced over the wire to dilate the right brachiocephalic vein (Figure 3 A, B). Under DSA guidance, the balloon within the dilated brachiocephalic vein was punctured (Figure 3 C), and a guidewire was successfully advanced to the inferior vena cava. Finally, a new TCC was inserted (Figure 3 D, E).

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^4f38682b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

TCC related infections remain a significant clinical challenge. This study analyzed two cases of complex TCC tunnel infections complicated by concurrent bloodstream infections and CVS. By comparing the outcomes of different therapeutic approaches, we propose a staged management protocol comprising infection control, temporary transition to a NCC, and endovascular intervention. This protocol offers a novel strategy for managing complex TCC infections. Compared to simple TCC removal, our approach demonstrates distinct advantages in preventing CVS progression or occlusion and improving reinsertion success rates, thereby preserving vascular access resources and reducing procedural risks.

Challenges in managing complex TCC infections

Current guidelines, including those from KDOQI, recommend removal of infected TCC to eliminate the source of infection in complex cases. While effective for infection control, this approach risks exacerbating CVS or even causing occlusion, significantly complicating subsequent TCC reinsertion. In Case 1, after TCC removal, occlusion of the right internal jugular vein, brachiocephalic vein, and in-stent stenosis at both ends of the SVC rendered reinsertion highly challenging. Studies indicate that the incidence of CVS or central venous occlusion progressively increases with prolonged TCC indwelling time, reaching 28% beyond 9 months. This underscores the clinical dilemma: indiscriminate TCC removal in patients with long-term catheter use and complex infections may precipitate severe vascular complications, increasing the technical difficulty of reinsertion.

Advantages of the staged management protocol

The proposed staged protocol — integrating infection control, temporary NCC transition, and endovascular intervention — addresses the limitations of immediate TCC removal. By removing the infected TCC while preserving vascular access through in-situ NCC placement, this strategy achieves dual objectives: eliminating the infectious focus and maintaining dialysis continuity. Following infection resolution, NCC-to-TCC exchange is performed. For CVS or occlusion, endovascular techniques (e.g. balloon angioplasty or stenting) enable precise revascularization, minimizing open surgical trauma and complications. In Case 2, this approach not only eradicated infection but also facilitated subsequent TCC reinsertion by preserving venous access integrity, demonstrating marked superiority in reducing procedural complexity. It is worth noting that other alternative approaches have also been reported in the literature. For instance, Papadoulas et al. described the successful use of the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) graft in a patient with central venous stenosis and a history of recurrent tunneled dialysis catheter infections. The implementation of the HeRO graft led to the elimination of infections and provided a reliable vascular access option for the patient.

### Ipsilateral vocal fold paralysis: an unusual complication of internal jugular tunnelled dialysis catheter insertion [^778740ef]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters are extensively used in critical care units and in dialysis centres to gain access to the blood stream for the purpose of invasive monitoring, drug administration, parenteral nutrition and to perform renal replacement therapy. One of the common areas of central venous catheter insertion is right internal jugular vein due to its anatomical continuity with the superior vena cava. The complication rates of central venous catheter insertion can be more than 15%, including early and late complications.

Case Report

We present an unusual complication of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, leading to right vocal fold paralysis, following insertion of a right internal jugular tunnelled dialysis catheter. The vocal fold paralysis improved over next 8months with conservative management alone.

Conclusion

This case illustrates an unusual complication of central venous catheter insertion and the importance of recognizing the possibility of such complications, to prevent them from happening and also to manage them appropriately.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^aed90534]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Central venous catheter (CVC) site selection by ESKD Life-Plan — KDOQI considers it reasonable to select the CVC location after careful consideration of the patient's ESKD Life-Plan, prioritizing upper extremity before lower extremity when choices are equivalent. For valid CVC use with expected limited duration (eg, < 3 months), consider preferential use of a tunneled cuffed CVC in the opposite extremity to anticipated AV access, and when transplant is anticipated, consider a tunneled cuffed right internal jugular catheter. Some experts support that for urgent dialysis starts under limited use circumstances (eg, < 1 month) when transplant is not an option, a tunneled, cuffed femoral CVC is acceptable until AV access or a peritoneal dialysis catheter can be created, with contraindications including morbid obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m^2). When valid CVC use is expected to be prolonged (eg, > 3 months) without anticipated AV access, locations in order of preference are internal jugular, external jugular, femoral, subclavian, and lumbar; right-sided insertion is preferable to the left side in the absence of contraindications, and the side needed for AV access creation should be preserved.

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^a935ff55]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 71-year-old female presented on March 20, 2023, with a 2-day history of chills and fever during hemodialysis via a right internal jugular vein TCC that had been in place for 5 years. The patient was diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetic nephropathy in July 2018. In August 2018, a 14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter (Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA) was implanted in the right internal jugular vein to initiate regular hemodialysis. The patient was admitted for treatment due to a catheter tunnel abscess and CRBSI.

On admission, physical examination revealed a 6 cm × 5 cm abscess at the TCC tunnel site in the right internal jugular vein, characterized by localized erythema, warmth, tenderness, and fluctuance (Figure 4 A). Based on clinical history and examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, CRBSI, and TCC tunnel infection.CTA identified stenosis of the SVC (Figure 4 C, D).

Given the risk of exacerbating SVC stenosis or occlusion with TCC removal (as observed in the prior case), which could complicate future catheter reinsertion, a modified strategy was employed. Since the tunnel infection spared the venous entry site, the infected TCC was removed and replaced in situ with a NCC over a guidewire to preserve access(Figure 4 B). The procedural steps were as follows:

Sterilization and draping of the TCC entry site. Catheter separation and guidewire insertion: The TCC was dissected at the venous entry, and a guidewire was advanced through the existing intravascular lumen.TCC removal and NCC placement: The indwelling TCC segment was extracted, and an NCC was inserted over the guidewire.

Cuff dissection and debridement: The TCC cuff was excised, and the abscess cavity was surgically debrided. Microbiological cultures of peripheral blood, catheter blood, catheter tip, and pus all isolated Staphylococcus aureus as the causative pathogen. Following infection control, the NCC was later exchanged for a new TCC.

### Outcomes of tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters: an experience from a tertiary care center in karachi, Pakistan [^fb975b40]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCC) are generally used as a temporary means to provide hemodialysis (HD) until permanent arteriovenous access is established. However, certain complications are associated with use of TCCs such as infections, catheter malfunction/malposition or venous stenosis. Limited data is available on outcomes and long term complications associated with TCCs in our country. The aim of this study was to study the outcomes of TCCs and associated long term complications during the course of its usage.

Methods

We retrospectively studied case records of patients who had TCCs placed for HD at our institution, from January 2016 to June 2018.

Results

A total of 116 TCCs were placed during the study period. The mean age of the population was 57.09years; 58.6% were males. The right internal jugular vein (52.6%) was the most common site of TCC insertion followed by the left internal jugular vein (29.3%). Functioning TCCs were successfully removed in almost two-thirds of cases (65.7%) once their permanent access was mature. Development of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was seen in 22 patients (19.8%) requiring catheter removal in 14 (12.6%) patients. Mechanical complications leading to catheter removal were seen in seven patients (6.3%). The median catheter duration was 62.5days ranging from 1 to 343days.

Conclusion

TCCs, though associated with complications particularly CRBSI, are a viable option for short- to intermediate-term use for HD till the maturation of permanent arteriovenous access in a limited-resource setting.

KDIGO AKI — Dialysis catheter type, site, and insertion practices: We suggest initiating RRT in patients with AKI via an uncuffed nontunneled dialysis catheter, rather than a tunneled catheter (2D). When choosing a vein for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, consider these preferences (Not Graded): First choice: right jugular vein; Second choice: femoral vein; Third choice: left jugular vein; Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the dominant side. We recommend using ultrasound guidance for dialysis catheter insertion (1A). We recommend obtaining a chest radiograph promptly after placement and before first use of an internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheter (1B). We suggest not using topical antibiotics over the skin insertion site of a nontunneled dialysis catheter in ICU (intensive care unit) patients with AKI requiring RRT (2C), and we suggest not using antibiotic locks for prevention of catheter-related infections of nontunneled dialysis catheters in AKI requiring RRT (2C).

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^63d77b6c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 3 — central venous catheter (CVC) locations: KDOQI considers it reasonable to choose the site (location) of the CVC after careful consideration of the patient's end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) Life-Plan. When there are valid reasons for CVC use and duration of use is expected to be limited (eg, < 3 months), if arteriovenous (AV) access is likely to be ready for use in the near future, consider preferential use of a tunneled cuffed CVC in the opposite extremity to the anticipated AV access. Some experts support that in urgent dialysis start situations, under limited use circumstances (eg, < 1 month) and transplant is not an option, use of a tunneled, cuffed femoral CVC is acceptable (unless contraindicated) until the AV access or peritoneal dialysis catheter can be quickly created and used; contraindications to femoral vein CVC include hygienic reasons and morbid obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2). When there are valid reasons for CVC use and duration of use is expected to be prolonged (eg, > 3 months) without anticipated use of AV access, locations in order of preference are internal jugular, external jugular, femoral, subclavian, and lumbar; in the absence of contraindications, right-sided insertion is preferable due to more direct anatomy, and if one side has pathology that limits AV access creation but allows CVC insertion, that side should be used to preserve the other side for AV access creation.

### Malfunction of dialysis catheters: management of fibrin sheath and related problems [^14e4f577]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Suitable central venous access for hemodialysis is frequently required in patients with end-stage renal disease, whenever an arteriovenous fistula or peritoneal dialysis fails or is not a possibility. Ultimately, long-term dialysis via central access may result in dysfunctional catheter with problems such as malpositioning of catheter tip, fibrin sheath formation, thrombosis, infection, and bleeding. The role of interventional radiology is to deliver appropriate treatment to maintain patent and functional access, while minimizing the risk of venous occlusive disease. This article aims at describing different techniques and approaches for management of fibrin sheath associated with malfunctioning tunneled dialysis catheters, as well as to provide scientific evidence from the current literature.

### Long-term durability of tunneled hemodialysis catheters: outcomes from a single institution 22-year experience [^01e897b7]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

272 tunneled hemodialysis catheters in 229 patients with dwell times of greater than 1 year were identified. Of these, 240 were Ash Split and 32 were Arrow-Clark VectorFlow. For these catheters, the shortest dwell time was 366 days, and the longest was 3,802 days (median 504 days, mean 598 days). The data cover a total of 162,439 catheter days. Overall, the rate of complications requiring removal or exchange was 1.67 per 1,000 catheter days.

Most catheters were removed or exchanged because they were no longer needed, were infected, or had poor flow. 92 catheters (33.8%) were no longer needed because of maturation of arteriovenous access, 88 (32.4%) were removed due to infection, and 64 (23.5%) had poor flow. A complete list of complications can be found in Table 2.

Catheters were placed in the following access veins: right internal jugular (RIJ), right external jugular (REJ), left internal jugular (LIJ), left external jugular (LEJ), collateral veins, right femoral, and left femoral. Most catheters were placed in the RIJ (197, 72.4%) and LIJ (56, 20.6%). A complete list of catheter placements by access vein can be found in Table 3.

Catheter Placement by Access Vein

Of the 272 catheters, 157 were placed de novo (57.7%) and 113 (41.5%) were exchanged over guidewires. 2 (0.7%) catheters were placed after tract recanalization.

Catheters and port catheter systems — site selection and imaging: The preferred insertion site for tunneled cuffed venous dialysis catheters or port catheter systems is the right internal jugular vein, with subclavian access used only when no other upper-extremity or chest-wall options are available (A). Other options include the right external jugular vein, left internal and external jugular veins, subclavian veins, femoral veins, and translumbar and transhepatic access to the IVC, and ultrasound should be used in the placement of catheters (B); the position of the tip of any central catheter should be verified radiologically (B).

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: an unusual complication of an internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter [^5aa94eb6]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome due to the tip of an internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter malposition in inferior vena cava or hepatic vein is a rare complication. We aimed to present our experience and compare it with the previous reports to highlight the clinical features and the optimal management. A 57-year-old female with history of ANCAp vasculitis, treated by hemodialysis in the last 2years on a right internal jugular vein tunneled catheter was admitted for pain in the right upper quadrant. A subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome due to catheter malposition was diagnosed. The catheter was removed, and a new tunneled hemodialysis line was inserted in the right internal jugular vein with the tip at the junction of right atrium with superior vena cava. Anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5mg twice daily was started after catheter replacement and the patient was discharged. At 1month follow-up the patient had no symptoms, and the ultrasound revealed the absence of the thrombus in the inferior vena cava. Imagining monitoring for malposition after insertion or in a clinical context suggestive for Budd-Chiari syndrome is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In our case, anticoagulation with apixaban and prompt catheter replacement resulted in Budd-Chiari syndrome resolution.

### Catheter management in hemodialysis patients: delivering adequate flow [^0c8e3812]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Over 330,000 individuals in the United States depend on hemodialysis (HD), the majority as a result of end-stage renal disease. Sustainable vascular access can be achieved through arteriovenous fistulas, arteriovenous grafts, or tunneled catheters. Tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs) often remain in use for months or even years, long beyond their initial intended use as a bridging device. Research efforts are focused on identifying strategies to prevent/minimize the risk of the most common catheter-related complications: thrombotic occlusion and infection. Thrombotic occlusion of TDCs prevents adequate dialysis but can be managed successfully through thrombolytic agents to restore/improve blood flow in the majority of patients, allowing immediate HD delivery and prolonging usability of the TDC. Occasionally, catheter exchange with fibrin sheath disruption is needed to preserve the site. Surface-treated catheters could improve the morbidity and mortality associated with HD delivery via an indwelling catheter, but results from studies have been disappointing to date. We review the etiology of catheter-based access failure and the monitoring and interventional steps that should be taken to maintain the patency and safety of catheters for HD. Wherever possible we note the areas in which there is scant data where further randomized clinical trials are needed.

Hemodialysis catheter (HDC) using a tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) is a viable option for acute hemodialysis. Vessel injury during catheter insertion can lead to malpositioning of the HDC into the mediastinum. We herewith present two malpositioned HDCs in various clinical settings. For the first case, the HDC was inserted without fluoroscopic guidance, but in the second case, the HDC was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance. Our first case involved HDC insertion via the right internal jugular vein (IJV), and the second case involved HDC insertion via the left IJV. We clinically suspected HDC malposition because of poor aspiration, despite good infusion via the two lumens. Chest radiography, computed tomography, and venography showed various abnormal positions of the HDC. Our case report provides additional information about malpositioned or malfunctioning HDCs in various clinical settings.

KDOQI guideline 21 — catheter dysfunction — considers it reasonable to assess for CVC dysfunction during each hemodialysis (HD) session using the updated definition of CVC dysfunction as failure to maintain the prescribed extracorporeal blood flow required for adequate hemodialysis without lengthening the prescribed HD treatment (Expert Opinion). The rationale notes that cuffed, tunneled, dual-lumen CVCs are an acceptable HD access when an arteriovenous (AV) access is not suitable or available despite high complication rates and mortality risk, and that CVC dysfunction is associated with reduced dialysis adequacy, increased risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and mortality.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^f97026a1]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) dialysis catheter site selection prioritization states that the subclavian vein is "the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI" and, because "the subclavian vein should be avoided", the remaining options are the jugular and femoral veins. In a randomized multicenter trial of 750 AKI patients comparing first renal replacement therapy (RRT) catheter placement, mean duration was 6.2 days (femoral) versus 6.9 days (jugular), bloodstream infection did not differ at 2.3 per 1000 catheter-days (jugular) versus 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days (femoral), and 20% of catheters were antiseptic-impregnated. Observational data indicate more malfunctioning and shorter actuarial survival for femoral than jugular catheters, more malfunction with left-sided versus right-sided jugular catheters, and recirculation more frequent in femoral than subclavian or jugular catheters, especially with shorter femoral catheters; therefore, "Femoral catheters are preferred over left jugular catheters because of more frequent malfunction, and the subclavian vein should only be considered a rescue option". For transplant candidates, patients "should not have a femoral catheter placed" and catheter insertion should follow infection-control policies with "maximal sterile barrier precautions" and "chlorhexidine 2% skin antisepsis". Overall, "there are no clear data to support a strong preference between the femoral and jugular insertion site in the general AKI population for insertion of a dialysis catheter".

### Management of some uncommon but significant complications of the tunneled cuffed catheter for hemodialysis [^598a2581]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Although use of the autogenous arteriovenous fistula is the first choice for vascular access for hemodialysis, the tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) remains an important alternative method that is applied widely in maintenance hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. In addition to common complications, such as thrombosis, infection, formation of a fibrin sheath, or central vein stenosis, TCC dysfunction, such as kinks, cuff detachment, or mechanical destruction, can be easily overlooked. The reasons for these clinical problems are multifactorial and include the insertion handling, presence of diabetes mellitus, catheter type, malnutrition, and the patient's body habitus. This minireview describes our experience with TCC and the current literature on managing TCC dysfunction.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^54e88932]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Central venous catheter (CVC) dysfunction — definition and epidemiology — includes high use and a functional threshold: CVCs are used in 80% of all incident hemodialysis (HD) patients, and intervention is often required in 20% to 40% of patients dialyzing with a CVC; CVC dysfunction was defined as failure to attain and maintain an extracorporeal blood flow of 300 mL/min or greater at a prepump arterial pressure more negative than -250 mm Hg. Malposition contributes as CVCs can migrate spontaneously, most commonly in the contralateral innominate vein, with dysfunction due to direct contact of the CVC tip or side holes with the vessel wall causing obstruction of blood flow; a left internal jugular approach can induce thrombus formation because of the 90° turn into the SVC, and if malposition is found within the first week of placement it should be exchanged for one of proper size/ length, while dysfunction generally emerges during the first HD session and can be resolved by repositioning if poor position is the culprit.

### Acute dialysis catheters [^973d9725]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Acute dialysis catheters are non-cuffed, non-tunnelled catheters used for immediate vascular access. They are primarily used for acute renal failure in bed-bound patients and for short-term use in patients with malfunction of permanent access. Long-term use of acute catheters is not recommended, but does occur with acceptable infection rates in dialysis centers where tunnelled, cuffed catheters are not available. Most acute catheters are made of polyurethane, but silicone catheters are now available with larger lumen sizes capable of delivering blood flow rates over 300 ml/min. Acute catheters should be inserted in the internal jugular or femoral vein under ultrasound guidance to minimize complications. Subclavian catheters cause stenosis, thrombosis, and perforation of vessels. Intermittent catheter malfunction still occurs, particularly for left-sided internal jugular catheters and catheters placed in women. Blood flow may improve with lumen reversal, intraluminal t-PA, or guidewire exchange. Limiting duration of use and dressing catheter exit sites with dry gauze and antiseptic ointments can prevent catheter-related infections.

### Different management methods for tunnel abscess in tunneled cuffed catheters with catheter-related bloodstream infections and central venous stenosis: two case reports [^eb163d08]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCCs) are critical vascular access tools for hemodialysis patients, but they are associated with complications such as tunnel infections (TIs) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Current guidelines recommend removing infected TCCs, but this can exacerbate central venous stenosis (CVS) and complicate subsequent catheter reinsertion. This case series proposes a staged management protocol for complex TCC tunnel abscess infections complicated by CVS.

Case presentation

We present two cases of complex TCC tunnel abscess infections with concurrent CVS. In case 1, a 67-year-old female with ANCA-associated vasculitis had a TCC tunnel abscess and CRBSI. After TCC removal, CT angiography(CTA) revealed occlusion of the right internal jugular vein and right brachiocephalic vein, along with in-stent stenosis of the superior vena cava. Endovascular interventions, including balloon angioplasty, facilitated successful TCC reinsertion. In case 2, a 71-year-old female with diabetic nephropathy underwent a staged strategy: the infected TCC was removed and replaced with a non-cuffed catheter (NCC) in situ. After infection control, balloon angioplasty resolved CVS, and a new TCC was reinserted. Both patients achieved infection control and preserved functional vascular access.

Conclusions

Both patients achieved infection control and preserved functional vascular access. However, Case 1 required technically demanding multistep endovascular procedures with elevated procedural risks, while Case 2 simplified reinsertion through NCC bridging. A staged management protocol (infection control → NCC transition → endovascular salvage) effectively addresses complex TCC infections with concurrent CVS, mitigates post-removal vascular injury, and enhances reinsertion success. Larger cohort studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and long-term safety of this approach.

Tunneled cuffed venous catheter placement — use sites and avoidance include placing in an area where ultrasound guidance and fluoroscopy are available, preferring the right internal jugular vein, which offers a more direct route to the right atrium and is associated with a lower risk of complications and fewer placement complications than other sites, avoiding the left internal jugular when possible given poorer BFRs and greater rates of stenosis and thrombosis, recognizing that femoral and translumbar vein placement are associated with the greatest infection rates compared with other sites, not placing catheters in the subclavian vessels on either side because of the risk for stenosis that can permanently exclude upper-extremity permanent fistula or graft, not placing catheters on the same side as a slowly maturing permanent access, and noting catheter-induced central vein stenosis is related to site of insertion, number and duration of catheter uses, and occurrence of infection.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^6cf8222a]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Providing RRT

Although the timing of RRT initiation is controversial, the provision of RRT itself has become fairly well established. Patients with AKI requiring RRT have an evolving clinical status and should be supported by the appropriate and available modality. Modality choice should also be tailored to patient clinical status. As suggested in the 2012 KDIGO guideline, in hemodynamically unstable patients, continuous RRT, rather than intermittent hemodialysis, is more physiologically appropriate, but RCTs have not demonstrated better outcomes with continuous RRT. Both continuous and intermittent RRT can lead to changes in intracranial pressure, but the risk is higher with intermittent RRT. Selection of modalities should be considered in the context of available resources and expertise of personnel.

An uncuffed non-tunnelled dialysis catheter of appropriate length and gauge should be used to initiate RRT in AKI patients. In patients with expected prolonged indication for RRT, a cuffed catheter can be considered. The first choice for site is the right jugular vein or femoral vein, although the femoral site is inferior in patients with increased body mass. The next choices would be left jugular vein followed by subclavian vein. Anticoagulation type should be selected based on local resources and expertise of personnel. The recommendation from 2012 to use regional citrate anticoagulation for continuous RRT in patients who do not have a contraindication remains supported by existing data. – Delivery of RRT must reach the goals of electrolyte, acid–base, solute, and fluid balance for each specific patient. When using intermittent or extended RRT, a Kt/V of at least 1.2 per treatment 3 times a week should be delivered. For peritoneal dialysis, future studies should focus on dosing in AKI, although currently we suggest a dose of 0.3 Kt/V per session. An effluent volume of 20–25 ml/kg per h should be delivered when continuous RRT is used. This will sometimes require a higher prescription of effluent volume. The rate of fluid removal for a given patient with fluid overload is controversial, and more research is needed. Methods to better assess fluid management goals during RRT would also be valuable. Finally, RRT should be discontinued when kidney function has recovered or when RRT becomes inconsistent with shared care goals. Modality transition from continuous RRT to intermittent hemodialysis in intensive care unit patients should be considered when vasopressor support has been stopped, intracranial hypertension has resolved, and positive fluid balance can be controlled by intermittent hemodialysis.

### Retrospective review of the development and implementation of a bedside tunneled dialysis catheter program [^13b02de3]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to place a subcutaneously tunneled catheter is an infection prevention strategy for long term venous access allowing the proceduralist to access a vein and relocate the catheter exit site to a region on the body where care and maintenance can be safely performed. Subcutaneously tunneled centrally inserted dialysis catheter (ST-CIDC) placement is commonly performed in patients with renal disease and is traditionally performed with fluoroscopy in the interventional radiology suite or the operating theater. However, today's interventional radiologists and surgeons perform advanced invasive procedures that can be time-consuming resulting in delays in the scheduling of elective tunneled catheter placements.

Methods

In this retrospective case series, we present data from a quality improvement initiative aimed at integrating available evidence for bedside tunneled dialysis catheter placement with electrocardiograph (ECG) tip positioning, to expedite care, improve patient safety outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs associated with the procedure.

Results

Most patients in the study had end-stage renal disease (59%) or acute kidney injury (37%) and were receiving placement for the first time (91%). The right jugular vein was cannulated in 84% of the placements and rates of post-insertion complications were < 1%, regardless of the vessel cannulated. Performing bedside tunneled dialysis catheter placement resulted in a cost savings of $385,938.76 over a 2-year period.

Conclusions

The placement of ultrasound guided tunneled dialysis catheters at the bedside following a pre-procedural evaluation of the right jugular, brachiocephalic, and femoral veins is a safe option resulting in expedited patient care, decreased resource utilization, and significant cost savings. Non-bedside techniques performed in interventional radiology, or the operating room should remain a consideration for patients requiring left sided venous access, signs of central stenosis, a history of multiple tunneled catheters, or patients requiring moderate sedation outside of the ICU.

### Tunneled internal jugular hemodialysis catheters: impact of laterality and tip position on catheter dysfunction and infection rates [^0c9f04d6]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine rates of dysfunction and infection for tunneled internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheters based on laterality of insertion and catheter tip position.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of a procedural database for tunneled internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter placements between January 2008 and December 2009 revealed 532 catheter insertions in 409 patients (234 male; mean age, 54.9 y). Of these, 398 catheters were placed on the right and 134 on the left. The catheter tip location was categorized as superior vena cava (SVC), pericavoatrial junction, or mid- to deep right atrium based on review of the final intraprocedural radiograph. The rates of catheter dysfunction and catheter-related infection (reported as events per 100 catheter-days) were analyzed.

Results

Catheters terminating in the SVC or pericavoatrial junction inserted from the left showed significantly higher rates of infection (0.50 vs 0.27; P = 0.005) and dysfunction (0.25 vs 0.11; P = 0.036) compared with those inserted from the right. No difference was identified based on laterality for catheter tip position in the mid- to deep right atrium. Left-sided catheters terminating in the SVC or pericavoatrial junction had significantly more episodes of catheter dysfunction or infection than catheters terminating in the mid- to deep right atrium (0.84 vs 0.35; P = 0.006), whereas no significant difference was identified for right-sided catheters based on tip position.

Conclusions

When inserted from the left internal jugular vein, catheter tip position demonstrated a significant impact on catheter-related dysfunction and infection; this relationship was not demonstrated for right-sided catheters.

Discussion

In this retrospective study, less prolonged levels of PT and slightly prolonged aPTT were identified as risk factors for catheter dysfunction during the first 48 h after initiation of CRRT. In terms of requirement of re-catheterization to maintain CRRT, venous access site was associated with the increased risk of re-catheterization. Initial catheterization in the left jugular vein or femoral vein as venous access sites were more likely to require re-catheterization compared to the right internal jugular vein.

Previous studies of risk factors associated with catheter dysfunction during RRT have focused on the vascular access site with conflicting reports with respect to relative risk of dysfunction between catheters in the femoral and the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein had been considered as the optimal site of vascular access for RRT with lower incidence of catheter dysfunction and risk of catheter-related infection. However, since the CATHEDIA study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis or CRRT, there have been reports of similar risk of infection, catheter dysfunction, and dialysis performance between femoral and right jugular vein catheterization. Recent guidelines recommend both femoral and right jugular veins as the initial site for vascular access in the setting of critical care, while discouraging the use of left jugular and subclavian veins. In clinical practice, femoral vein is preferred for CRRT especially for sicker and lighter patients, as it enables faster and more successful vascular access.

Type, length, and the location of tip of catheter have also been shown to be associated with the risk of catheter dysfunction. The non-tunneled, non-cuffed temporary catheter is recommended for critically ill patient as the catheterization procedure at bedside is straightforward and does not require fluoroscopic guidance. However, non-tunneled catheters are associated with higher rates of dialysis interruption, lower venous and arterial access pressure, higher incidence of re-catheterization, and decreased filter life during CRRT. As for the length of the catheter, catheters placed in the femoral vein are usually longer as it is associated with less catheter dysfunction. The catheter tip location is also widely recognized to be related to catheter dysfunction, with positioning it in the right atrium or inferior vena cava known to reduce the risk of dysfunction. In this study, however, there was no significant association between the catheter tip location and catheter dysfunction (Table 2). We suggested that catheter dysfunction in the early period following CRRT initiation may be primarily influenced by factors such as vascular access or laboratory variables, rather than the catheter tip location.

### Long-term management of the tunneled venous catheter [^d6bd0ad0]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Despite their propensity for significant complications, tunneled central venous catheters have become a common means of vascular access in the United States for patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reasons for their use include advanced patient age, peripheral vascular disease (arterial and venous), late referral for creation of vascular access, and more importantly, the lack of an interdisciplinary service line on vascular access among vascular surgeons, radiologists, and nephrologists. This review article summarizes complications commonly encountered in dialysis patients who use tunneled central venous catheters for vascular access-mainly thrombosis, stenosis, and infection. Special attention is given to novel approaches for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. Effective prevention and timely treatment of common catheter-associated complications can reduce the substantial morbidity associated with the use of these devices. However, these measures should not detract from the goal of avoiding or limiting the long-term use of catheters, thereby optimizing vascular access management by ensuring the timely availability of functioning arteriovenous fistulas.

### Hemodialysis tunneled central venous catheters: five-year outcome analysis [^e57a0dfa]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tunneled central venous catheters (tCVCs) are considered inferior to arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts in all nephrology guidelines. However, they are being increasingly used as hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of this study was to document the natural history of tCVCs and determine the rate and type of catheter replacement.

Methods

This was a prospective study of 141 patients who underwent hemodialysis with tCVCs between January 2008 and December 2012. The patients used 154 tCVCs. Standard protocols about management of tCVCs, according to European Renal Best Practice, were well established. All catheters were inserted in the internal jugular vein. Criteria for catheter removal were persistent bloodstream infection, detection of an outbreak of catheter-related bloodstream (CRBS) infections, or catheter dysfunction. Event rates were calculated per 1,000 catheter days; tCVC cumulative survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

Catheter replacement occurred in 15 patients (0.29 per 1,000 days); catheter dysfunction was the main cause of replacement (0.18 per 1,000 days), typically within 12 months of surgical insertion. A total of 53 CRBS events in 36 patients were identified (0.82 per 1,000 days); 17 organisms, most commonly Gram-positive pathogens, were isolated; 87% of CVC infections were treated by systemic antibiotics associated with lock therapy. tCVC cumulative survival was 91% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years and 85% at 4 years.

Conclusions

Our data show a high survival rate of tCVCs in hemodialysis patients, with low incidence of catheter dysfunction and CRBS events. These data justify tCVC use for hemodialysis vascular access, also as first choice, especially in patients with exhausted peripheral access and limited life expectancy.

### Catheter-related obstruction of the right brachiocephalic vein following hemodialysis in a patient with lupus nephritis [^bd4c3836]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Vascular access is necessary for hemodialysis, and in some cases where it is difficult to establish an arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous graft, a permanent hemodialysis catheter may be used. However, serious catheter-related complications, such as central vein stenosis or thrombosis, can occur. We herein present a case of complete brachiocephalic vein obstruction in a patient with lupus nephritis receiving hemodialysis using a tunneled hemodialysis catheter. A 64-year-old patient underwent maintenance hemodialysis while taking an anticoagulant, with a tunneled hemodialysis catheter in the right internal jugular vein, because of arteriovenous fistula failure when hemodialysis was introduced. However, the catheter was removed because of a catheter-related bloodstream infection. Following the administration of antibiotics, an arteriovenous graft was implanted between the brachial artery and axillary vein in the right arm. Surprisingly, arteriovenous graft failure and complete obstruction of the right brachiocephalic vein were observed 3 days after arteriovenous graft creation. In conclusion, we report the case of tunneled hemodialysis catheter-related complete obstruction of the right brachiocephalic vein in a lupus nephritis patient undergoing hemodialysis. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when tunneled hemodialysis catheters are used and consider the next vascular access type before a tunneled hemodialysis catheter has been indwelled for the long term.

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^b088eca5]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients on maintenance haemodialysis require a reliable vascular access. Ideally, every haemodialysis patient should have a sufficiently matured arteriovenous fistula at the start of haemodialysis. However, maturation failure occurs in roughly one in three patients, while others have no suitable vessels to create a durable arteriovenous access due to pre-existing vascular pathology. In addition, some patients develop a rapidly progressive kidney disease, which precludes timely planning for an arteriovenous access. For these reasons, 68% of patients in Europe initialize dialysis using a central venous catheter (CVC) for vascular access. The use of CVCs among prevalent haemodialysis patients was 32% in 2009.

A CVC has several disadvantages, with the risk of infection and catheter malfunction being the main challenges. Current guidelines recommend to remove the CVC in almost all catheter-related infections. Furthermore, a CVC with catheter malfunction has to be removed eventually in most cases. – This is an important issue for patients dependent on a CVC for haemodialysis. Therefore, several recommendations are made to prevent loss of CVC. For example, the European Renal Best Practice guideline states that non-tunnelled central venous catheters (NTCVCs) should be avoided as much as possible, since the risk of infection compared to tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVCs) is even higher. A possible explanation for this could be the lack of a cuff to act as a barrier against invasion of bacteria from the exit site into the systemic circulation. The literature on this subject, however, is of older age. With the present-day hygiene measurements and the introduction of precurved NTCVCs inserted in the low jugular position, it is a subject of discussion whether these recommendations still hold true.

In this study, the primary objective was to assess whether precurved NTCVCs are comparable to TCVCs in terms of a combined endpoint of infection and catheter malfunction. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether precurved NTCVCs are superior to straight NTCVCs for these adverse outcomes.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^cf7e14fa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

CVC tip position, malposition, and troubleshooting — postinsertion imaging should be considered to avoid malpositioning, and proper location for the CVC tip is at the mid right atrium to avoid vessel and right atrial trauma and consequent complications. Complications were documented in 1% of right internal jugular vein placements via ultrasound guidance in a retrospective single-center study where 75% of CVCs were placed by trainees, and in a prospective study 1.4% of right internal jugular vein CVCs were malpositioned when placed by an anesthesiologist using anatomic landmarks without image guidance. Factors associated with tunneled CVC tip malpositioning include change in position from supine to upright, which may be accentuated in obese and female patients, and consistent with the 2006 KDOQI guideline, it is reasonable to consider imaging for correct CVC location when catheter dysfunction persists that is unresponsive to conservative maneuvers and tPA administration.

Case Presentation

Case 1

A 67-year-old female presented on February 4, 2023, with a 4-day history of chills and fever during hemodialysis via a right internal jugular vein TCC. The patient was diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ANCA-associated vasculitis in February 2016, at which time a 14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter (Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA) was initially implanted for hemodialysis. In December 2018, she was hospitalized for progressive facial and neck swelling over 6 months, diagnosed with SVC stenosis. Under digital subtraction angiography (DSA), balloon angioplasty was performed, followed by placement of a 13.5 mm×6 cm Fluency covered stent (Bard Medical, New Jersey, USA) in the SVC. A new TCC (14.5Fr-36 cm Palindrome catheter) was reinserted through the stent into the right atrium. Postoperatively, the facial and neck edema resolved, and the TCC functioned adequately.

In June 2021, she was readmitted with an 8-day history of fever and 4 days of hypotension, diagnosed with septic shock, bacteremia, and CRBSI. The right internal jugular TCC was removed, and antimicrobial therapy was initiated. After 12 days of anti-infection treatment, the infection was brought under control, during this period, right femoral vein NCC dialysis was used. Ultrasonography confirmed occlusion of the right internal jugular vein, prompting TCC reinsertion via the right brachiocephalic vein under DSA guidance.

On February 4, 2023, the patient was hospitalized again for tunnel infection and CRBSI involving the TCC.

On admission, physical examination revealed a 6 cm × 4 cm abscess along the right brachiocephalic vein TCC tunnel, characterized by localized erythema, warmth, tenderness, and fluctuance (Figure 1 A). Based on clinical history and examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, TCC-related bloodstream infection, and TCC tunnel infection. Immediate management included incision and drainage of the abscess and removal of the infected TCC. Microbiological cultures of peripheral blood, catheter blood, catheter tip, and pus all identified Staphylococcus aureus as the causative pathogen.

### Cardiac assist devices and hemodialysis catheter procedures-what Do the nephrologists need to know? [^d9ad3d60]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The use of ventricular assist devices (VAD) and total artificial heart (TAH) is increasing rapidly, and a large proportion of these device recipients already have or will develop severe renal dysfunction at the time of device implantation. As a consequence, nephrologists are becoming more and more involved in the care of this challenging population. As nephrologists take upon themselves many aspects of dialysis vascular access care, they need to be familiar with the special circumstances of performing hemodialysis catheter procedures in these patients. This review describes the important characteristics of these devices that have serious implications for the technique of placing or replacing dialysis catheters. These implications apply for both tunneled and nontunneled dialysis catheters and so concern all nephrologists, not only the interventionalists. We describe the important anatomical factors, anticoagulation management, device management, vascular access management and technical considerations of placing or replacing tunneled and nontunneled hemodialysis catheters from the perspective of a nephrologist establishing and maintaining lifesaving dialysis vascular access. Without a good understanding of these devices, serious consequences such as VAD rotor damage or blockage, or artificial heart valve blockage or damage can occur. These artificial devices are lifesaving, and any such complication is unacceptable. This review describes steps to minimize the risks.

### Managing the complications of long-term tunneled dialysis catheters [^c2037c66]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines call for a significant increase in the use of natural vein fistulas. Long-term tunneled dialysis catheters (LTTDCs) will have an important role in facilitating the maturation of natural vein fistulas. LTTDCs also functions as the access of last resort in patients who refuse or have exhausted other forms of permanent vascular access. This article, which is based on the authors' experience as interventional nephrologists, discusses factors influencing catheter function. In addition, the article reviews common complications associated with dialysis catheter insertion, including immediate, short-term, and long-term complications. The topics reviewed include stenoses, thrombus formation, fibrin sheath formation, infections, and vascular ingrowth. Suggestions for management are also discussed.

### Radiologically placed tunneled internal jugular catheters in the management of chronic hemodialysis and long-term infusion therapies in the pediatric population [^de91eaff]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of radiologically inserted dual-lumen hemodialysis and infusion catheters in pediatric patients.

Materials and Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 114 tunneled internal jugular catheters in 71 consecutive pediatric patients between March 2003 and May 2006. Forty hemodialysis catheters were placed in 23 patients (11 girls, 12 boys), and 74 infusion catheters were placed in 48 patients (14 girls, 34 boys). The mean patient age was 11.2 years (range, 1–16 years) in the hemodialysis group and 7.86 years (range, 4 months to 16 years) in the infusion group.

Results

The technical success rate was 100%. The mean duration of catheter use was 84 days (range, 5–730 days) in the hemodialysis group and 58 days (range, 3–206 days) in the infusion group. Nine hemodialysis (22%) and 29 infusion (39%) catheters were electively removed. The most common reasons for catheter removal were malfunction (22%) in the hemodialysis group and completion of therapy (39%) in the infusion group. Revisions were performed at a rate of 0.6 and 0.4 per 100 catheters days in the hemodialysis and infusion groups, respectively. Total infection rates were 0.15 and 0.38 episodes per 100 catheter days in hemodialysis and infusion catheters, respectively. Mean primary device service intervals were 86 and 60 days for hemodialysis and infusion catheters, respectively, with total access site service intervals of 140 and 71 days.

Conclusion

Radiologically placed tunneled internal jugular catheters appear to be safe and effective, with very low complication rates for both hemodialysis and long-term infusion therapies. Higher infection rates were seen in patients with cancer.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^fff0a6d7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluoroscopy is imaging which uses x-rays to obtain real-time dynamic images, allowing direct visualisation of the guidewire, which often must negotiate angulation or stenosis, and otherwise may pass aberrantly into the azygous vein. Catheter tip position, which is critical for optimal blood flow, is also visualised: tips should be located within the right atrium (preferably mid-level) since proximal locations encourage fibrin sheath formation and distal locations may lead to arrhythmias, tricuspid regurgitation or inferior vena cava stenosis. In a retrospective study of 532 tunnelled internal jugular haemodialysis catheters, tip position within the right atrium, rather than the superior vena cava, reduced catheter dysfunction, in particular for left-sided catheters. Fluoroscopy seems to reduce misplacement: in a retrospective study of 202 catheter insertions, the addition of fluoroscopy was associated with reduced catheter misplacement (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02–0.71), though the advantage may be restricted to left-sided catheters. In another retrospective study of 104 catheters inserted without fluoroscopy, tip malposition (in brachiocephalic or azygous vein) occurred in 6/20 inserted on the left side, but none of the 68 inserted on the right side. Fluoroscopy therefore appears to have obvious advantage at least with left-sided insertions, and has become standard for all catheter insertions in many units.

Catheter conversion (whereby a tunnelled catheter is inserted by wire exchange of a temporary non-tunnelled catheter) has traditionally been avoided by many clinicians, primarily due to infection concerns, though these may be unfounded. In a prospective study of 358 catheter conversions, bacteraemia rates were comparable to de novo insertions (0.8 per 100 days) with similar patency also. Authors note that the location of the temporary catheter, which may be too proximal for optimal tip position and patient comfort, needs to be considered.

Infection is a common catheter-related complication, which is associated with hospital admission and mortality, with risks increased particularly in the early post-procedure period. In most units therefore it has become standard to administer a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic at the time of insertion, either before or after, though high-quality supportive data are hard to find. In one randomised study of 60 haemodialysis catheter insertions, compared to saline placebo, a composite catheter infection endpoint was less frequent in the cefazolin group (1 v 3 events, accurate statistics not reported).

### Safety and efficacy of placing internal jugular dialysis catheter tip in the inferior vena cava [^b049a64f]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of placing the tip of the internal jugular (IJ) hemodialysis catheter in the inferior vena cava (IVC) in situations where it does not work well when placed in the right atrium.

Methods

The medical records of chronic hemodialysis patients at an outpatient vascular intervention facility were retrospectively reviewed. Out of the 831 patients who had dialysis catheters exchanged over a 4-year period, 13 patients were identified who underwent catheter exchanges where the tip of the catheter was placed in the IVC via the IJ approach. These were all patients where the catheters had poor flows when placed in the right atrium earlier.

Results

Adequate flow (>350 mL/min) was achieved in all 13 cases with the catheter placed in the IVC with no significant complications.

Conclusions

This study suggests that exchanging the catheter and placing the tip in the IVC is effective and safe in certain situations especially when the tip placement in the conventional position (i.e. the right atrium) does not work well.

### Non-tunneled versus tunneled dialysis catheters for acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy: a prospective cohort study [^82398045]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal replacement delivery parameters

We compared metrics of RRT delivery and performance between NTDCs and TDCs in multivariable-adjusted analyses at the catheter level (Table 2). Compared to TDCs, NTDCs had statistically significantly lower median venous and arterial access pressures. TDCs allowed for significantly higher mean blood flow rates than NTDCs when used for IHD but not for CVVH (blood flows for CVVH are prescribed at 250 ml/min as standard at our institution). The rate of interrupted delivery of CVVH due to catheter malfunction was more than twice as high for NTDCs than TDCs (adjusted rate ratio of 2.7; p < 0.001); other metrics of adequacy of CVVH including hours of treatment and mean BUN levels were not different across the two types of catheters. Results were qualitatively unchanged in analyses restricted to nontunneled and tunneled catheters placed in the internal jugular vein (data not shown).

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^736f483a]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study shows that TCVCs and precurved NTCVCs are comparable in terms of reaching the combined endpoint of catheter-related infections and catheter malfunction. This is an important observation because the most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guideline recommends to use a TCVC in case a CVC for haemodialysis is needed for more than 1 week. This guideline is of older age (2006), and the use of precurved catheters is not yet mentioned in this guideline. In previous observational studies, TCVCs were repeatedly associated with lower risk of infections compared to NTCVCs. The NTCVCs in these studies were all straight CVCs. In our study, we show that straight NTCVCs have a higher risk of infections and catheter malfunction compared to precurved NTCVCs. This can explain the advantage of TCVCs over NTCVCs in the previous literature. Randomized controlled trials comparing TCVCs with precurved NTCVCs are lacking. In line with our current study, Weijmer et al.showed in an observational trial in 2008 that precurved jugular NTCVCs had a lower risk of infection and less catheter malfunction than straight jugular NTCVCs. To our knowledge, this is the only study to compare these catheters.

### Mediastinal approach to the placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheters in patients with central vein occlusion in an outpatient access center [^13a88b4a]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Endovascular therapy for hemodialysis (HD) access is now performed in outpatient centers in a growing number of cities in the US. As patients live longer, we are facing a growing number of patients with central venous occlusion. We report our first three cases of mediastinal tunneled dialysis catheter placement in a clinic setting.

Methods

Between 15 November 2009 and 1 April 2010, three patients with central vein occlusion required tunneled HD catheter placement. Case #1 was a 60-year-old male with left subclavian and innominate vein occlusion from a defibrillator pacemaker and two previous right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheters with occlusion of the right internal jugular vein. He lost right arm access after two failed arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and an occluded upper arm AV graft. His last right external jugular catheter was removed for infection. Case #2 was a 72-year-old female with a thrombosed left upper arm and a right basilic vein AV access. She had a history of left leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a vena cava filter. The left and right internal jugular veins were occluded as well as the left subclavian vein after stent placement. She required a tunneled HD catheter after a failed attempt at endovascular salvage of her right basilic AVF. Case #3 was a 78-year-old female who had been on HD for 4 yr. She refused AVF surgery and had four tunneled HD catheters removed for infection. She presented with bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis and the removal of an infected right subclavian tunneled HD catheter. THE TECHNIQUE: The dialysis catheters were placed using standard C-arm fluoroscopy. We accessed the right femoral vein to pass a Berenstein catheter (Cordis, Inc, Warren, NJ) into the right innominate-subclavian vein junction. Using the catheter as a fluoroscopic target, a micropuncture needle was guided into the right innominate vein and a standard J-guidewire was used to dilate the mediastinal tract and place a new tunneled dialysis catheter.

Results

In all three cases, the tunneled dialysis catheters were placed under local anesthesia with no intravenous sedation. No pneumothorax occurred and all three catheters were used for HD within 24 hr. Two catheters were removed at 3 and 4 months for infection. One catheter continues to function well.

Conclusions

As the lifespan of our dialysis patient population continues to improve, we will see an increasing need to perform complicated access procedures to maintain HD support. These three cases emphasize the value of the transmediastinal technique using basic C-arm fluoroscopy and a limited stock of basic catheters and guidewires.

In one observational study of right-versus left-sided catheter placement (409 participants and 532 catheters), catheter-related infection requiring removal was significantly higher with left-sided approaches compared with right-sided approaches (0.33 vs 0.24 per 100 catheter-days; P = 0.012), while decreased blood flow requiring CVC exchange was nonsignificantly higher with left-sided approaches (0.13 vs 0.08 per 100 catheter-days; P = 0.08). However, these outcomes were modified based on the positioning of the CVC tip.

### A longitudinal study of the repeated use of alteplase as therapy for tunneled hemodialysis catheter dysfunction [^a3ae62a2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

When hemodialysis catheters allow only poor or no blood flow, it has become established practice in many centers to instill a thrombolytic agent in an attempt to clear the catheter. The catheter survival advantage gained by repeated use of such treatment is not known. In a prospective study, we analyzed all uses of alteplase in the setting of inadequate catheter blood flow in a cohort of 570 catheters over a 2(1/2)-year period. The time from alteplase instillation to the next episode in which it was required or catheter removal for nonfunction or thrombosis was recorded. Survival analysis was used to estimate the additional catheter survival afforded by each treatment. After censoring for elective catheter removal, the overall catheter half-life was 10.2 months. Catheter malfunction or thrombosis was the most common indication for catheter removal (36.3% of all catheters removed). Alteplase instillation was necessary in 2.77% of dialysis sessions. The median time from the first to second treatment or catheter removal for nonfunction or thrombosis was 27 days (95% confidence interval, 15.7 to 32.3). Additional median survival advantage gained from each subsequent treatment ranged from 10 to 18 days. Treatment of recurrent catheter malfunction with alteplase allows for a median of only five to seven additional dialysis sessions before the treatment must be repeated or the catheter must be exchanged. Although associated with minimal disruption to the dialysis schedule, the ultimate clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of such treatment is doubtful.

### Long-term durability of tunneled hemodialysis catheters: outcomes from a single institution 22-year experience [^0c1d150c]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tunneled hemodialysis catheters are durable and rarely requiring removal or repair for hub- or clamp-related issues after one year. Catheter hubs and clamps are mechanically vulnerable and were the only sites of breakage found in catheters with greater than 1 year dwell time. Catheter breakage was not observed as a long-term durability issue, and the broken external components identified in this study can frequently be fixed using repair kits. Further, while one-third of the catheters in our study were removed because they were no longer needed, two-thirds of the catheters were removed of complications. The high rate of complications resulting in removal affirms that long-term catheters should be avoided if possible.

### Deeper may not be better: relationship between catheter dysfunction and location of the catheter tip in right-sided tunnelled haemodialysis catheters [^eae019df]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine the relationship between catheter tip location and catheter dysfunction in the context of tunnelled central venous catheters (CVCs) for haemodialysis.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study of 993 haemodialysis patients who underwent insertion of tunnelled CVCs of step-tip design via the right internal jugular vein (IJV). Based on intra-procedural radiographs, the catheter tip was characterised as being in the superior vena cava (SVC), cavo-atrial junction (CAJ), or deep right atrium (DRA). Patients were tracked for 90 days post-procedure for complications resulting in catheter replacement, and these were compared between cohorts. Statistical analysis was performed with Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and two-sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.

Results

Ninety-five patients (9.6%) experienced catheter dysfunction necessitating replacement within 90 days of insertion. Tip location in SVC was associated with lower occurrence of catheter dysfunction (1.9%) as compared with the CAJ (8%) and DRA (11%; p = 0.049). Catheter replacement due to other complications (catheter-associated bacteraemia, cuff dislodgement, exit-site infection, external catheter damage) showed no statistically significant relation to location of the CVC tip.

Conclusion

When utilising tunnelled CVCs with a step-tip design inserted via the right IJV, location of the catheter tip in the SVC is associated with reduced occurrence of catheter dysfunction as compared to either the CAJ or DRA.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^f4734ebe]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

A proportion of catheters may develop complications over time, of which the most common are dysfunction (poor flow) and infection. As with AV access, much of the literature on catheter complications is limited by small study populations and short term outcomes, leaving many knowledge gaps, so that an evidence-based consensus is not possible for all aspects of management. Since the optimal approach is not always clear, pragmatic shared decisions should be made, taking into account clinical risk, likely treatment outcome and patient preference.

Catheter dysfunction

Tunnelled dialysis catheter dysfunction is a common problem, usually defined as inability of the catheter to deliver a blood flow of at least 300 ml/min in adult patients. Dysfunction from the time of insertion is generally due to poor positioning or kinking (rare following fluoroscopic guided insertion) and usually identified and corrected soon after insertion, through manipulation or repositioning. A catheter which previously functioned well but then delivers poor flow is considered to have late dysfunction, and this is may be caused by thrombus or fibrin, either within the catheter lumen or around the tip, though the distinction is in most cases not important, and imaging is not necessary. Fibrin forms around the external surface of most catheters, like a sheath, sometimes extending beyond the catheter tip.

If flows become problematic during haemodialysis, then repositioning, saline flushes or reversing the catheter lumens may provide a temporary solution, allowing completion of the session. However, these solutions do not address the cause of poor flow and are rarely durable - further treatment options include thrombolytic agents and mechanical measures (removing fibrin, usually at the same time as replacing the catheter). Thrombolytic therapy is immediately available in the dialysis unit, and is usually attempted initially, as it is often able to restore function quickly allowing dialysis to continue without too much interruption.

### Broken clamp on a cuffed tunneled catheter – are all catheters equal? [^5aa514bc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The use of a cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC) as an initial access in the incident hemodialysis population in the United States remains high. Several different brands of catheters are available for clinical use. Their mechanical problems (such as broken clamps, hubs or leaking and cracked extension tubes) are seldom reported in the literature, even though they add to morbidity and higher health care expense. This study highlights issues related to commonly used catheters and suggests, in the interest of patient safety, a need for improved regulatory oversight in the manufacturing of CTCs.

Ethics statement

This retrospective study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuzhou Central Hospital (NO.XZXY-LK-20231116-0186). As the study was retrospective and posed minimal risk to participants, the need for patient informed consent was waived.

Relevant criteria and definitions

(1) Catheter malfunction: The extracorporeal blood flow through the catheter does not meet the requirements for adequate dialysis when the original dialysis duration is not extended.

(2) Central vein stenosis (CVS): Central veins typically refer to the SVC, brachiocephalic vein, subclavian vein, and internal jugular vein. Central venous stenosis refers to the narrowing of these vessels. This study focuses solely on stenosis related to the SVC.

Dialysis model

Hemodialysis(HD) or Hemodiafiltration (HDF) or Haemodialysis combined with Haemoperfusion (HD + HP), all were treated with low molecular heparin anticoagulation. The patient is required to undergo dialysis for a period of four hours per session, with a total of three sessions per week.

### Treatment of tunneled dialysis catheter malfunction: revision versus exchange [^9ad9ab29]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exchange procedures involve tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) removal and exchange over a wire, using the same exit site and venotomy site. Diagnostic imaging or intervention was generally not performed in exchange procedures. Revision procedures involve placement of new TDC using the previous venotomy site and a new tunnel and exit site. The majority of revisions usually include diagnostic imaging and intervention in the central circulation if needed.

Methods

A retrospective single review of 70 patients who underwent 97 TDC replacements from 2010 to early 2012 because of catheter malfunction was evaluated for either infection or malfunction within 30 days of the procedure.

Results

There were 41 exchanges and 56 revisions out of the 97 procedures performed. There were eight infections (documented by positive blood culture) in the exchanges (19.5%) and one in the revision group (1.8%). The need for an additional procedure due to malfunction was 10 in the exchange (24.4%) and 10 (17.8%) in the revision group.

Conclusions

Revision is a clearly superior procedure with regard to infection and more data need to be gathered as to whether it will decrease repeat procedures.

### Risk factors of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a retrospective study [^08fef75d]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors of catheter dysfunction other than the vascular access remain unclear in patients undergoing CRRT since most studies evaluated patients requiring iHD. In a prospective observational study that analyzed clinical and laboratory variables in addition to vascular access sites for the risk of non-tunneled non-cuffed catheter malfunction during iHD, femoral vein access was identified as the sole independent risk factor. In a retrospective study analyzing potential risk factors of tunneled hemodialysis catheter dysfunction, female sex, normal PT levels, and left internal jugular vein access were associated with catheter dysfunction. A more recent competing risk analysis study evaluating potential predictors for thrombosis and infection of tunneled hemodialysis catheters showed similar results with the aforementioned study. Female sex showed a near two-fold risk of catheter thrombosis compared to male sex and hypertension and obesity were also identified as risk factors. Several prospective studies have shown higher risk of catheter thrombosis in females compared to males, which is contrary to risk of venous thrombosis with regards to sex. Relative size discrepancy between the catheter and the accessed vein, or location of catheter tip, which both directly affect the flow rate, may have contributed to the increased risk of catheter dysfunction in females. Hypertension has been reported as a risk factor in another single-center study to increase the risk of catheter dysfunction, not only as a cause of hemodialysis but also as a comorbidity.

The association between less prolonged levels of PT and increased risk of catheter dysfunction requires careful and cautious interpretation. As the levels of PT in patients with catheter dysfunction were also higher than the normal range, it would be more appropriate to interpret the result that the higher level of PT decreased the risk of catheter dysfunction, rather than the lower level of PT increased the risk. Regarding the levels of aPTT, which were slightly prolonged in patients with catheter dysfunction, we found that the prolongation was primarily attributable to the patients requiring switch of lumen. The aPTT levels in patients requiring catheter repositioning or re-catheterization were relatively lower compared to those requiring a lumen switch, and even among patients without catheter dysfunction, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition to the use of intra-circuit nafamostat mesilate to reduce circuit thrombosis, it may be possible that anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin in this study may have influenced the aPTT levels. However, considering the impact of PT levels, data seems to be insufficient to provide a plausible explanation for the association of prolonged aPTT with catheter dysfunction.

Temporary pacing strategy during TAVR — most centers implant a transvenous pacing wire via the internal jugular or femoral vein to provide rapid ventricular pacing; for patients with ports, dialysis catheters, and/or hemodialysis fistula, the document states "we recommend placement of temporary transvenous pacemaker via the femoral vein." Recent data suggest that placing a guidewire directly into the left ventricle (LV) can provide rapid ventricular pacing, and in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial, LV pacing had shorter operative time (48.4 ± 16.9 min vs. 55.6 ± 26.9 min; p = 0.0013), shorter fluoroscopy time (13.48 ± 5.98 min vs. 14.60 ± 5.59 min; p = 0.02), and lower cost (€18,807 ± 1,318 vs. €19,437 ± 2,318; p = 0.001) compared with right ventricular pacing with similar efficacy and safety.

### Placement issues of hemodialysis catheters with pre-existing central lines and catheters [^62c654ea]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been a widely accepted practice that a previous placed pacemaker, automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or central line can be a contraindication to placing a hemodialysis catheter in the ipsilateral jugular vein. Fear of dislodging pacing wires, tunneling close to the battery site or causing venous obstruction has been a concern for surgeons and interventionalists alike. We suggest that this phobia may be unfounded.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of patients in whom hemodialysis catheters were placed over a period of 10years. For each hemodialysis catheter that was placed, perioperative chest X-ray performed was used to evaluate for pre-existing pacemakers and central lines. The position and laterality of placement of the hemodialysis catheter along with presence of arteriovenous fistula with functional capacity for access were noted.

Results

A total of 600 hemodialysis catheters were placed in patients over the period of 10years. The mean age of the patients was 73.6 ± 12years with a median age of 76years. We found 20 pacemakers or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators and 19 central lines on the same side of the neck as the hemodialysis catheter that was placed in the ipsilateral jugular vein. No patient exhibited malfunction or dislodgment of the central line, the pacemaker, or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator or evidence of upper extremity venous obstruction based upon signs symptoms or duplex exams.

Conclusion

Based on our experience, we suggest that placement of hemodialysis catheter in the internal jugular vein ipsilateral to the pre-existing catheter/leads is safe and spares the contralateral limb for arteriovenous fistula creation.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery: clinical practice guidelines for the surgical placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access [^ec4db2f8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous access early thrombosis — causes and revision decisions emphasize that in a way, early thrombosis represents the more extreme form of failure to mature, with Insufficient arterial inflow, poor venous outflow, and anastomotic stenoses as the most common reasons and additional contributors including surgical technical errors, intrinsic coagulation state, drops in systemic blood pressure, and poor cardiac output. Management must be individualized because surgical re-exploration of the access may or may not be worthwhile; it may make more sense to evaluate alternative sites with a view toward placing a new access, whereas tunnel compression or graft kinking would require prompt urgent exploration. Revision options span from a simple thrombectomy to creation of completely new proximal anastomoses, and thrombectomy alone would not be expected to result in long-term access patency if the stenosis is not addressed.

### Interventions for treating central venous haemodialysis catheter malfunction [^97269c1a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin-sheath stripping, over-the-wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late-onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over-the-wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD -27.70 days, 95% CI -51.00 to -4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long-term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.

### Optimal timing for secondary arteriovenous fistula creation: devastating effects of delaying conversion [^887055e3]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

A chronic hemodialysis patient was referred to interventional nephrology for evaluation of arteriovenous access dysfunction. The patient had been receiving hemodialysis using a left forearm brachiobasilic loop graft for the past 3 years. Physical examination revealed a hyperpulsatile graft. Angiography documented a critical stenosis at the vein-graft anastomosis and a well-developed basilic vein from the elbow to the axillary region. Central veins were patent all the way to the right atrium. All attempts to navigate the wire across the stenosis failed. The patient was educated and counseled regarding the possibility of surgical creation of a secondary arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The images obtained were shared and discussed with the surgeon. A plan to create a secondary AVF using the basilic vein in the arm was made. A few months later the patient was referred to interventional nephrology, this time for thrombectomy of the same left arm loop graft. Thrombectomy could not be performed and a right internal jugular tunneled catheter was inserted. The patient again was referred to the surgeon for AVF creation. Six weeks later the patient was seen in the interventional laboratory for removal of the right internal jugular tunneled catheter. It was noted that instead of a fistula, the patient had received a right forearm brachiocephalic loop graft. Devastating consequences, such as the lost opportunity to create a fistula, insertion of a tunneled dialysis catheter, arteriovenous graft placement, exhaustion of available sites for fistula creation, and exposure to increased morbidity and mortality associated with grafts and catheters, can result if the opportunity to create a secondary AVF is not availed in a timely manner. This concept must be understood by every member of the vascular access team.

### Hemodialysis catheter breakage in an infant [^7fe49802]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

A 3-month-old male infant was admitted to our unit due to acute decompensation of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology. Further investigation led to the diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. As the patient did not recover, hemodialysis was initiated with a non-tunneled femoral catheter. A tunneled Hickman catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein. The patient experienced moderate intradialytic exit-site bleeding and catheter malfunction, which initially responded to pressure and postural changes. During the third session, the patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. After stabilization, a chest hematoma was identified. Fluoroscopy revealed a catheter breakage. Despite initial stabilization, the patient developed septic shock due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and died several days later. Hemodialysis is sometimes necessary in children under 24months with chronic kidney disease. Vascular access is a major challenge in these patients due to lack of appropriate catheter sizes and high complication rates. Hemodialysis catheter fracture is an uncommon complication, and diagnosis can be difficult when the breakage involves the subcutaneous segment. Persistent intradialytic bleeding and mechanical malfunction should raise suspicion of this complication and should elicit catheter revision under fluoroscopy. Without prompt diagnosis, catheter breakage may have fatal consequences, as in our case.

To provide an adequate blood flow and reduce recirculation, the tip of the double-lumen catheter should be placed in the large veins, and optimal catheter lengths are 12–15 cm for the right internal jugular vein, 15–20 cm for the left internal jugular vein, and 19–24 cm for the femoral vein. The outer diameter varies between 11 and 14 French, and larger sizes decrease the risk of inadequate blood flow.

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^ffee6504]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

The main limitations of central venous catheters for haemodialysis access are infections and catheter malfunction. Our objective was to assess whether precurved non-tunnelled central venous catheters are comparable to tunnelled central venous catheters in terms of infection and catheter malfunction and to assess whether precurved non-tunnelled catheters are superior to straight catheters.

Materials and methods:

In this retrospective, observational cohort study, adult patients in whom a central venous catheter for haemodialysis was inserted between 2012 and 2016 were included. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint consisting of the first occurrence of either an infection or catheter malfunction. The secondary endpoint was a combined endpoint of the removal of the central venous catheter due to either an infection or a catheter malfunction. Using multivariable analysis, cause-specific hazard ratios for endpoints were calculated for tunnelled catheter versus precurved non-tunnelled catheter, tunnelled catheter versus non-tunnelled catheter, and precurved versus straight non-tunnelled catheter.

Results:

A total of 1603 patients were included. No difference in reaching the primary endpoint was seen between tunnelled catheters, compared to precurved non-tunnelled catheters (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.19, p = 0.48). Tunnelled catheters were removed less often, compared to precurved non-tunnelled catheters (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.93; p = 0.02). A trend for less infections and catheter malfunctions was seen in precurved jugular non-tunnelled catheters compared to straight non-tunnelled catheters (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–1.50; p = 0.28) and were removed less often (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.93; p = 0.03).

Conclusion:

Tunnelled central venous catheters and precurved non-tunnelled central venous catheters showed no difference in reaching the combined endpoint of catheter-related infections and catheter malfunction. Tunnelled catheters get removed less often because of infection/malfunction than precurved non-tunnelled catheters.

### Risk factors of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a retrospective study [^1f36959b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Renal replacement therapy and catheter management

During the study period, the dose, blood flow rate, type of dialysis solution or use of anticoagulant within the circuit were determined by physicians taking care of the patient. Two types of CRRT machines, the Prismaflex® system (Baxter International Inc. Deerfield, IL, USA) and the multiFiltrate® system (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany) was in use. For intra-circuit anticoagulation, nafamostat mesilate was used at a dose of 20 mg/hr to increase filter lifespan without increasing the risk of bleeding at the discretion of the physician. Initiation and discontinuation of CRRT, as well as the decision to convert to iHD, were at the discretion of the attending physician.

Under ultrasonography guidance, 11.5 Fr dual lumen acute dialysis catheters (Medtronic PLC, Dublin, Ireland) were placed at bedside. The site for vascular access and the insertion depth of the catheter was left at the discretion of the physician. In general, 16 cm catheters were used for right internal jugular vein access and 19.5 cm catheters were used for left internal jugular vein or femoral vein access.

Definition

Catheter dysfunction was defined as the need for catheter handling, including switching between the access and return lumens, catheter repositioning, or re-catheterization within 48 h to maintain adequate pressure and blood flow within the circuit. A CRRT session was defined as the period from the initiation to the termination of CRRT or temporal cessation for re-catheterization. For patient with multiple sessions of CRRT during the period, only the first session of each separate vascular access was included for analysis. Consequently, the maximum number of sessions that could be included was 4 per patient.

### Risk of bacteremia from temporary hemodialysis catheters by site of insertion and duration of use: a prospective study [^17313d7f]. Kidney International (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Uncuffed, nontunneled hemodialysis catheters remain the preferred means to gain immediate access to the circulation for hemodialysis. Bacteremia is the primary complication that limits their use. The risk of bacteremia by site of insertion and duration of use has not been well studied.

Methods

Two hundred eighteen consecutive patients who required a temporary hemodialysis catheter were prospectively followed.

Results

Catheters were placed at 318 new insertion sites and remained in use for a total of 6235 days. The incidence of bacteremia was 5.4% after three weeks of placement in internal jugular vein and 10.7% after one week in femoral vein [relative risk for bacteremia 3.1 (95% CI, 1.8 to 5.2)]. The incidence of bacteremia was 1.9% one day after the onset of an exit site infection but increased to 13.4% by the second day if the catheter was not removed. Guidewire exchange for malfunction and patient factors did not significantly affect the risk of bacteremia.

Conclusions

Internal jugular catheters may be left in place for up to three weeks without a high risk of bacteremia, but femoral catheters in bed-bound patients should be removed after one week. Catheter exchanges over a guidewire for catheter malfunction do not increase bacteremia rates. Temporary catheters should be removed immediately if an exit site infection occurs.

### A roundish dark spot in the upper cava vein [^ae169d49]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our Nephrology department with malfunction of her left-sided tunneled jugular venous hemodialysis catheter. She had been undergoing hemodialysis once a week. Her medical history includes chronic heart and renal failure, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, goiter, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initially, a temporary catheter was used due to volume overload and abnormal lab results, which was later replaced by a long-term catheter.

Four months prior, the long-term catheter was inserted in the left jugular vein using Seldinger's technique, under B-mode ultrasound guidance. Chest X-rays post-placement confirmed correct positioning in the superior caval vein, but the catheter malfunctioned over time. Upon presentation, the patient was stable, with normal vital signs and mild inflammation on the catheter exit site in the left sub-clavicular area.

Laboratory results showed elevated uric acid, BUN, and creatinine, normal hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, lipids, potassium, and INR, mildly elevated glucose, and slightly reduced iron levels (Table 1, lab exams).

### Avoiding problems in tunneled dialysis catheter placement [^f1e4cdc8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs) remain the predominant vascular access for initiation of hemodialysis (HD) worldwide. TDCs are also utilized in a significant number of prevalent patients for continuation of dialysis and during the periods of complications related to arteriovenous (AV) accesses. TDC placement is a routine procedure, but can be associated with mechanical and infectious complications related to placement. Imaging guidance with ultrasound and fluoroscopy has made the placement of TDC safer and more successful. Adequate operator training, careful technique, utilization of a checklist, and barrier precautions are essential to avoid problems related to TDC placement.

### Establishing the learning curve for a tunneled dialysis catheter placement [^ec176c16]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine how many procedures a surgical trainee requires before they are able to place a tunneled double-lumen dialysis catheter safely on their own.

Methods

Surgical trainees unfamiliar with the procedure received a pre-operative briefing in which we explained 1) why, how, and in what particular order each operational step should be executed and 2) what the possible pitfalls/complications are. Next, an experienced surgeon demonstrated the procedure with the trainee scrubbed-in as their assistant. The trainee then performed all successive procedures, while the supervising surgeon acted as a silent observer and intervened only when an error was made. We recorded all errors as well as near misses and noted if they were severe, recurrent or unanticipated. At least three procedures were required but training was continued until less than three errors were made.

Results

Ten trainees were included in the study. On average, a trainee made 11.9 mistakes during 3.4 procedures in a time span of 28.2 days. Only three trainees performed their last procedure flawlessly. The number of errors decreased exponentially from the first procedure onwards (P < .001). A statistically significant correlation was found between the number of mistakes and the number of days since the last procedure (P < .035). Unanticipated errors most frequently involved erroneous fluoroscopy interpretation, flushing with blood-contaminated saline, and incorrect volume injection for the heparin lock.

Conclusions

A theoretically well-prepared surgical trainee should be able to perform the placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter safely after four procedures. Training is more efficient when procedures follow each other quickly.

### Jugular vein-mammary artery fistula after catheterism for hemodialysis: case report [^e841c41e]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

The demographic characteristics of hemodialysis (HD) patients increase the need for the tunneled cuffed permanent catheter (TCC) as a definitive vascular access (VA) for HD. The internal jugular vein is increasingly being used as a route for TCC or temporary catheter placement and can be associated with serious complications. Among them other authors have described arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation between the common carotid artery and the right jugular vein. We describe a case of an AVF between the right internal jugular vein and the right internal mammary artery. The fistula was detected during the TCC placement in a patient who underwent several jugular and subclavian catheterisms for HD in her clinical history.

### Comparison of cuffed tunneled hemodialysis catheter survival [^55696515]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Despite efforts to have hemodialysis patients begin renal replacement therapy with a mature arteriovenous shunt, many patients begin dialysis with a cuffed tunneled catheter as their access. An increasing number of differently designed tunneled hemodialysis catheters have become available in the last decade. The primary aim of this study is to compare catheter survival for Hickman (Bard, Salt Lake City, UT) and Opti-flow (Bard) catheters. The 16-month experience with 182 catheters, totaling 13,861 catheter-days, is reported. The probability of Hickman catheter failure at 30, 60, and 90 days was 29%, 49%, and 67%. The probability of Opti-flow catheter failure was significantly less at 10%, 24%, and 38% for the same times, respectively (P: < 0.05 for all time points). The difference in catheter failure rates was caused by a greater malfunction rate of Hickman catheters; the two catheters had similar infection rates. We conclude that survival of Opti-flow catheters was significantly better than that of Hickman catheters from 30 to 90 days, which is a clinically relevant period when patients are waiting for maturation of a permanent access or replacement of a failed access. Since the conclusion of our study, we documented 10 episodes of Opti-flow catheter malfunction within 4 months secondary to hairline fracture of the arterial hub. The Opti-flow catheter was recalled and is now available with retooled hubs.

### Tunnelled catheters for the haemodialysis patient [^564a88cf]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Haemodialysis depends upon the establishment of a durable means of vascular access. Although the creation of a successful arterio-venous Fistulae (AVF) is the ideal, this is not always possible or practical. Tunnelled catheters play an important role as an interim/bridge technique for emergency access or while an AVF matures, but may be associated with significant morbidity. The aim of this review is to highlight recent evidence based developments in tunnelled catheters, including methods of placement, complications and possible management strategies.

### Precurved non-tunnelled catheters for haemodialysis are comparable in terms of infections and malfunction as compared to tunnelled catheters: a retrospective cohort study [^90e78f19]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

TCVCs have a cuff that acts as a barrier against invasion of bacteria from the exit site into the systemic circulation. Moreover, TCVCs are usually 14–15 French in diameter, compared to 11–12 French in straight CVCs, leading to less catheter malfunction. Our study confirms that TCVCs are indeed less prone to infections and catheter malfunction than straight CVCs.

There are several explanations as to why precurved catheters cause less infections compared to straight NTCVCs. Fixation of straight jugular NTCVCs is more difficult and head and neck movements are limited. Discomfort, due to this limited movement, and inadequate fixation lead to more manipulation of the catheter through the exit site, which can easily cause laceration of the skin and secondary infection of the exit site, a well-known risk factor for catheter-related bloodstream infections. Furthermore, straight jugular catheters have an upward directed exit site, contrary to precurved catheters inserted low in the jugular vein, in which the exit site is directed downward. In catheters for peritoneal dialysis, an upward exit site is a well-known risk factor for exit site infections and peritonitis. Our finding that precurved non-tunnelled catheters have a comparable incidence of infections and catheter malfunction compared to TCVCs can possibly be explained by the fact that the exit site is downward and therefore causes fewer infections. Also, the most frequently used precurved catheters in our study are 15.5 French, the same diameter as most TCVCs, leading to a better flow and therefore less catheter malfunction.

Another finding of our study is that TCVCs are removed less often because of infections or catheter malfunctions compared to precurved NTCVCs. The difference between our primary and secondary endpoint regarding tunnelled and precurved CVCs may reflect the clinical practice in which the removal or replacement of a TCVC is much more complicated than in a precurved catheter. Inserting a new TCVC requires more expertise of the operator and a prolonged procedure time. Also, NTCVCs can easily be replaced over a guidewire. This possibly results in more frequent removal of NTCVCs compared to TCVCs.

Guidelines focus on the prevention of catheter-related infections. However, in our study, catheter malfunction occurred more frequently than catheter-related infections and led to comparable incidence of catheter removal. Due to low number of events, we did not analyse both outcomes separately.

### COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury: consensus report of the 25th Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup [^705d0e31]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Rationale

A number of clinical trials and meta-analyses of RRT initiation strategies in critically ill patients have demonstrated no difference in mortality or renal recovery associated with initiation of RRT in the absence of emergent indications –. The decision to initiate acute RRT in patients with COVID-19 AKI should therefore be individualized, and clinical context should be considered (e.g. initiation of RRT for volume management in patients with severe hypoxaemia) and not based solely on AKI stage or degree of renal function. Selection of RRT modality will depend on local availability and resources, as no clear benefit with any specific RRT modality is known. However, continuous therapies may be better tolerated in patients with haemodynamic instability and facilitate improved volume and nutrition management, which are important in the management of patients with COVID-19.

The dose of RRT should be based on KDIGO recommendations and be adjusted in response to changes in clinical, physiological and/or metabolic status. In patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy resulting in circuit clotting can interrupt prolonged RRT sessions and substantially affect the dose delivered. This complication of COVID-19 may require the RRT prescription to be adjusted. If CRRT is used, a reduction in the filtration fraction may reduce circuit clotting. Acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) might also be an effective option for patients who are unable to receive anticoagulants –.

The choice between jugular or femoral sites for vascular access in patients with COVID-19 is based on the experience and preference of the clinician. For patients with a body mass index > 28 kg/m 2, internal jugular (IJ) sites have lowest infection rates. Higher rates of vascular access dysfunction have been observed with the use of the left IJ, compared with the right IJ or femoral sites, but many cases of left IJ access dysfunction probably result from the inadequate depth of the catheter tip at the left IJ site. The use of ultrasound for the placement of IJ vascular access increases the likelihood of successful catheter placement, with reduced complications and time required for the procedure.

Anticoagulation strategies

What is the optimal anticoagulation strategy for acute RRT in COVID-19 AKI?

Recommendations

We recommend that patients with COVID-19 AKI receive anticoagulation agents during extracorporeal RRT (evidence level: 1C).
We suggest RRT that circuit performance be closely monitored to ensure maximal circuit patency as the initial anticoagulation strategy may not be effective in all patients; we also recommend that each centre establish a stepwise escalation and/or alternative plans for RRT anticoagulation (evidence level: 2C).
