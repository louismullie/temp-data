## Question

On DoseSpot, if a patient reports an allergy to MRI contrast dye, what allergen should be entered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what allergen should be entered in DoseSpot when a patient reports an allergy to "MRI contrast dye". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "MRI contrast dye" refers to in clinical practice. Then, I should verify whether a specific agent name is available versus only a class description. Next, I will consider cross-reactivity and the role of allergological evaluation to guide safe alternatives. After that, I need to determine the optimal allergen label when specificity is limited and what reaction details must be captured. Finally, I should align the recommendation with FDA labeling language and consensus allergy guidance to ensure the entry triggers appropriate alerts and supports future care.

> Let me first confirm what "MRI contrast dye" clinically means, and I should not conflate this with iodinated contrast used for CT; MRI contrast in routine practice is a gadolinium-based contrast agent, and hypersensitivity to these agents, while uncommon, is recognized in FDA labeling and requires preparedness for immediate treatment and observation for both immediate and delayed reactions [^114UcYux] [^113vzVQF].

> Wait, let me verify whether a specific GBCA name can be identified, because precision matters; common agents include gadobutrol (Gadavist), gadoterate meglumine (Clariscan), and gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance), all of which carry hypersensitivity warnings or contraindications in prior severe reactions, so if the patient recalls the culprit brand, entering that exact agent provides the highest clinical specificity and the most targeted future avoidance [^114UcYux] [^113vzVQF] [^112excdm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about class-wide avoidance without considering cross-reactivity and allergy workup; prospective data from the French CIRTACI study show that a substantial subset of immediate GBCA reactions are allergic with documented cross-reactivity between agents, and radiology–allergy frameworks increasingly advocate allergological evaluation with skin testing and, when necessary, drug provocation to identify a safe alternative rather than relying solely on premedication or empirical switching [^112GX7Pj] [^113UNrGs].

> I need to check what to do when the specific product is unknown; in that situation, documenting the drug class "gadolinium-based contrast agents" is appropriate because labeling and guidelines treat GBCAs as a pharmacologic class, cross-reactivity within the class can occur, and class-level entries will trigger relevant safety alerts; moreover, Multihance is formally contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to GBCAs, underscoring the relevance of the class terminology for clinical decision support [^114vvrA8] [^112excdm].

> Let me think about the key reaction details we must capture to make the allergy entry clinically actionable; I should confirm whether the reaction was immediate versus delayed, document timing relative to injection, characterize severity and organ systems involved, and differentiate allergic-type events from vasovagal or physiologic reactions, because GBCA reactions often occur within minutes and can be delayed, and distinguishing features such as tachycardia and hypotension in anaphylaxis versus bradycardia in vasovagal events materially affect risk stratification and future planning [^114UcYux] [^117Cr58C] [^115bymsD].

> I should double-check management implications for future imaging, since this influences how we label the allergy; evidence suggests premedication has limited or no effectiveness in preventing repeated GBCA reactions, whereas selection of an alternative agent guided by allergological analysis is more effective, and consensus guidance emphasizes balancing premedication, product avoidance, and preparation with resuscitation readiness when re-exposure is unavoidable [^112QzxRj] [^113UNrGs] [^1125aEMM].

> But wait, what if the initial history is vague or the index event might not have been due to the contrast itself; I should verify for potential alternative culprits or mimics because not every apparent contrast reaction is contrast-mediated, and when uncertainty persists, referral for allergy evaluation can help clarify causality and safe options [^113hxSXJ] [^113UNrGs].

> Final recommendation, and let me be precise here: when a patient reports an allergy to "MRI contrast dye" and the specific agent is unknown, enter "gadolinium-based contrast agents" as the allergen to ensure class-level alerts and alignment with labeling and cross-reactivity data; if the patient can identify the culprit brand, enter the exact GBCA name instead for maximal specificity, and in all cases document reaction phenotype, timing, severity, and organ involvement to guide future risk assessment and potential allergological evaluation [^112excdm] [^112GX7Pj] [^114UcYux] [^113UNrGs].

When a patient reports an allergy to MRI contrast dye, this most often reflects an allergy to **gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs)** — the standard MRI contrast agents [^111odsUc]. The reaction is typically to the **gadolinium chelate or excipients** [^notfound] in the formulation, not to gadolinium itself. Reactions may be immediate (within 1 hour) [^113vzVQF] or delayed (hours to days) [^114UcYux] and can include anaphylaxis, urticaria, or angioedema. In DoseSpot, document the specific GBCA and reaction details to guide future imaging and avoid re-exposure to the culprit agent [^113UNrGs] [^114vvrA8].

---

## Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs)

GBCAs are the **primary MRI contrast agents**, comprising gadolinium ions chelated to ligands to reduce toxicity. They are classified by structure (**linear or macrocyclic**) [^111odsUc] and charge (**ionic or non-ionic**).

---

## Allergic reactions to GBCAs

Allergic reactions to GBCAs are **rare but potentially severe** (including anaphylaxis) [^114vvrA8] and are typically due to the **gadolinium chelate or excipients**, not gadolinium itself. Immediate reactions occur within 1 hour [^114UcYux] and include **anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension** [^113vzVQF], whereas delayed reactions occur hours to days later [^1133cNqn] and include **rash, pruritus, and mild systemic symptoms**.

---

## Specific GBCAs associated with allergic reactions

Several GBCAs have **documented allergic reactions**:

| **GBCA** | **Documented allergic reactions** |
|-|-|
| Gadobutrol (Gadavist) | - Anaphylaxis [^114UcYux] <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Bronchospasm <br/> - Hypotension |
| Gadoterate meglumine (Clariscan) | - Anaphylaxis [^113vzVQF] <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Bronchospasm <br/> - Hypotension |
| Gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance) | - Anaphylaxis [^112excdm] <br/> - Urticaria [^112nsUzK] <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Bronchospasm <br/> - Hypotension |

---

## Excipients and additives in GBCAs

Excipients or additives in GBCAs may also trigger allergic reactions. Examples include **carboxymethylcellulose**, a documented allergen in contrast media [^1113Hogf], and **other excipients** such as preservatives, stabilizers, or buffering agents.

---

## Documentation on DoseSpot

When documenting an MRI contrast dye allergy in DoseSpot, **specify**:

- **Specific GBCA**: Name the agent (e.g. gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine) [^113UNrGs].
- **Reaction details**: Describe the reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema) [^117Cr58C].
- **Severity and timing**: Note severity and whether the reaction was immediate or delayed [^114UcYux].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Patients with documented GBCA allergies require **careful management**:

- **Avoidance**: Avoid the culprit GBCA [^112HVcor].
- **Premedication**: Consider corticosteroids and antihistamines for mild reactions [^1125aEMM].
- **Alternative agents**: Use non-gadolinium agents or non-contrast imaging when possible [^113RCmC6].
- **Emergency preparedness**: Ensure resuscitation equipment and trained personnel are available [^113vzVQF].

---

## Conclusion

Patients reporting MRI contrast dye allergies are typically allergic to **GBCAs**, specifically to the **gadolinium chelate or excipients**. Document the **specific agent and reaction details** in DoseSpot to guide future imaging and avoid re-exposure to the culprit agent [^114vvrA8].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory, or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have uncommonly occurred following Gadavist administration [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

	- Before Gadavist administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma, and/or allergic disorders, as these patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Gadavist. Administer Gadavist only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation.

	- Most hypersensitivity reactions to Gadavist have occurred within half an hour after administration. Delayed reactions can occur up to several days after administration. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and following Gadavist administration.

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome**: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients administered Gadavist and may be characterized by severe hypoxemia requiring oxygen support and mechanical ventilation. These manifestations may resemble an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with onset of respiratory distress within less than 30 minutes to 24 hours after Gadavist administration. For patients demonstrating respiratory distress after Gadavist administration, assess oxygen requirements and monitor for worsening respiratory function.

### Clariscan [^113vzVQF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with gadoterate meglumine, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of gadoterate meglumine administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment.

Before Clariscan administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma, and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Clariscan. Administer Clariscan only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation. During and following Clariscan administration, observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions.

### Low risk of contrast media-induced hypersensitivity reactions in all subtypes of systemic mastocytosis [^112vgVqe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) are at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (HRs). Although Hymenoptera venoms are the predominant triggers, cases of contrast media-induced HR (CMIHR) have also been reported, and prophylactic premedication is often performed. However, data from larger series are limited, and differences between indolent and advanced SM have not yet been investigated.

- **Objective**: To determine the incidence and severity of CMIHR in all subtypes of SM.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 162 adult patients with SM (indolent systemic mastocytosis [ISM], n = 65; advanced systemic mastocytosis [advSM], n = 97). First, the cumulative incidence of CMIHR was retrospectively assessed in the patient's history. Second, at our institution, patients underwent 332 contrast media (CM)-enhanced imaging, including 80 computed tomography (CT) scans with iodine-based contrast agents and 252 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with a gadolinium-based contrast agent, and tolerance was assessed.

- **Results**: Previous CMIHRs to CT (vomiting, n = 1; erythema, n = 1; cardiovascular shock, n = 1) and MRI (dyspnea, n = 1; cardiovascular shock, n = 1) had been reported by 4 out of 162 (2.5%) patients (ISM, n = 3; advSM, n = 1). In contrast, during or after 332 CM-enhanced CT or MRI examinations at our institution, no CMIHRs were reported. Premedication was solely given to 3 patients before CT scans, including 1 with previous CMIHR, who tolerated the imaging well.

- **Conclusion**: We conclude that there is a substantial discrepancy between the perception and prevalence of HRs.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^114uWdNy]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are generally considered to be safer than iodinated contrast agents; however, with increasing use of gadolinium-based contrast media in clinical settings, the number of reports on acute adverse reactions associated with their use is increasing. Severe anaphylactic reactions following the administration of gadolinium-based MR contrast media are extremely rare. According to Jung and others, the incidence of anaphylaxis after injecting gadolinium contrast medium was approximately 0.008%, and the mortality rate due to gadolinium contrast-induced anaphylaxis ranged from 0.0007% to 0.0019%.

In addition, it has been reported that these immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur more frequently in women than in men; however, the severity is higher in men. Patients who have asthma or other allergic diseases face an increased risk of immediate hypersensitivity when they are exposed to contrast media multiple times. According to Ahn and Kang et al, the recurrence rate was 15–30% in patients with a history of hypersensitivity. The frequency of recurrence can be reduced by administering a different type of gadolinium-based contrast agent or by implementing premedication. Various methods are employed to predict and prevent recurrence or occurrence, including corticosteroid or antihistamine premedication, skin-prick tests, drug provocation tests, and switching medications. Although studies focusing exclusively on anaphylactic reactions in pediatric patients are scarce, a few studies have explored this area.

### Delayed adverse reaction to nonionic contrast agents [^116JAEji]. Pediatric Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Delayed reactions to nonionic contrast agents are not well known. We describe a child with a life-threatening reaction.

- **Conclusions**: (1) Late adverse contrast reactions can follow nonionic contrast administration without any immediate reaction; (2) the manifestations may be unusual, with symptoms not typically associated with a contrast reaction; (3) the reactions are most often self-limiting and minor, but can be serious; (4) the protective effect of steroid pretreatment, especially same-day intravenous therapy, is uncertain.

### Anaphylactic reaction to intralesional corticosteroid injection [^1113Hogf]. Contact Dermatitis (2007). Low credibility.

We report the case of an anaphylactic reaction to carboxymethylcellulose, a dispersant in corticosteroid preparation and contrast media. Skin prick testing in this patient revealed a positive response to carboxymethylcellulose at a dilution of 1/1000. Anaphylaxis secondary to carboxymethylcellulose has previously been reported. To avoid further problems, this patient was advised to alert medical staff to the presence of an allergy to carboxymethylcellulose in the event of the need for further interventional procedures. Care should be taken when giving intradermal steroids to patients with a history of anaphylaxis after contrast media.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^115bymsD]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

When hypotension occurs as an acute adverse reaction to contrast agents, it is necessary to differentiate between anaphylaxis and vasovagal reactions. Most vasovagal reactions are mild and self-limiting; thus, close patient observation is recommended until symptoms subside. Vasovagal reactions are characterized by a slow heart rate with generally normal or slightly decreased respiration. They often occur immediately after or during contrast agent injection and might be associated with patient anxiety. Patients present with overall pallor, coolness of the skin, and occasionally diaphoresis.

On the other hand, anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that occurs systemically, affecting multiple organs within a short period of time. Without appropriate treatment, it can be life-threatening. Anaphylaxis is characterized by an increased heart rate and a weak pulse felt in both peripheral and carotid arteries. It may be accompanied by dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate. It can occur immediately after injection, during injection, or within minutes after injection. In rare cases, delayed anaphylaxis shock may occur hours after injecting the contrast medium.

### Assessment of first-time and repeated acute adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MRI: A retrospective study [^112QzxRj]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA)-related and patient-related risk factors for acute adverse reactions (AARs) and to examine the incidence and severity of repeated AARs.

Methods involved a retrospective evaluation of all intravenous GBCA injections in MRI studies at a single institution from January 2012 to September 2019. First-time AARs in patients without a past history of AARs and risk factors were assessed using multivariable regression models with generalized estimating equations. For patients with a past history of AAR(s), the incidence of repeated AARs was evaluated using Fisher's exact test, along with the severity of these repeated AARs.

Results showed that first-time AARs occurred in 129 of 41,827 GBCA injections (0.31%; 0.70% of 18,431 patients). With gadoterate meglumine as the reference, the odds ratio (OR) for allergic-like reactions to three GBCAs ranged from 3.27 to 8.03 (p = 0.012 to < 0.001). For chemotoxic reactions, the OR was 3.75 (p = 0.001) for gadoteridol. Outpatients had a lower OR for chemotoxic reactions, while higher ORs were observed in head/neck and breast MRI (p < 0.05). The OR for age was 0.99 (p < 0.05). Patients with a past history of AAR(s) had a 3.6% incidence of mild repeated AARs for all GBCA, significantly higher than the 0.31% in first-time AARs (p < 0.001). No effectiveness was found for steroid premedication.

In conclusion, the occurrence of first-time AARs was related to the GBCA used and other factors. The incidence of repeated AARs was higher than first-time AARs, though all were mild in severity.

### Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium and given iodinated contrast during an interventional pain procedure [^113WbAVS]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium, iodinated contrast medium is avoided, or antihistamine and steroid premedication are given, or a gadolinium-based contrast agent is employed. Six patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to iodinated contrast medium who were not premedicated had an unintentional injection of iodinated contrast. None of the patients developed a moderate or severe reaction. All patients had gadopentetate dimeglumine in one of their injections, and three had repeated injections of the gadopentetate.

The lack of a significant reaction may be due to any or all of the following: questionable history of an iodinated contrast reaction, a low dose of iodinated contrast given, concomitant injection of (epidural) steroid, and slower absorption from an epidural compared with an intravenous injection. While it is reassuring to know that there is a low possibility of a moderate to severe reaction in these patients, every effort should be made to avoid this scenario. Appropriate drugs and resuscitation equipment should be immediately available, and the patients should be observed adequately and followed for the possibility of late reactions. Recent publications have called for caution in the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^112GX7Pj]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). High credibility.

- **Patients with non-allergic reactions (Group Non-Allergic)**: Group Non-Allergic consisted of 152 patients (69 male; ICM: 134; GBCM: 18). A history of allergy was reported in 51 cases (33.6%) with rhinitis in 33, drug allergies in 27, food allergies in 14, and other allergies in 23 cases. Asthma was reported in 6 patients. Thirteen patients reacted despite pretreatment with anti-H1 in 1, corticosteroids in 3, both in 1, and anxiolytics in 8 cases. One hundred and six patients had undergone previous contrast procedures, and 20 had previously reacted, with 4 reacting to the culprit CM. No significant differences were observed between Group Allergic and Group Non-Allergic regarding gender, age, BMI, history of allergy or asthma, name of administered CM, pretreatment, or previous CM administration. Previous CM reactions were more frequent in Group Non-Allergic (p = 0.0026). The severity grade was lower in Group Non-Allergic than in Group Allergic (p < 0.0001) and the reaction delay was longer (11.6 versus 5.6 min; p < 0.001).

- **Signs and symptoms**: Cutaneous/mucous signs were present in 143 patients (94.1%); respiratory signs in 48 (31.6%); cardiovascular signs in 23 (15.1%), and digestive signs in 15 (9.9%). In most patients, only one category of signs was present (63.2%). Eighteen patients had increased tryptase concentrations (12.6% of 143 tested) and 35 had increased histamine levels (24.1% of 145 tested). Histamine and tryptase concentrations were significantly lower than in Group Allergic (p < 0.0001).

Skin cross-reactivity was negative in all patients with diluted CM but positive in 13 (8.6%) with pure solutions.

### Skin testing in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media - a European multicenter study [^112mTT19]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Iodinated contrast media cause both immediate and nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of skin tests in patients who have experienced such reactions.

- **Methods**: Skin prick, intradermal, and patch tests with a series of contrast media were conducted in 220 patients with either immediate or nonimmediate reactions. Positive skin tests were defined according to internationally accepted guidelines. Seventy-one never-exposed subjects and 11 subjects who had tolerated contrast medium exposure served as negative controls.

- **Results**: Skin test specificity was 96–100%. For tests conducted within the time period from 2 to 6 months after the reaction, up to 50% of immediate reactors and up to 47% of nonimmediate reactors were skin test positive. For immediate reactors, the intradermal tests were the most sensitive, whereas delayed intradermal tests in combination with patch tests were needed for optimal sensitivity in nonimmediate reactors. Contrast medium cross-reactivity was more common in the nonimmediate than in the immediate group. Interestingly, 49% of immediate and 52% of nonimmediate symptoms occurred in previously unexposed patients. Many of these patients were skin test positive, indicating that they were already sensitized at the time of first contrast medium exposure.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that at least 50% of hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media are caused by an immunological mechanism. Skin testing appears to be a useful tool for diagnosis of contrast medium hypersensitivity reactions.

### Insight into the dynamic of gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) hypersensitivity: Acquisition, persistence and disappearance [^114eoGwA]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis against gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been reported in all severity grades but is less frequent than hypersensitivity or allergy against iodinated contrast materials. Once a patient acquires such an adverse reaction, a life-long premedication is usually the consequence in concert with GBCA-enhanced MR-imaging procedures. The usefulness of this prophylaxis has been questioned and discussed controversially in the past. The case presented herein may shed some light on the dynamics of contrast-medium-induced hypersensitivity reactions.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^114yazkg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used tests in orthopedic areas. Gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are commonly used for MRI tests. They are known to be safe with few side effects and low incidence of acute adverse reactions. Although not common, immediate hypersensitivity reactions can occur in some patients after administration of gadolinium-based MR contrast media, causing skin rash, vascular edema, dyspnea, abdominal pain, hypotension, altered mental status, cardiopulmonary arrest, and even death. During a knee joint MRI test in a 5-year-old boy, anaphylaxis, a serious symptom, occurred after injecting gadolinium-based MR contrast medium. Here we report this case along with a literature review.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^116huAUU]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media (CM) are rare events but can be potentially harmful and even lead to death. The clinical identification of such reactions and the elucidation of their mechanisms, whether allergic or non-allergic, are important to ensure safe future radiological procedures. Using recommended skin testing in 245 patients with immediate hypersensitivity (IH) reactions, we identified 51 patients with allergic reactions to the administered CM. Cardiovascular signs were significantly associated with allergic IH, confirming previous reports, whereas urticaria and bronchospasm were associated with non-allergic IH, contrasting with another report. Among the 51 CM allergic patients, 16 exhibited skin cross-reactivity to one or more other CM. All CM eliciting positive skin tests should be definitively avoided in future procedures. Cross-reactivity between CM explains the increased risk of recurrence of reaction when the responsible CM is the only contraindicated one.

Reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) have been a concern to radiologists for several decades, and despite the use of non-ionic ICM, severe and fatal reactions still occur. Gadobutrol contrast media (GBCM) was first considered safe but appears to also elicit IH reactions. Our results reveal that in terms of the likelihood of an allergic reaction and the severity of the reaction, ICM and GBCM are comparable. We identified 36 cases of reactions to GBCM, compared with 209 reactions to ICM. The ratio of GBCM/ICM reactions was 0.17, which is not dissimilar to the 0.27 market-share ratio in France during the time of the study. We found no differences between ICM in terms of reaction frequency or severity.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^114NHcqY]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Group Allergic consisted of 51 patients (28 male; ICM: 41; GBCM: 10). Eight out of the ten ICM and four out of the five GBCM used in France were involved. Fifteen (29.4%) patients described a previous history of allergy (rhinitis: 15; drug: 4; food: 3; other: 11) and 3 of asthma. Three patients (5.9%) reacted despite pretreatment (anxiolytics: 2; missing data: 1), and 20 (39.3%) had never previously received CM.

- **Cutaneous/mucous signs**: Present in 44 patients (86.3%).
- **Cardiovascular signs**: Found in 33 patients (64.7%).
- **Respiratory signs**: Noted in 25 patients (49.0%).
- **Digestive signs**: Occurred in 12 patients (23.5%).

At least two categories of signs were present in 38 patients (74.5%). Finally, 25.5% of allergic reactions were graded 1, 31.4% were graded 2, and 43.1% were graded 3 or 4 (life-threatening reactions).

### Delayed reaction following gadolinium-based contrast agent application [^1133cNqn]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Both iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, iodinated contrast media have been shown to be responsible for delayed or non-immediate reactions that occur from 1 hour up to several days following iodinated contrast medium injection. Here, we present for the first time a female patient who acquired a delayed reaction after the application of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.

### International consensus on drug allergy [^111Nksw5]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in the evaluation of contrast media allergy, the 2014 guidelines from AAAAI/ACAAI/EAACI/ICON/WAO/iCAALL recommend considering skin testing for the diagnosis of immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated radiocontrast media.

### A case of severe anaphylactic reaction after administration of diagnostic-dose ferumoxytol in a pediatric patient [^111P4psF]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

We describe a case of anaphylaxis during administration of intravenous (IV) ferumoxytol as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent in a 4-year-old patient with a complicated past medical history, including YARS genetic mutation with resultant liver failure and deceased donor liver transplantation, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. The patient was noted to have labored breathing 4 minutes after initiation of ferumoxytol infusion and was subsequently rapidly intubated and returned to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring. Anaphylactic reactions to therapeutic doses of ferumoxytol led to the issuance of a black box warning by the FDA in 2015. Adverse reactions to lower doses of ferumoxytol used in diagnostic imaging, however, are rare, and there has been a paucity of documented anaphylactic reactions in the literature.

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: Diagnosis and management of food allergy [^111jewk9]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for food allergy, more specifically with respect to component-resolved diagnostic tests, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend considering component-resolved diagnostic tests in patients with inconclusive skin prick test and specific serum IgE test results.

### Hemosuccus pancreaticus in a patient with iodine allergy: Successful diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging and treatment with transarterial embolization using carbon dioxide as the contrast medium [^114mt1Lr]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP) is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding via the pancreatic duct and duodenal papilla. Since the bleeding is usually intermittent, it often remains undetected by endoscopy. Most cases are diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or angiography, and the first-line treatment is transarterial embolization (TAE). However, in general, these modalities require a large amount of iodinated contrast medium.

Here, we report the case of a 50-year-old female with HP due to chronic pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced CT and ordinary angiography were contraindicated for her, as she was allergic to iodine. She was diagnosed with HP following gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and was successfully treated by TAE of the splenic artery with metallic coils using carbon dioxide as the contrast medium.

### Contrast media and cutaneous reactions. Part 2: Delayed hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media [^113627bC]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019).

Contrast media (CM) are an indispensable part of modern medical imaging. Adverse reactions to CM are uncommon but frequently involve cutaneous symptoms. This two-part article reviews adverse events secondary to CM that are relevant to the practicing dermatologist. Part 1 covers the classification of CM, immediate hypersensitivity reactions to CM, and the newly described condition, gadolinium deposition disease. Given that there have only been two case reports, to our knowledge, of a delayed adverse reaction to gadolinium-based CM, this second part will focus on cutaneous delayed reactions caused by iodinated CM (ICM).

Delayed hypersensitivity reactions to ICM commonly present as maculopapular exanthems, but more rarely, they can manifest as fixed drug eruptions, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug-related eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, graft-versus-host disease, vasculitis, and iododerma. Delayed reactions to ICM may be underdiagnosed, as cutaneous symptoms may be attributed to oral medications, particularly if patients are on multiple drugs.

### Differences in hypersensitivity reactions and gadolinium deposition disease/symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents: New insights based on global databases VigiBase, FAERS, and IQVIA-MIDAS [^111dWBro]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Descriptive analysis of hypersensitivity reactions in VigiBase shows the number of cases for different gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in descending order: gadobutrol (n = 9454), gadoterate meglumine (n = 6489), gadopentetate dimeglumine (n = 5160), gadobenate dimeglumine (n = 3653), gadoteridol (n = 2997), gadoxetate disodium (n = 1250), gadodiamide (n = 1064), and gadoversetamide (n = 323). Except for gadoxetate disodium, all GBCAs were reported more frequently by females than males. Reports were primarily concentrated among patients aged 18–64 years.

- **Regional differences**: The primary regions for reporting varied, with gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, and gadoversetamide reported predominantly from the Americas. Gadoxetate disodium and gadobutrol were reported mainly from Asia, while gadoterate meglumine and gadoteridol were reported primarily from Europe.

- **Annual reporting rates**: The rates for individual GBCAs were unstable from 2008 to 2022. Gadoxetate disodium had the lowest reported rate of serious events (4.0%), while gadobenate dimeglumine had the highest (22.91%).

### MR lumbar discography with intradiscal gadolinium in patients with severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated contrast material [^116z9nRW]. Pain Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe our experience using discography with intradiscal gadolinium and MR lumbar discography in patients with a history of severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated radiocontrast agents.

- **Design**: Observational study of 14 patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 1999, 14 patients were referred for lumbar discography with intradiscal gadolinium followed by MRI. Patients with a history of a severe anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated radiocontrast media or those who refused the use of iodinated contrast material were included in the study.

- **Results**: In fourteen patients, 58 discs were studied. The post-discography MRIs identified seven annular tears and seven annular fissures. None of the fourteen patients reported symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction either during or after discography.

- **Conclusions**: Discography using intradiscal administration of gadolinium followed by MRI provides a method of obtaining a clinically pertinent study in a subset of patients who likely would not be offered the procedure, secondary to severe anaphylactoid reactions to iodinated contrast materials.

### Adverse allergic reactions to linear ionic gadolinium-based contrast agents: Experience with 194,400 injections [^112nsUzK]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To report the authors' experience with the administration of four gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), namely gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadofosveset trisodium, gadoxetate disodium, and gadobenate dimeglumine, in a large study population at a single, large academic medical center.

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study in which data in the electronic incident reporting system were searched. A total of 194,400 intravenous administrations of linear ionic GBCAs were assessed for the incidence of adverse reactions and risk factors from January 1, 2007, to January 14, 2014. The severity of reactions (mild, moderate, and severe), patient type (outpatients, inpatients, and emergency), examination type, and treatment options were also investigated.

In total, 204 out of 194,400 (0.1%) patients (mean age 45.7 ± 14.9 years) exhibited adverse reactions. These consisted of 6 out of 746 (0.80%) for gadofosveset trisodium, 10 out of 3,200 (0.31%) for gadoxetate disodium, 14 out of 6,236 (0.22%) for gadobenate dimeglumine, and 174 out of 184,218 (0.09%) for gadopentetate dimeglumine. A significant overall difference was found between the different GBCAs regarding the total number of reactions (p < 0.0001). When comparing the GBCAs, significant differences were found between gadofosveset trisodium versus gadopentetate dimeglumine (p < 0.0001), gadofosveset trisodium versus gadobenate dimeglumine (p = 0.0051), gadoxetate disodium versus gadopentetate dimeglumine (p < 0.0001), and gadopentetate dimeglumine versus gadobenate dimeglumine (p = 0.0013).

### A stroke imaging protocol in patients with a history of contrast-induced anaphylaxis [^112MUAP8]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The need for emergent, contrast-enhanced neuroimaging in stroke patients with a history of severe reaction to iodinated contrast represents a unique dilemma in emergency departments. There is currently a lack of evidence-based management protocols for these cases. We describe a protocol established at our institution, based on American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines and institutional experience, to guide decision-making in these scenarios.

### Severe allergic reaction to contrast dye during emergent coronary angiogram [^115CHeZp]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

We present a case of a middle-aged woman with an extensive history of adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) despite premedication. The patient presented from an outside hospital with an ST elevation myocardial infarction in the inferior and anterior leads. She received thrombolytics and was transferred to our hospital. Due to persistent chest pain and ST elevations consistent with failure of reperfusion with thrombolytics, we elected to pursue emergent catheterization. Despite administration of intravenous glucocorticoid and diphenhydramine at our hospital, the patient had an anaphylactoid reaction during the procedure that was refractory to epinephrine and required intubation and pressor support.

We suspect that earlier administration of premedication, especially glucocorticoids, prior to transfer may have improved our patient's outcome. This case report highlights the importance of vigilance in considering anaphylaxis and the potential role of early administration of premedication in patients with previous ICM reactions to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.

### Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair in patients with renal dysfunction or severe contrast allergy: Utility of imaging modalities without iodinated contrast [^117KLxvJ]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced imaging studies are required for preoperative evaluation in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair; however, the use of iodinated contrast agents may not be suitable in patients with renal dysfunction or severe contrast allergy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of imaging modalities without iodinated contrast in these patients.

A total of 297 patients underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a 6-year period ending in August 2001. Among them, 20 patients (6.2%) who underwent imaging studies without iodinated contrast because of either renal dysfunction or severe contrast allergy formed the basis of this study. Multiple non-iodinated contrast imaging studies were used, including gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), non-contrast computed tomography (CT), gadolinium or carbon dioxide (CO2) aortography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

Hospital records were reviewed to evaluate the imaging study, renal function, perioperative morbidity, and clinical outcome of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. From the results of our study, we concluded that endovascular aortic aneurysm repair can be performed safely in patients with renal dysfunction or severe contrast allergy utilizing non-iodinated contrast-based imaging modalities. IVUS is a useful intraoperative imaging modality, and postoperative endoleak surveillance can be performed using duplex ultrasound scanning to avoid the risk of iodinated contrast exposure.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^114e3fu1]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Other reports identified allergic immediate hypersensitivity (IH) in 5% to 80% of patients reacting to iodinated contrast media (ICM), compared with our finding of 19.6%. Several reasons may account for this variability, such as the type of clinical sign(s) being assessed and the severity of the reaction, or the delay between the reaction and skin tests to ascertain positivity. In our study, we recruited all the patients during the reaction, whereas previous studies recruited patients at the time of skin testing. Thus, the present cohort is homogeneous, the culprit contrast media (CM) is known, and the clinical presentations are well-characterized, allowing exclusion of adverse events unrelated to IH. This contrasts with studies that included retrospective cases or cases with unknown culprits.

Skin test positivity declines with the time elapsed after the reaction, so we performed skin tests within six months of the reaction to enhance reliability. In the present study, grade 1 reactions (cutaneous/mucous reactions) were the most frequent, occurring in 55.9% of patients, and appeared allergic in only 9.5% of cases. Conversely, life-threatening reactions or cardiac arrest were rare (13.9% and 1.6%, respectively) and were diagnosed as allergic IH in 52.9% and 100% of cases, respectively. Thus, recruitment bias may account for the wide range of percentages of allergic IH, especially in patients recruited at skin testing, as patients with severe reactions are more prone to come for investigation than those with minor ones.

Concerning gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM), we identified allergy in 27.8% of reactions, whereas other authors reported only a few clinical cases. This much higher number was found in a prospective study.

### Hypersensitivity reactions after diagnostic nonvascular administration of iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents and the role of the drug allergy specialist [^113H7GZJ]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The risk of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) following the nonvascular administration of contrast media (CM) for diagnostic studies is very low, likely due to minimal absorption into the systemic circulation. Most published individual cases of HSR after nonvascular CM administration are immediate reactions caused by ionic high-osmolar CM, a few by nonionic low-osmolar CM, and none by gadolinium-based contrast agents. Measures to prevent reHSR following nonvascular administration are similar to those recommended to prevent HSR after intravascular CM administration.

Premedication as a preventive measure has been abandoned, while switching to an alternative CM, preferably based on the results of an allergological analysis, is increasingly advocated. In selected scenarios, preventive measures may be minimized.

### The use of gadolinium in patients with contrast allergy or renal failure requiring coronary angiography, coronary intervention, or vascular procedure [^113Nrniy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery angiography remains an important procedure for the assessment of coronary arteries. It requires the injection of iodinated contrast for the opacification of coronary arteries. Severe allergy to iodine contrast and renal insufficiency are two main problems associated with iodine-based contrast media. Gadolinium (Gd) has a different chemical structure and does not exhibit cross-reactivity with iodine-based contrast media in patients with iodine allergy. The use of Gd is commonly employed in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for image enhancement, making it a potential alternative in patients for whom iodine is contraindicated. The aim of this manuscript is to review the available literature on the use of Gd in patients contraindicated to iodine contrast due to allergy or in patients with severe renal failure who require coronary or vascular procedures.

### What looks like a contrast reaction may not be a contrast reaction [^113hxSXJ]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions following the application of a contrast medium are always a challenge for radiologists. At the time of writing, little consideration has been given to causality analyses. Hypersensitivity reactions in the context of contrast-enhanced imaging procedures may be caused by the contrast agent, but other culprit agents, such as latex allergy, should also be considered.

### Acute non-hypersensitivity adverse reactions following intravascular administration of contrast agents in adult patients [^116T27Lw]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Acute adverse drug reactions (ADR) to contrast agents have historically been divided into Type A (toxic/physiologic) reactions and Type B (hypersensitivity) reactions. Acute Type A adverse reactions are relatively uncommon after administration of iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents and are rare after ultrasound contrast agents. Most acute Type A reactions are transient, mild, and of limited clinical consequence. Across all types of contrast agent (CA) classes, nausea and vomiting are the most frequently reported Type A reactions. In most cases, these reactions are caused by chemotoxicity and/or hyperosmolarity. Management of mild to moderate Type A reactions to contrast agents is often symptomatic and supportive; however, more severe Type A reactions need specialist treatment. We critically examined acute Type A ADR and nonspecific reactions following CA administration (labeled "physiologic" in the American College of Radiology classification) and propose a classification into three reaction types: acute non-hypersensitivity ADR, delayed Type A ADR, and Type B (hypersensitivity) ADR. This can facilitate accurate assessment and reporting of ADR to contrast agents.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions. Image interpretation risks in lung ventilation studies may arise if proximal airway deposition is observed; consider additional diagnostic options in such cases. Technetium Tc 99m pentetate contributes to a patient's overall long-term radiation exposure. Inhalation of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate solution may result in acute bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with heightened bronchoreactivity.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions and ensure access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel.

- **Image interpretation risks in lung ventilation studies**: In patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, there may be deposition of particles in the proximal airways, influencing image quality and interfering with diagnostic interpretation. To ensure diagnostic quality, careful use of the nebulizer to assure optimal particle delivery is essential. If interfering particle deposition occurs, consider additional diagnostic options.

- **Radiation exposure risk**: Technetium Tc 99m contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure.

### Immediate reactions following iodinated contrast media injection: a study of 38 cases [^113n6tr5]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

To investigate the pathomechanisms involved in cases of immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurring after the administration of iodinated contrast media, patients who presented clinical signs of immediate hypersensitivity suggesting an allergy after receiving iodinated contrast medium were investigated. Histamine and tryptase concentrations were measured, and skin tests were performed when applicable. Patients with positive skin tests to the culprit contrast agent were classified as having IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity (Group I), while those with negative skin tests were classified as having non-allergic hypersensitivity (Group II).

A total of 38 patients were included in this study. Most reactions appeared after non-ionic procedures (n = 32). Reactions were more frequently severe following ionic procedures than non-ionic ones (p = 0.014). Skin testing was not performed in 11 patients. Among those tested, skin tests with the culprit contrast agent were negative in 26% of the patients (Group II, n = 7), while they were positive in 73% of the patients (Group I, n = 19). A latex-induced reaction was diagnosed in one patient, who was subsequently excluded from the cohort. In Group I, the frequency of cross-reactivity with other commercialized iodinated contrast media was low (7%). Cardiovascular signs were present in Group I (52.6%, n = 10) and absent in Group II (p = 0.023). Histamine and tryptase concentrations were higher in patients who exhibited cardiovascular signs (p < 0.02).

The study highlights that immediate reactions with clinical signs suggesting allergy, along with positive skin tests, were associated with the administered contrast agent.

### A practical guide to diagnose lesser-known immediate and delayed contrast media-induced adverse cutaneous reactions [^115NDcZD]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The terms "immediate" and "delayed" adverse reactions induced by contrast media (CM) refer to the reactions' onset but do not provide substantial information concerning the clinical manifestation, the potential risk factors, the treatment modalities, or prevention. Because a variety of different reactions caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms may arise immediately or be delayed after CM injection, and because these need different management, the aim of the present paper is to present the clinical features and to exactly characterize lesser-known cutaneous reactions. A thorough knowledge of the clinical features, their adequate treatment, and, possibly, the subsequent diagnostic procedure for preventing recurrence after reexposure to CM would improve patient management.

### Clinical follow-up in patients with moderate or severe allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast material [^113RCmC6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine follow-up care in patients with a history of acute allergic-like reaction to iodinated contrast material (ICM), including subsequent imaging management, allergy consultation, and repeat ICM exposure and reactions.

All patients who had a moderate or severe acute allergic-like reaction to ICM after contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) examination from June 1, 2009, to January 1, 2022, at our institution were included. Chart review was performed to determine if subsequent imaging was altered or not performed, if the patient underwent a subsequent CECT examination, and whether they had an allergist consultation.

A total of 251 patients were identified. One-third of patients (90 of 251, 36%) experienced at least one change to their subsequent imaging management due to their reaction. This included opting for an unenhanced CT (62 of 251, 25%) or MRI (22 of 251, 8.8%) instead of a CECT, or not performing a CECT when clinically indicated (20 of 251, 8.0%). Patients with a prior severe reaction were more likely to experience a change in management than those with a prior moderate reaction (severe: 22 of 32 [69%] versus moderate: 68 of 219 [31%], P < .0001).

Only 17 patients (6.8%) received an allergy consult for their ICM reaction. A total of 90 patients underwent 274 subsequent CECT examinations. Repeat allergic-like reactions were observed in one quarter of patients (24 of 90, 27%) and in a tenth of CECT examinations (29 of 274, 11%).

In conclusion, one-third of patients with a history of a moderate or severe allergic-like reaction to ICM had alterations in their subsequent imaging management.

### Allergological evaluation of hypersensitivity reactions after administration of contrast agents: What the radiologist needs to know [^113UNrGs]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

To familiarize radiologists with the methodology used in the assessment and management of hypersensitivity reactions to contrast agents.

- **Objective**: To familiarize radiologists with the methodology used in the assessment and management of hypersensitivity reactions to contrast agents.

- **Methods**: This review provides diagnostic tools for the appropriate identification of these types of reactions, including a checklist of key clinical items and a proposed algorithm to differentiate hypersensitivity reactions from nonspecific reactions and to assess their severity. It also outlines the main in vitro techniques (specific IgE, basophil activation test, mast cell activation test, lymphoblastic transformation test, and ELISpot) and in vivo procedures (skin tests and drug provocation tests) used to identify the culprit contrast agent and guide the selection of a safe alternative.

- **Results**: Although premedication is commonly used, its effectiveness is limited. Administering an alternative contrast agent is a more effective strategy, but empirical selection carries a risk of recurrence. Allergy testing enables safer selection of an alternative agent. Integrating allergy evaluation into radiological practice can improve patient safety and outcomes in patients with a history of previous reactions.

- **Conclusion**: Allergological techniques are valuable tools that support radiologists in the safe management of patients with hypersensitivity reactions to contrast agents, particularly in cases requiring re-exposure. The article concludes by presenting a diagnostic algorithm for both immediate and delayed reactions.

- **Clinical relevance statement**: Switching to an alternative contrast agent is the most effective way to prevent a new hypersensitivity reaction.

### Gadolinium as an alternative contrast agent for therapeutic ERCP in the iodine-allergic patient [^116iRpCC]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) requires an intraductal contrast agent. The contrast of choice is an iodine-based agent. The alternatives in patients with a severe allergy to iodinated contrast are limited. We undertook a retrospective review of the success and safety of gadolinium as an alternative radiocontrast agent in patients with allergy to iodine-based contrast in a series of five patients in a tertiary care pancreaticobiliary referral center.

The five patients underwent a total of six ERCP procedures using a gadolinium chelate as the radiocontrast agent. ERCP was technically successful in all cases, including pancreatic endotherapy. There were no contrast-related adverse reactions. Gadolinium is concluded to be a reasonable alternative to iodine-based ERCP contrast in selected patients. It provides inferior image quality compared to standard iodine-based contrast but was not technically limiting in our small experience.

### Contrast media extravasation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging: Management guidelines for the radiologist [^1157NRy9]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast administration has been of great importance in diagnostic radiology, but it is not without risks either due to local, systemic allergic reactions or due to subcutaneous extravasation of contrast media. Subcutaneous contrast medium extravasation is an infrequent, yet well-recognized complication. Most incidents are minor and can be managed conservatively. However, there are a few cases that require immediate surgical intervention. This article discusses the risk factors, clinical manifestations, and conservative and surgical approaches of subcutaneous contrast media extravasation for both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^114vvrA8]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast media (ICM; GBCM) induce immediate hypersensitivity (IH) reactions. Differentiating allergic from non-allergic IH is crucial; an allergy contraindicates the culprit agent for life. We studied the frequency of allergic IH among ICM or GBCM reactors.

- **Methods**: Patients were recruited in 31 hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Clinical symptoms, plasma histamine and tryptase concentrations, and skin tests were recorded. Allergic IH was diagnosed by intradermal tests (IDT) with the culprit CM diluted 1:10, "potentially allergic" IH by positive IDT with pure CM, and non-allergic IH by negative IDT.

- **Findings**: Among 245 skin-tested patients (ICM = 209; GBCM = 36), allergic IH to ICM was identified in 41 (19.6%) and to GBCM in 10 (27.8%). Skin cross-reactivity was observed in 11 patients with ICM (26.8%) and 5 with GBCM (50%). Allergy frequency increased with clinical severity and histamine and tryptase concentrations, accounting for over 50% of life-threatening cases. GBCM and ICM triggered comparable IH reactions in frequency and severity. Cross-reactivity was frequent, especially with ICM.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: A consensus statement from the American College of Radiology and the AAAAI [^1125aEMM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) is widely used in the United States. It is imperative to provide guidance on the management of adverse reactions to ICM as well as the preparation, planning, and potential premedication for patients with previous reactions. Currently, there is a discordance between the American College of Radiology Contrast Manual, which recommends premedication to prevent repeat hypersensitivity reactions to ICM, and the Anaphylaxis 2020 Practice Parameters Update, which recommends against the routine administration of glucocorticoids and/or antihistamines to prevent anaphylaxis with prior ICM hypersensitivity reactions.

A task force of experts from radiology, who are also members of the American College of Radiology Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, and expert allergists/immunologists, including members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex Committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, evaluated the scientific evidence to develop consensus recommendations endorsed by both organizations. The task force took into account the strength of evidence and balanced the potential risks of repeat reactions with those of premedication and product avoidance when making these recommendations. These efforts aim to improve and standardize the care of patients who experience or have a history of reaction to ICM.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^115jGyiF]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most widely used tests in the orthopedic field due to its excellent resolution. It can be utilized in various imaging techniques to effectively visualize not only bone tissues but also soft tissues such as nerves, ligaments, and vascular muscles. Gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are commonly used for MRI tests. They are known to be safe with a low incidence of acute adverse reactions, primarily because concentrations of gadolinium-based contrast media are significantly lower than those of osmotic nonionic iodine contrast media used in computed tomography (CT) scans.

Adverse reactions to contrast media, including iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast media, can have a wide range of clinical manifestations depending on underlying mechanisms. These reactions can be categorized into physiological reactions and hypersensitivity reactions. Their severity can be mild, moderate, or severe. Physiological reactions are primarily caused by direct chemical toxicity of iodinated contrast agents and differences in osmotic pressure. Caution is necessary as these reactions frequently occur at high doses.

A vasovagal response is commonly seen as hypotension and bradycardia caused by vagal hyperactivity. It can also be induced by stimuli such as anxiety and peripheral vascular catheterization. On the other hand, hypersensitivity reactions can occur regardless of dose, making them challenging to predict. They can be further classified into allergic reactions involving immunological mechanisms.

### Hypersensitivity reactions and contrast medium injection: Are they always related [^116Nahzk]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity (allergic or non-allergic) reactions that occur after contrast medium (CM) injection are usually related to the CM. Recent studies and case reports lack the analysis of alternate causes that could also be responsible in individual cases.

- **Patients and methods**: We investigated the individual relevant factor/causative agent of adult patients with hypersensitivity reactions that occurred in radiological units during CM-enhanced procedures (CT, angiography, urography, or MR-examinations). Both immediate and non-immediate (delayed) reactions were included. To find the relevant agent, a detailed patients' history was carefully analyzed. Additionally, the records were retrospectively reviewed, and if indicated and possible, laboratory tests (e.g. basophil activation test) and skin tests (e.g. prick) and/or provocations with CM-injections under routine conditions were performed.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients (21 males) suspected of CM-hypersensitivity reactions were identified. These reactions were mild in most cases (n = 21), moderate reactions occurred in 13 cases, and four patients had severe reactions. In 28 patients, the reactions were induced by the CM (iodinated CM in 25 cases). Four patients had reactions that were not CM-related (latex allergy, adenosine reaction, vasovagal reaction, unknown cause), and in six cases, the reaction was partly CM-related (immunological activation was present due to the patients' diseases).

- **Conclusion**: Our data support the hypothesis that in CM-enhanced procedures, not only contrast materials but also a broad range of other factors can contribute to hypersensitivity reactions.

Forty-two patients (22 men) had negative IDT with diluted solutions but positive IDT with pure solutions of CM, 34 with ICM and 8 with GBCM. A history of allergy was described by 11 patients (26.2%) (rhinitis: 6; drug: 6; food: 5; latex: 1; other: 4) and asthma by 2 (4.8%). Seven (16.7%) had been pretreated (anti-H1: 1; anti-H1 and corticosteroids: 2; anxiolytics: 3; missing data: 1). Twenty-eight had previous CM administration and 11 had previous reactions (6 with the same CM), which was more frequent than in the other groups (p < 0.01). The time delay between CM injection and reaction was intermediate between the shortest (allergic reactions) and the largest ones (non-allergic) (p = 0.001). The severity grade of the reactions was also intermediate between the two other groups (p < 0.0001).

Individual clinical signs are reported in Suppl Table 1. Tryptase concentrations were positive in 17 patients (44.7%, 38 tested), and histamine in 20 (54.1%, 37 tested). Mediator concentrations were intermediate between those observed in Groups Allergic and Non-Allergic (p < 0.0001; Fig. 3). Skin cross-reactivity with diluted CM was positive in one patient (2.4%) to two ICM. With pure solutions, positive tests were obtained in 21 patients (50.0%): 14 (41.2%) to ICM (7 to one ICM; 5 to two and 2 to three) and 7 (87.5%) to GBCM (3 to one GBCM and 4 to two). The frequency of cross-reactivity to ICM was intermediate between those of the two other groups (p < 0.001).

### Gadolinium radiologic contrast is a useful alternative for hysterosalpingography in patients with iodine allergy [^112ZsdKs]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

The objective was to report the successful use of gadolinium radiologic contrast for hysterosalpingography. This case report was set in an outpatient care, private practice setting, involving one female patient who completed the study. The intervention performed was a hysterosalpingogram.

- **Main outcome measure**: Interpretability of radiological imaging.

- **Results**: Visualization of a normal uterine cavity and fallopian tubes with bilateral patency was confirmed during the procedure. Radiologic films were created to document the results. The best visualization of the internal pelvic anatomy was noted during the actual procedure. A lighter image was noted on the films taken from the use of gadolinium rather than the traditional iodinated contrast.

- **Conclusion**: Gadolinium is a safe and useful alternative to iodinated contrast for hysterosalpingography in patients with iodine allergy.

### Shelling the myth: Allergies to iodine containing substances and risk of reaction to iodinated contrast media [^115DtPZX]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

In excess of 100 million procedures using iodinated radio-contrast media are conducted each year. There is a common misunderstanding regarding the links between allergy to iodinated substances and the risk of allergic reaction to intravenous iodinated contrast agents. These perceived risks are managed via administration of corticosteroids or avoidance of iodinated contrast altogether.

- **Methods**: An extensive review of published literature on scientific databases and international guidelines was conducted to inform the research question. A questionnaire was formulated and distributed to hospital doctors in four tertiary centers. Within this questionnaire, doctors were presented with six different scenarios of bona fide allergy to iodinated substances (e.g. shellfish) and asked to select the most suitable treatment response from three options: standard contrast scan, delay scan with pre-medication, or change to non-contrast scan.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven questionnaire responses were received. The standard contrast protocol was the most appropriate regimen for all the listed allergies. This was identified correctly as follows: 76% for kiwi, 69% for fish, 44% for poly-food, 32% for shellfish, 18% for Betadine, and 14% for tincture of iodine allergies.

- **Conclusions**: There is a lack of understanding among local junior medical staff regarding the administration of iodinated contrast media to patients with a history of allergy to iodinated substances. These misconceptions may lead to the unnecessary use of pre-medication.

### Controversies in drug allergy: Radiographic contrast media [^115M7Kdd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

The risk for developing immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media (RCM) interferes with the diagnosis and treatment of numerous patients requiring imaging diagnostic methods for many common diseases. A group of experts met in Orlando, Florida, in March 2018 to analyze the similarities and differences in the management of RCM reactions across different regions of the world. This paper presents a summary of the recommendations provided by this consensus group, highlighting controversial issues and unmet needs that require further research.

Rarely, severe allergic reactions of an anaphylactoid nature have been reported following the administration of barium sulfate contrast agents. Appropriate facilities and trained personnel should be available for emergency treatment of severe reactions and should remain available for at least 30 to 60 minutes following administration, since delayed reactions can occur.

Warnings

Severe sensitivity reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a personal or family history of bronchial asthma, significant allergies, or previous reactions to contrast agents.

A history of sensitivity to iodine per se or to other contrast agents is not an absolute contraindication to the use of diatrizoate meglumine but calls for extreme caution in administration.

### Risk of hypersensitivity reactions to iopromide after intra-arterial versus intravenous administration: A nested case-control analysis of 133,331 patients [^115U3Tts]. Investigative Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Iopromide (Ultravist) is a low osmolar nonionic contrast medium containing iodine, which causes x-ray attenuation in computed tomography (CT) examinations. Iopromide has been used for contrast-enhanced CT and other radiographic procedures since 1985. As of July 2018, approximately 260 million doses (≈16 million doses/year) have been administered to patients in more than 100 countries. The overall safety has been proven in numerous studies.

Although the overall safety profile of iopromide and other nonionic/low osmolar iodine-based contrast media (IBCM) is well understood, there is continuous discussion pertaining to the nature of hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions, also called "immediate hypersensitivity reactions", "allergy-like reactions", "allergic-like reactions", "anaphylactoid reactions", "idiosyncratic", or "nonallergic contrast material–induced hypersensitivity, non–IgE-mediated allergy", are unpredictable and potentially very severe or even lethal.

The majority of published studies investigated overall safety data on procedures with intravenous (IV) contrast administration. However, there is some evidence indicating that IV and intra-arterial (IA) administration might have different safety profiles. Such differences in the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been published by a few authors. To the best of our knowledge, no study specifically focuses on clinically relevant hypersensitivity reactions after IV versus IA administration.

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^116p6UWT]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Knee radiograph showing a slight elevation of cortical bone inside the distal femur indicated by an arrow.

Knee MRI was performed at this hospital using a contrast medium (solution. Gadovist, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany, 3 mg). The patient underwent knee MRI while being conscious and accompanied by his mother. He did not receive any sedatives. Ten minutes after injecting the contrast medium, the child complained of symptoms of dizziness and lethargy. Thirty minutes later, he complained of severe dizziness, abdominal pain, and headache. He vomited three times. He was transferred to the emergency room with suspected anaphylaxis. Upon arrival to the emergency room, he had a blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg, a pulse rate of 100 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 32, a body temperature of 36.4 °C, an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%, and a blood sugar level of 125 mg/l. Physiological saline was rapidly administered. However, there was no increase in blood pressure after 5 min. Therefore, epinephrine at a dose of 0.2 mg was injected intramuscularly.

A continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/min of dopamine was initiated at 40 min after symptom occurrence. At 65 min, a second dose of 0.2 mg of epinephrine was administrated and a transnasal humidified oxygen delivery system (Optiflow™, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) was applied with FiO2 70% at a flow rate of 20 L/min. At 75 min, a continuous infusion of norepinephrine at 0.05 mcg/kg/min was started. Chest X-ray was performed at 120 min. Three hours later, administration of methylprednisolone was started.

### Differences in hypersensitivity reactions and gadolinium deposition disease/symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents: New insights based on global databases VigiBase, FAERS, and IQVIA-MIDAS [^115fxWYy]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been used internationally for more than 35 years in hundreds of millions of patients. Although GBCAs are relatively safe, several studies have reported some adverse events (AEs) associated with GBCAs, including hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and gadolinium deposition disease/symptoms (GDD/SAGE). This study compared the safety of all GBCAs with regard to HSRs and GDD/SAGE by analyzing the global post-marketing data, providing data to support a more rational clinical management of GBCA-associated AEs.

Based on demographic information, AE reports were concentrated in the 18–64 age group, with a predominance in those aged 45 and older. This may be because middle-aged and older adults are the main population using GBCAs. AE reports on females make up the majority of HSR reports, potentially related to genetic differences between the sexes. Regarding regions, the subject countries of reported AEs varied among GBCAs, which, in combination with sales data, is mainly but not absolutely related to the usage preference of each region. For example, Asia, which has the third highest sales of gadobutrol among the three regions, reported more AEs regarding HSRs than the Americas and Europe; this may be related to genetic and ethnic factors. In our study, the frequency was lower than in previous studies, which may be due to the fact that VigiBase and FAERS are spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) that do not cover all AEs during the course of the study as in clinical randomized trials.

Allergy is one of the triggers of angioedema. In the general population, the incidence of severe allergic reactions is 0.01–0.03%. However, 46% of al

### A five-year-old boy with anaphylaxis reaction to gadolinium-based MR contrast medium: a case report [^112F8una]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Anaphylactic reactions due to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media are rare, with even lower incidence in pediatric patients. However, when they do occur, they can be life-threatening, necessitating caution. MRI tests typically have a longer test duration than CT scans. It is difficult to determine a patient's condition with an MRI because the patient and the operator are separated due to the magnetic field. Moreover, in the case of children, examinations are often conducted after sedation, making diagnosis more difficult. A monitoring device is required to immediately identify the patient's condition. The operator should always closely monitor the patient with possible side effects in mind.

Sufficient training for medical staff in the examination room is needed to take prompt action in the event of any adverse reactions. Thus, close attention is needed, and care should be taken. For this reason, it may be useful to educate not only medical staff but also patients and guardians to recognize that this condition is a fatal emergency. It is important to provide patients with documents recording anaphylaxis symptoms and methods to request medical help, as there is a possibility of recurrence.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^1173gXKm]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of allergy relies on skin testing with the culprit drug. False positive results may occur with concentrated drug solutions, and false negative results can lead to reaction recurrences. Mediator measurements in blood obtained during the reaction may be useful to ascertain the allergy diagnosis, but are not devoid of pitfalls: blood samples must be obtained within the first hour(s) of reaction because mediator half-life is short (15–20 min for histamine; 90–120 min for tryptase), and tryptase concentrations are rarely increased during mild reactions. Recent reports evaluated skin testing in patients with IH reactions to ICM, with divergent results. This may be because cases were often tested retrospectively, and mediator release was not studied.

The main goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of IH reactions to contrast media and to evaluate the frequency of allergy to CM among them. For this purpose, we conducted a prospective multicenter study in France over the last decade. Due to the rarity of severe reactions, 31 centers were needed over a 5-year period, in order to gather enough data. A large cohort of reacting patients was comprehensively evaluated, using clinical symptoms, mediator evaluation, and skin testing. Secondary goals included the study of cross-reactivity with related CM and of clinical parameters associated with allergic IH.

### Fluorescite [^117UBLsU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fluorescite® Injection 10% is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product. Rare cases of death due to anaphylaxis have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Fluorescein sodium can induce serious intolerance reactions. These reactions are always unpredictable but occur more frequently in patients who have previously experienced an adverse reaction after fluorescein injection (symptoms other than nausea and vomiting) or in those with a history of allergies such as food or drug-induced urticaria, asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis.

A detailed questioning of each patient is recommended before angiography to evaluate any prior history of allergy. Fluorescite® Injection 10% is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product (4.1).

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^1126DNJi]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

**Clinical signs associated with allergy or non-allergy**: According to diagnostic odds ratios, cardiovascular signs were highly associated with allergy, especially when cutaneous or respiratory signs were also present. Respiratory or digestive signs were less clearly associated with allergy, and cutaneous signs were not associated. When three or four different organs were affected simultaneously, allergy was highly likely. In contrast, non-allergic immediate hypersensitivity (IH) was likely when only one category of signs was present. Single cutaneous manifestations, especially isolated urticaria, indicated a high probability of a non-allergic reaction.

### Rare delayed hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions [^116M13XV]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The risk of developing a severe delayed cutaneous reaction (SCAR) is very low following iodine-based contrast medium (ICM) administration and extremely low following gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) administration. However, SCAR can be very severe and potentially life-threatening. It is crucial for the imaging physician to recognize danger signals such as bullous skin eruption, skin erosion and detachment, mucosal involvement, systemic symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities. Patients suspected of having a SCAR should be urgently referred to a drug allergy specialist or dermatologist.

To prevent recurrence, consider exploring alternative imaging modalities and avoid administering the same type of contrast medium involved: if the culprit is an ICM, avoid all ICM, and if the culprit is a GBCA, avoid all GBCA. In an allergy center with experience in SCAR evaluation, a careful allergologic analysis may be performed safely several months after the patient has recovered from SCAR. However, allergologic analysis is challenging due to the lack of reliable in vitro diagnostic tests and the risks of in vivo diagnostic tests, particularly drug provocation tests.

### Non-invasive imaging in a rare case of main pulmonary artery aneurysm [^113Sd8j8]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old female patient undergoing a pre-operative routine diagnostic had an incidental chest X-ray finding that showed a large vessel dilation at the root of the ascending aorta. Due to a prior allergic reaction to iodine contrast agent, non-invasive imaging was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This led to the diagnosis of a large aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery, which is a rare finding. Initial considerations for surgical intervention were dismissed as there were no clinical symptoms or apparent risk factors.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^115xSBXt]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Iodinated contrast media is associated with predictable nonimmune-mediated (pharmacological) reactions, as well as immediate (within 1 hour of administration) and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The incidence of reactions to iodinated contrast media, including severe, life-threatening reactions, has decreased to 0.2% to 0.7% since the use of low-osmolarity contrast agents. Most of these reactions are self-limited and mild, such as localized skin eruptions, and do not require medical intervention or premedication protocols.

Immediate reactions to iodinated contrast media have largely been considered non-IgE-mediated and, therefore, have classically been managed with pretreatment regimens that include oral corticosteroids and H1-antihistamines. However, the 2020 Anaphylaxis Practice Parameter recommends against routine corticosteroid or antihistamine administration to prevent immediate reactions in patients with a history of iodinated contrast media hypersensitivity. In addition, the routine use of corticosteroids has negative implications for patients, particularly those with active infections or diabetes. Some studies have reported a significant impact of antihistamine premedication alone (i.e. without corticosteroids) for reducing immediate reactions in those with a prior history of iodinated contrast media reaction. In one study of 196,081 patients, including 570 who had prior reactions to iodinated contrast media, premedication with antihistamine (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.86]) and switching contrast agents (OR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.73]) were associated with reduced odds of immediate reactions.

### Anaphylaxis in the radiology suite [^113R7QEJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Contrast media are crucial for modern medical imaging. While generally well tolerated, contrast agents can cause adverse reactions, which are categorized as pharmacological effects or hypersensitivity reactions. This vignette presents a patient with a past history of urticaria after radiocontrast media exposure during coronary angiography. The patient requires further evaluation for radiocontrast media due to the need for another coronary angiography. Currently, there are no validated methods to predict such reactions. The mechanisms behind adverse reactions to contrast media are not well understood. Due to the unknown contrast agent, the patient was successfully pretreated with corticosteroids and an H1 antihistamine.

### Immediate hypersensitivity to contrast agents: The French 5-year CIRTACI study [^117Cr58C]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

The reactions occurred within 15 minutes after administration of contrast material (CM) in 75% of patients. The mean delay between injection and reaction was shorter in grade 3–4 reactions (5.4 ± 4.7 minutes) than in grade 1–2 reactions (10.5 ± 10.9 minutes) (p = 0.002), with no significant difference between iodinated contrast media (ICM) or gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM) reactions (p = 0.23). The severity grade of the reaction was 1 in 137 patients, 2 in 70, 3 in 34, and 4 in 4 (2 ICM and 2 GBCM), with no difference between ICM and GBCM reactions (p = 0.23).

- **Cutaneous/mucous signs**: Present in 228 patients (93.1%).
- **Cardiovascular signs**: Observed in 67 patients (27.3%).
- **Respiratory signs**: Appeared in 88 patients (35.9%).
- **Digestive signs**: Noted in 34 patients (13.9%), but never observed alone.

Sign frequencies did not significantly differ between ICM and GBCM: cutaneous signs (p = 0.98); cardiovascular signs (p = 0.50); respiratory signs (p = 0.87); digestive signs (p = 0.19). Sixty-seven patients required prolonged hospital surveillance. All patients recovered.

### Differences in hypersensitivity reactions and gadolinium deposition disease/symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents: New insights based on global databases VigiBase, FAERS, and IQVIA-MIDAS [^111odsUc]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are chelates of gadolinium (Gd), a paramagnetic metal that induces a magnetic field to enhance tissue contrast to characterize lesions and assess perfusion and flow-related abnormalities. Since 1988, when the first GBCA was introduced to the market, there are nine GBCAs widely used in clinical practice. GBCAs can be classified into linear and macrocyclic chelates according to their chemical structure, and into ionic and nonionic according to the Gd ionic state.

As the use of GBCAs increases, understanding more specific symptomatic differences in the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) across GBCAs can provide guidance for clinical use. According to an 8-year cohort study, the incidence of HSR was 0.4%, which is lower than iodinated contrast media, but concerns remain. Clinical studies and case reports mainly focus on HSRs to GBCAs, but there are fewer studies on more specific responses to HSRs due to some limitations. Only one pharmacovigilance study analyzed data on anaphylaxis from 1988 to 2012.

In addition, it has been shown that in patients treated with GBCAs, Gd may be retained at sites, mainly in the bones and skin, with only a small amount present in the brain. The term "gadolinium deposition disease" (GDD) was first proposed by Semelka and colleagues in 2016 to describe symptoms reported by patients with normal renal function after exposure to GBCAs. Although there is still much controversy regarding GDD, the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the FDA have been using GDD as a preferred term for such cases.
