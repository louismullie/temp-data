## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the probability that, when a fair six-sided die is rolled three times, none of the following is divisible by 7: the first roll, the sum of the first two rolls, or the sum of all three rolls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total sample space and the divisibility-by-7 constraint. Then, I should verify the modular arithmetic patterns for sums modulo 7. Next, I will enumerate valid sequences by conditioning on the first roll and tracking allowed residues for the second and third rolls. After that, I will count favorable outcomes and compute the probability. Finally, I should double-check my logic and ensure the answer matches one of the provided options.

> Let me first confirm the basics. A fair die has outcomes 1 through 6, each with probability 1/6, and three rolls yield 6 × 6 × 6 = 216 equally likely sequences. I need to exclude any sequence where the first roll, the sum of the first two rolls, or the sum of all three rolls is divisible by 7, which means I should track residues modulo 7 as I build the sequence step-by-step.

> Now, I will examine the divisibility constraints modulo 7. Let the rolls be X1, X2, X3. I need X1 ≢ 0 mod 7, X1 + X2 ≢ 0 mod 7, and X1 + X2 + X3 ≢ 0 mod 7. Since die faces are 1–6, X1 is never 0 mod 7, so the first constraint is automatically satisfied. Thus, I only need to ensure that the cumulative sums after two and three rolls are not 0 mod 7, which simplifies the problem to tracking running residues and avoiding 0 at steps 2 and 3.

> Next, I should review how the sums behave modulo 7. For any first roll X1, the second roll X2 must avoid making X1 + X2 ≡ 0 mod 7, so X2 ≢ −X1 mod 7. Similarly, for the third roll, X3 must avoid making X1 + X2 + X3 ≡ 0 mod 7, so X3 ≢ −(X1 + X2) mod 7. Because die faces are 1–6, the forbidden residue for X2 or X3 will always be one of 1–6, so there are exactly 5 allowed residues out of 6 for each of those choices, conditional on the prior sum.

> Wait, let me verify the counting strategy. I initially thought to multiply 6 × 5 × 5 = 150 and conclude 150/216 = 25/36, but hold on, I should verify whether the third-roll restriction truly depends on the exact prior sum or just on the prior residue. The constraint X3 ≢ −(X1 + X2) mod 7 depends only on the current cumulative residue, not the specific prior rolls, so the 5/6 factor for X3 is correct given the residue after two rolls, and the multiplication 6 × 5 × 5 is indeed appropriate here.

> I will now examine the calculation explicitly. Total sequences: 6 × 6 × 6 = 216. For each of the 6 possible first rolls, there are 5 valid second rolls that avoid making the two-roll sum ≡ 0 mod 7, and for each of those 30 pairs, there are 5 valid third rolls that avoid making the three-roll sum ≡ 0 mod 7, giving 6 × 5 × 5 = 150 favorable sequences. Therefore, the probability is 150/216, which simplifies to 25/36.

> Let me double-check the simplification. 150 ÷ 6 = 25 and 216 ÷ 6 = 36, so 150/216 = 25/36, which corresponds to option C. I should confirm that no edge cases violate the assumption that the forbidden residue is always available to exclude; since the cumulative sums after two and three rolls can indeed be 7, 14, etc., and the die never shows 0, the exclusions are always feasible and the 5/6 factors remain valid.

> Final answer: C) 25/36.

---

The probability that neither the first roll, nor the sum of the first two rolls, nor the sum of all three rolls is divisible by 7 is **25/36**. This is found by counting the 150 favorable outcomes out of 216 total, where each roll is restricted to avoid making the cumulative sum divisible by 7 at each step. The answer is **C. 25/36**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Total possible outcomes

Each die has 6 faces, so for three rolls the total number of outcomes is:

6 × 6 × 6 = 216

---

### Favorable outcomes

We need the number of outcomes where:

- The first roll is not divisible by 7.
- The sum of the first two rolls is not divisible by 7.
- The sum of all three rolls is not divisible by 7.

Since the die shows 1–6, the first roll is never divisible by 7, so we only need to ensure the two- and three-roll sums are not divisible by 7.

---

### Counting favorable outcomes

We count by considering the residue of the running sum modulo 7 at each step, ensuring we never hit 0 mod 7 after roll 2 or roll 3.

- **First roll**: 6 choices (1–6), none divisible by 7.
- **Second roll**: for each first roll, there are 5 choices that keep the two-roll sum not divisible by 7 (only the residue that would make the sum 0 mod 7 is excluded).
- **Third roll**: for each valid pair, there are again 5 choices that keep the three-roll sum not divisible by 7.

Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is:

6 × 5 × 5 = 150

---

### Probability calculation

The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

[150/216] = [25/36]

---

## Verification

We can verify by noting that at each step the restriction removes exactly 1/6 of the remaining paths, so the survival probability is (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36, which matches our count.

---

## Final answer

The probability is **25/36**, which corresponds to option **C**.

### Time to reality check the promises of machine learning-powered precision medicine [^1128iYxn]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2020). High credibility.

However, that machine learning cannot yet — if ever — conduct causal inference is arguably less of a barrier to achieving individual-level predictions than the second more fundamental problem that the majority of health states and events are so complex that we can only understand them probabilistically, and chance can never be predicted at the individual level. Indeed, although statistics — and hence machine learning — is excellent at helping us to understand and compare probabilities between groups, it is fundamentally unable to tell us what will happen to an individual. The power of statistics is precisely that it can describe and predict partly random events over large numbers of people. But no matter how accurately statistics can do this, it can never tell us with certainty what the next event will be.

For example, consider rolling two (fair) dice and counting the total score. Although we know what is most likely (seven), and we know with 100% certainty the probability of all other scores (eg, 1 in 32 for a double six), we are still no closer to knowing what the next roll will actually be. Likewise, even the most sophisticated causal inference methods cannot determine with certainty the effect of an individual variable in an individual person (eg, the effect of systolic blood pressure on the risk of stroke). This issue is not resolvable by simply collecting more data or building increasingly complex models, because it stems from limitations of our understanding of physical and biological processes. Since most health processes are effectively probabilistic, we must accept that individual outcomes will always be subject to chance, no matter how precisely we can describe these for groups of similar patients.

### Fair by chance? On the use of algorithms in therapeutic decisions [^115k5LkS]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictive tools made possible by advances in machine learning techniques may help clinicians make more accurate decisions about who should be allocated costly therapies, such as immunotherapy, which only work on a relatively low proportion of patients. In this article, I argue that a fair decision procedure must recognise each patients' chance of responding well. To do so, the procedure should not apply a fixed threshold to probability scores. Rather, each patient should be given a chance of being allocated the therapy matching her probability score. An important consequence of this conclusion is that the fair use of algorithmic scores may not guarantee that the therapy is allocated to those who will respond well to the highest possible degree.

Underlying algorithms

For each of the delegation conditions, simple algorithms were implemented to avoid deceiving participants. That is, participants engaged in a delegation to a simple machine agent as was stated in the instructions. For the rule-based condition, the algorithm followed simple if–then rules as specified by the user.

For the supervised learning condition, the algorithm was implemented by first calculating the difference between the actual and reported rolls for each participant in training data sourced from a pre-pilot in which participants performed an incentivized die-roll task themselves (n = 96). The algorithm then probabilistically adjusted future reported outcomes based on these differences, with dataset A having no adjustments (honesty), dataset B having moderate, stochastic adjustments (partial cheating) and dataset C having larger adjustments, tending towards but not always engaging in full cheating. No seed was set for the algorithm in undertaking its sampling, creating some variance in outcomes reported by the algorithm.

For the goal-based condition, the algorithmic output was guided by the setting on a seven-notch dial ranging from 'maximize accuracy' to 'maximize profit'. The algorithm adjusted the results of a series of actual die rolls to achieve a desired total sum, manipulating a specific list of integers (that is, 6, 6, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3) representing the sequence of actual die-roll outcomes. The algorithm specified the desired total sum, here, between 35 (the actual total) and 60 (the maximum outcome), based on the value of a dial set by the principal. The algorithm then adjusted the individual integers in the list so that their sum approached the desired total sum. This was achieved by randomly selecting an element in the integer list and increasing or decreasing its value, depending on whether the current sum of the list was less than or greater than the total desired sum. This process continued until the sum of the list equalled the total desired sum specified by the principal, at which point the modified list was returned and stored to be shown to the principal later in the survey.

### Commitment to honesty oaths decreases dishonesty, but commitment to another individual does not affect dishonesty [^1129jzxZ]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several advantages to this task. First, the mind game is completely private, and actual selections cannot be recorded (which has been found to increase dishonesty). The original mind gameonly includes a binary outcome (participants either win or not), which reduces the overall power of the measure and also makes dishonesty an all or nothing decision (you can either cheat or not). We therefore combined the mind game with a payoff scheme similar to the die roll task. Importantly, the mind-shape paradigm does not need external applications to mimic a die roll and relies on basic geometric shapes that are recognized across cultures – (see Supplementary Fig. 1).

To test the validity of the mind-shape task and to use a more commonly used and validatedprocedure to assess dishonesty, participants in Studies 2–3 and 6–7 completed a die roll task based on previous studies. In each trial, participants were asked to privately roll a die by either using an actual die or using an external website. We emphasized that responses from the external website could not be linked to our survey, so die rolls were occurring in private. Participants were then asked to report number of pips they rolled with each being associated with a different payoff (Study 2: 1 = 0pts, 2 = 60pts, 3 = 120pts, 4 = 180pts, 5 = 240pts, 6 = 300pts; Study 3: 1 = 0p, 2 = 4p, 3 = 8p, 4 = 12p, 5 = 16p, 6 = 20p; Study 4–6: 1 = £0, 2 = £0.4, 3 = £0.8, 4 = £1.2, 5 = £1.6, 6 = £2; Study 7: 1 = £0.3, 2 = £0.6, 3 = £0.9, 4 = £1.2, 5 = £1.5, 6 = £1.8), leaving the possibility for participants to increase their payoff by misreporting the die roll.

Ratings for both economic games were always on a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 representing the lowest and 6 the highest possible bonus payout.

Conditions and outcomes

Participants in study 1 (n = 597) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. In the control condition, they reported the results of the ten die rolls themselves. In the remaining conditions, they delegated these ten reports to machine agents (Methods, study 1). The conditions differed in the interface that participants used to transmit their instructions to the machine (Fig. 1). In the rule-based condition, participants had to explicitly tell the machine what number to report for each of the six possible die-roll outcomes. In the supervised learning condition, participants chose one of three example datasets to train the machine. In one example dataset, the reports were always the same as the die rolls. In another, the reports were always six, regardless of the die rolls. In another, the reports were either the same as or above the actual die roll, indicating occasional cheating. The three example datasets featured a series of ten die-roll outcomes but just five reports. This incomplete reporting was intended to evoke a sense of uncertainty that comes with delegation, and to mimic how programmers rarely inspect the entire dataset, but only peruse a subset of it. A comprehension check with an independent sample of participants showed that modal expectations about machine behaviour trained on each dataset were accurate (see Supplementary Information (supplemental study A) and Supplementary Fig. 4). In the goal-based condition, participants gave the machine a high-level goal by choosing a setting on a dial that ranged from 'maximize accuracy' to 'maximize profit', with five intermediate notches. These results were robust to changing these two labels to 'not prioritize profit at all' and 'fully prioritize profit' (see Supplementary Information (supplemental study B) and Supplementary Fig. 5).

Conditions

Study 1 entailed four between-subjects conditions. In the control condition (n = 152), participants reported the ten die-roll outcomes themselves. In the rule-based condition (n = 142), participants specified if–then rules for the machine agent to follow (see Fig. 1, first row). Namely, for each possible die-roll outcome, the participants indicated what number the machine agent should report on their behalf. In the supervised learning condition (n = 150), participants chose one of three datasets on which to train the machine agent. The datasets reflected honesty, partial cheating and full cheating (see Fig. 1, second row). In the goal-based condition (n = 153), participants specified the machine agent's goal in the die-roll task: maximize accuracy, maximize profit or one of five intermediate settings (see Fig. 1, third row).

Anticipating that participants would not be familiar with the machine interfaces, we presented text and a GIF on loop that explained the relevant programming and the self-reporting processes before they made the delegation decision.

### Cumulative prognostic score predicting mortality in patients older than 80 years admitted to the ICU [^113pqJQ4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

More than 10% of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are 80 years and older. 1 This proportion of "very old intensive care patients" (VIPs) is estimated to increase up to 36% in 2025. 2, 3 However, once VIPs have been admitted to the ICU for an acute medical reason, their overall 30‐day mortality is high. The frailer patients in particular have a high mortality. 4 Despite careful patient selection before ICU admission, more than half of these VIPs will die or will experience major functional deterioration in the 6 months following their admission. 5, 6

As a result of our current uncertainty in predicting which VIPs could potentially benefit from ICU treatment, we often offer them an "ICU trial". This means admitting VIPs to an ICU, offering them life‐sustaining treatment for a period of 2 to 3 days, and then reevaluating if they show any improvement. If patients deteriorate, limitations in life‐sustaining therapies would be required. 7 For ICU physicians, this ICU trial postpones the difficult ICU admission triage decision by a few days, and by then, some patients have improved. However, some will still receive life‐sustaining therapy, and a decision to continue treatment should be discussed with the patient or his or her legal representatives. 8 Inevitably, during such shared decision‐making processes, the question of chances of survival emerges. Most intensivists estimate a patient's chances of outcome on experience and on preferences. Current severity scoring systems are not tailored for VIPs, 1 and proposed models for VIP are not precise enough. 9, 10

We hypothesize that a cumulative prognostic score can predict 30‐day mortality and thus support physicians and relatives with the decision to continue care or start a new treatment.

### Does monetary reward operantly enhance pain sensitivity over time? An experiment in healthy individuals [^112VnoUY]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Rolling dice procedure

Figure 1 shows the protocol of this experiment. The rolling dice and payoff procedure were explained to the participants at the beginning of each session. To determine their individual payoff (= reward), the participants were instructed to roll the six-sided dice into a masked stand, which was not monitored by anyone. Prior to the experiments, all participants were informed that the payoff was decided by reporting the number of dice in 50 yen for numbers between 1 and 5, namely 50 yen for 1, 100 yen for 2, 150 yen for 3, 200 yen for 4, 250 yen for 5, and 0 yen for 6. The instructions also explicitly stated that the numbers of dice actually appeared would not be known to the experimenter. Thus, the subjects could easily be dishonest. Lying indicated reporting a different number than the number actually appeared. The participants reported the numbers for each roll of dice to the experimenter (YS) immediately after rolling procedure. It was impossible to detect lying at the individual level. The deceptive report was assumed only that the individual would receive a typically higher payoff than expected value by chance.

All participants were instructed to roll the dices three times at baseline and week 12. In contrast, from week 1 to week 3, the subjects were only informed that "the subjects who perceived pain stronger than the mean score during the previous session can roll the dices six times and those who perceived pain less than that can roll the dices three times". The determination of "the mean score during the previous session" was kept a secret from the participants. Moreover, the secret determination of the number of times the dice was rolled represented the mean score ratings for the 100 g VFM stimulus at the previous session.

In this experiment, we calculated the theoretical value of payoff for each roll of dice because the numbers of rolling dice were different (three or six) by the participant from week 1 to week 3. The payoff for each roll of dice was calculated as amount of payoff divided by the number of rolling dice for each participant at each session.

Study 3a

Sample. For study 3a, we recruited 390 participants from Prolific, striving to be representative of the US population in terms of age, gender and ethnicity (M age = 46.0; s.d. age = 15.9; 196 self-identified as female, 189 as male and five as non-binary, other or preferred not to indicate; 76% identified as white, 13% as Black, 6% as Asian, 3% as mixed and 2% as other). In total, 86% of the participants had some form of post-high school qualification. The study was conducted on Qualtrics.

Procedure, measures and conditions. Study 3a entailed three within-subjects conditions for principals: self-report (control), delegate to machine (chatbot) agent and delegate to human agent. Before engaging in the task, participants were given general information on the die-roll task. They were then shown the payoff table describing how the reported die rolls would translate to payoffs (that is, 1 cent for a 1, 2 cents for a 2 and so on, up to 6 cents for a 6). Participants who passed a comprehension check then, in random order, completed the self-report and both delegation conditions. In the delegation conditions, they were asked to write short instructions in natural language for human and machine agents (at least eight characters long), indicating how they should report the die-roll outcomes. Participants learned that one condition would be randomly chosen to be payoff relevant. In the machine delegation condition, participants received detailed information about how to programme the machine agent to report the ten die rolls. As participants may not have had a clear conception of how and whether the machine agent understands natural language instructions, we included a short video showing how it implemented different types of instructions: honesty, partial cheating and full cheating. Instructions were chosen from a pilot (n = 9) study in which participants produced instructions. The instructions that we drew upon included some with nuance in conveying unethical intentions by means of indirect speech. To balance the video presentation across conditions and avoid a condition-specific priming effect, we also showed short videos in the self-report and human agent conditions. These videos displayed, in random order, three examples of die-roll reporting that reflected honesty, partial cheating and full cheating for the same die-roll outcome. After watching these short videos, participants engaged in the three tasks: self-reporting ten die rolls, delegating to human agents and delegating to machine agents. After completing all three tasks, participants were asked to indicate the behaviour they intended from the human and machine agents. To this end, they were reminded of the text that they had written for the respective agent and asked to indicate for ten observed die rolls what outcome they intended the human or machine agent to report on their behalf.

### Fair algorithms for selecting citizens' assemblies [^116fo469]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

To our knowledge, all of the selection algorithms previously used in practice (Supplementary Information section 12) aim to satisfy one particular property, known as 'descriptive representation' (that the panel should reflect the composition of the population). Unfortunately, the pool from which the panel is chosen tends to be far from representative. Specifically, the pool tends to overrepresent groups with members who are on average more likely to accept an invitation to participate, such as the group 'college graduates'. To ensure descriptive representation despite the biases of the pool, selection algorithms require that the panels they output satisfy upper and lower 'quotas' on a set of specified features, which are roughly proportional to the population rate of each feature (for example, quotas might require that a 40-person panel contain between 19 and 21 women). These quotas are generally imposed on feature categories delineated by gender, age, education level and other attributes that are relevant to the policy issue at hand. In Supplementary Information section 3, we demonstrate that quota constraints of this form are more general than those that are achievable via 'stratified sampling', which is a technique that is often used for drawing representative samples.

Selection algorithms that pre-date this work focused only on satisfying quotas, leaving unaddressed a second property that is also central to sortition: that all individuals should have an equal chance of being chosen for the panel. Several political theorists present equality of selection probabilities as a central advantage of sortition, and stress its role in promoting ideals such as equality of opportunity, democratic equality,– and allocative justice. Engelstad, who introduced an influential model of the benefits of sortition, argues that this form of equality constitutes '[t]he strongest normative argument in favour of sortition'(for more details on desiderata from political theory, see Supplementary Information section 4). In addition to political theorists, major practitioner groups have also advocated for equal selection probabilities. However, these practitioners face the fundamental hurdle that, in practice, the quotas almost always necessitate selecting people with somewhat unequal probabilities, as individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the pool must be chosen with disproportionately high probabilities to satisfy the quotas. Two previous papers, have suggested mathematical models in which selection algorithms can reconcile equal selection probabilities with representativeness, but both of these studies make assumptions that are incompatible with current practice (Supplementary Information section 5).

### Recovery potential in patients after cardiac arrest who die after limitations or withdrawal of life support [^1141n612]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Understanding the relationship between patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes is fundamental to medicine. When critically ill patients die after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST), the inability to observe the potential for recovery with continued aggressive care could bias future clinical decisions and research.

Objective

To quantify the frequency with which experts consider patients who died after WLST following resuscitated cardiac arrest to have had recovery potential if life-sustaining therapy had been continued.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study included comatose adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) treated following resuscitation from cardiac arrest at a single academic medical center between January 1, 2010, and July 31, 2022. Patients with advanced directives limiting critical care or who experienced cardiac arrest of traumatic or neurologic etiology were excluded. An international cohort of experts in post-arrest care based on clinical experience and academic productivity was identified. Experts reviewed the cases between August 24, 2022, and February 11, 2024.

Exposure

Patients who died after WLST.

Main Outcome and Measures

Three or more experts independently estimated recovery potential for each patient had life-sustaining treatment been continued, using a 7-point numerical ordinal scale. In the primary analysis, which involved the patient cases with death after WLST, a 1% or greater estimated recovery potential was considered to be clinically meaningful. In secondary analyses, thresholds of 5% and 10% estimated recovery probability were explored.

Results

A total of 2391 patients (median [IQR] age, 59 [48–69] years; 1455 men [60.9%]) were included, of whom 714 (29.9%) survived to discharge. Cases of uncertain outcome (1431 patients [59.8%]) in which WLST preceded death were reviewed by 38 experts who rendered 4381 estimates of recovery potential. In 518 cases (36.2%; 95% CI, 33.7%-38.7%), all experts believed that recovery potential was less than 1% if life-sustaining therapies had been continued. In the remaining 913 cases (63.8%; 95% CI, 61.3%-66.3%), at least 1 expert believed that recovery potential was at least 1%. In 227 cases (15.9%; 95% CI, 14.0%-17.9%), all experts agreed that recovery potential was at least 1%, and in 686 cases (47.9%; 95% CI, 45.3%-50.6%), expert estimates differed at this threshold.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, most who died after WLST were considered by experts to have had recovery potential. These findings suggest that novel solutions to avoiding deaths based on biased prognostication or incomplete information are needed.

### A note on competing risks in survival data analysis [^113KK7Ak]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Equivalently, we can consider estimating the incidence of mortality among patients with breast cancer. In the above example, the estimated incidence of mortality at 1 year is five out of 100 patients, that is, 5%. The probability of dying at 2 years is the probability of living past the first year and dying during the second year. Note that 95 of 100 patients survived past the first year, and 10 of these 95 patients died in the second year. Therefore, the estimated incidence of mortality at 2 years is 95/100 * 10/95 = 10%. The cumulative incidence of mortality up to a given time is the probability that an individual dies by that time. This is the sum of mortality incidences occurring up to that time. Therefore, the cumulative incidence of mortality at 2 years is the sum of mortality incidences in the first and second years, that is, 5+10 = 15%. This is simply the converse of survival. In other words, the cumulative incidence of an event at a given time is one minus the overall survival probability at that time.

### Development of prognosis in palliative care study (PiPS) predictor models to improve prognostication in advanced cancer: prospective cohort study [^114CCVwa]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Relation to other studies

The PiPS models offer some definite advantages over existing methods of predicting survival in this population of patients. The most common method of prognostication is a clinician's prediction of survival. However, as this is a subjective assessment, predictions cannot be standardised across sites or over time. This lack of consistency means that relying on clinicians' predictions of survival is not an entirely suitable method of identifying patients for inclusion in clinical trials, for referral to specialist services, or for discussions with patients and families about the future. The PiPS-A scoring algorithms, although no more accurate than a multi-professional prognostic estimate, do provide an objective and repeatable output and would at the very least provide an excellent reproducible method for assessing eligibility for research studies. When blood results are available, the PiPS-B scores are significantly more accurate than either a doctor's or a nurse's estimate and thus could provide a robust rationale for making many decisions about treatment.

Other than clinicians' estimates, the most widely studied method of predicting survival in patients with advanced cancer is probably the palliative prognostic score. This score is calculated from six variables, one of which is itself a clinician's prediction. Each variable is allotted a "partial score" that depends on the size of the regression coefficient. Total palliative prognostic scores can range between 0 and 17.5 and define three prognostic categories representing different probabilities of surviving 30 days (< 30%, 30–70%, and > 70%). The palliative prognostic score has been subsequently validated in several clinical studies. One of its drawbacks is the heavy weighting that is attributed to the clinician's prediction of survival; the partial score for the clinician's prediction can represent 8.8/17.5 (49%) of the total score. Moreover, clinicians are required to provide an unrealistically accurate prognostic estimate in two week intervals. A patient who is expected to live for three to four weeks thus scores 1.5 points more than a patient expected to survive for five to six weeks and 3.5 points more than a patient expected for live for seven to 10 weeks. Most clinicians are reluctant to offer prognostic estimates with this degree of precision. Another limitation of the palliative prognostic score is the difficulty of converting the prognostic categories into meaningful clinical information. How should a clinician (or patient) interpret the information that they have a 30–70% chance of surviving 30 days? PiPS overcomes these problems.

### Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of clinical risk models [^111pg2Y5]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is a useful method to measure the ability of a clinical risk model to discriminate between hospital deaths and survivors. Its use in medicine originated as a method for synthesizing the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests across a spectrum of possible cut points. The area under the ROC curve can be interpreted as a probability of correct classification or prediction. We illustrate its use in three steps: first, with a dichotomous variable to introduce specificity and sensitivity; next, with a categorical risk factor (surgical urgency) to produce a primitive ROC curve; and finally, with a continuous risk factor (age) to approximate the usual ROC curve used for clinical risk models.

### Using clinical risk models to predict outcomes: what are we predicting and why? [^1174Pji7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical risk prediction models can support decision making in emergency medicine, but directing intervention towards high-risk patients may involve a flawed assumption. This concepts paper examines prognostic clinical risk prediction and specifically describes the potential impact of treatment effects in model development studies. Treatment effects may lead to models failing to achieve the aim of identifying the patients most likely to benefit from intervention, and may instead identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from intervention.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk scores: who, when and why? [^114isajK]. World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rockall score for upper GI bleeding" for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal hemorrhage.

The Initial Rockall Score is a clinical calculator used for predicting mortality due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This scoring system is applicable to patients who present with upper GI bleeding, regardless of the underlying cause. The score is calculated based on three parameters: age, shock, and presence of comorbidity. The higher the score, the higher the risk of mortality.

The clinical utility of the Initial Rockall Score is to aid in risk stratification of patients with upper GI bleeding, helping clinicians to identify high-risk patients who may require more aggressive management or intervention. It can also assist in decision-making regarding hospital admission and discharge.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Initial Rockall Score. However, it should be noted that this score does not take into account the severity or source of the bleeding, and therefore should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tools.

The Initial Rockall score is designed to estimate the risk of mortality due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding by evaluating three factors: age, the presence and degree of shock, and any major comorbidities. Each factor is assigned a score, and these scores are then summed to provide an overall risk score.

For age, the scoring is:

- **Less than 60 years**: 0 points
- **Between 60 and 79 years**: 1 point
- **80 years or older**: 2 points

Shock is assessed based on blood pressure and heart rate:

- No shock, with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 100 mmHg and heart rate (HR) less than 100 bpm: 0 points
- **SBP of at least 100 mmHg with HR of at least 100 bpm**: 1 point
- **SBP less than 100 mmHg**: 2 points

Comorbidities are scored as follows:

- **No major comorbidity**: 0 points
- **Any major comorbidity, such as cardiac failure or ischemic heart disease**: 2 points
- **Renal failure, liver failure, or disseminated malignancy**: 3 points

The total Rockall score is the sum of these individual scores, ranging from 0 to 7 points. This score is then translated into an interpretation of mortality risk:

- A score of 0 indicates a risk of mortality of 0.2%.
- A score of 1 corresponds to a risk of 2.4%.
- A score of 2 corresponds to a risk of 5.6%.
- A score of 3 corresponds to a risk of 11%.
- A score of 4 corresponds to a risk of 24.6%.
- A score of 5 corresponds to a risk of 39.6%.
- A score of 6 corresponds to a risk of 48.9%.
- A score of 7 corresponds to a risk of 50%.

By examining these factors systematically and assigning the appropriate numerical scores, healthcare providers can gain a clearer understanding of the patient's mortality risk due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, facilitating more informed clinical decisions.

### Model of a queuing approach for patient accrual in phase 1 oncology studies [^116628Rx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

For all scenarios, the IQ 3 + 3 design had shorter expected study durations than the 3 + 3 design, ranging from a reduction of 1.6 to 10.4 months (Figure 2 A), and likewise, the IQ rolling 6 design has lower expected study durations than the rolling 6 design, ranging from a reduction of 0.4 months to 10.5 months (Figure 2 B). There was a small increase in the mean number of patients treated on the IQ 3 + 3 design (difference in mean number of patients in all scenarios, < 3.2 patients; Figure 2 C), while the IQ rolling 6 had a smaller mean number of patients than the rolling 6 in 9 of the 12 scenarios, with a difference that did not exceed 3.3 patients (Figure 2 D). Detailed results can be found in eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement.

### Impact of a prospective feedback loop on care review activities in older patients at the end of life. A stepped-wedge randomised trial [^115UY6LV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The trial screened 7293 patients, with 4305 (59%) deemed at-risk. Descriptive characteristics of the patients for the usual care and intervention phases indicate an elderly and vulnerable group with a majority at-risk of death (see Table 1). The summary statistics are similar and indicate no clear differences between the usual care and intervention phases.

Table 1
Basic characteristics of the patients by intervention phase. Results combined across the three hospitals. Row three shows the percent at-risk, and the following rows are for at-risk patients only

The cumulative probability curves are in Fig. 2 with a version including confidence intervals shown in Additional file 3: Fig. S1. The number of outcomes is in Additional file 3: Table S1.

Cumulative probability curves for the three outcomes (solid lines) and the competing risk of discharge/death (dotted lines) by blinded hospital names. The x-axis is the time since the patient came under the care of the clinical team and ends at 15 days, which focuses on most events and illustrates the rapid changes in the first few days of the patients' admission to the enrolled clinical teams. The y-axis is the cumulative probability of the outcome or death/discharge. The upper limits on the y-axes vary by outcome

In Hospitals X and Y, patients in the usual care phase were more likely to have experienced a clinical-led review discussion and review of care directive measures than patients in the intervention phase, whereas the curves for Hospital Z show a slight improvement on both outcomes during the intervention phase. The differences between the usual care and intervention phases for palliative care referrals were small in all three hospitals. Discharges were generally faster in the intervention than usual care phase in Hospitals X and Y, which reduced opportunity for audit and may explain why fewer outcomes were observed in the intervention phase. The survival data are illustrated in Additional file 3: Fig. S2.

The results from the probability curves during the intervention phase are reinforced by the absolute differences in probabilities at 21 days from admission, shown in Table 2.

### Outcome class imbalance and rare events: an underappreciated complication for overdose risk prediction modeling [^115Ds9Km]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Low outcome prevalence, often observed with opioid-related outcomes, poses an underappreciated challenge to accurate predictive modeling. Outcome class imbalance, where non-events (i.e. negative class observations) outnumber events (i.e. positive class observations) by a moderate to extreme degree, can distort measures of predictive accuracy in misleading ways, and make the overall predictive accuracy and the discriminatory ability of a predictive model appear spuriously high. We conducted a simulation study to measure the impact of outcome class imbalance on predictive performance of a simple SuperLearner ensemble model and suggest strategies for reducing that impact.

Design, Setting, Participants

Using a Monte Carlo design with 250 repetitions, we trained and evaluated these models on four simulated data sets with 100000 observations each: one with perfect balance between events and non-events, and three where non-events outnumbered events by an approximate factor of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1, respectively.

Measurements

We evaluated the performance of these models using a comprehensive suite of measures, including measures that are more appropriate for imbalanced data.

Findings

Increasing imbalance tended to spuriously improve overall accuracy (using a high threshold to classify events vs non-events, overall accuracy improved from 0.45 with perfect balance to 0.99 with the most severe outcome class imbalance), but diminished predictive performance was evident using other metrics (corresponding positive predictive value decreased from 0.99 to 0.14).

Conclusion

Increasing reliance on algorithmic risk scores in consequential decision-making processes raises critical fairness and ethical concerns. This paper provides broad guidance for analytic strategies that clinical investigators can use to remedy the impacts of outcome class imbalance on risk prediction tools.

D, Number of patients who started treatment for the rolling 6 and IQ rolling 6 designs. Graphs are based on 800 simulations per scenario (Table 3).

For scenario A1, the typical phase 1 study in the consortium, the expected (mean) duration of the phase 1 study using the traditional 3 + 3 design was 19.5 months (range, 7.1–41.3 months), whereas the expected duration was 15.8 months (range, 5.3–27.0 months) for the IQ 3 + 3 design. This represents an expected reduction of 3.7 months (difference in medians, 3.6 months; a 19% reduction). There is a mean increase of 2.8 patients. In eTable 5 in the Supplement, we extended this mean scenario to 9 dose levels, so the MTD would almost assuredly be reached before the highest allowable dose level. In that setting, the expected duration was reduced by 5.4 months (26.0 vs 20.6 months; a 21% reduction), and we also present additional metrics (expected percentage of patients on each dose level) that confirm that the operating characteristics of the 3 + 3 design are maintained.

### Identifying unreliable predictions in clinical risk models [^115ie8Tt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A method for estimating unreliable predictions

Given a clinical risk stratification model that estimates the probability of an adverse outcome for a patient with a set of prognostic features, our strategy for identifying unreliable predictions is to construct a separate risk metric using summary statistics from the same training data that were used to develop the risk model under consideration. When the two estimates disagree on a specific patient, we say that the training data are unable to provide a reliable prediction for this patient. To make this explicit, let:
denote a random variable corresponding to a set of prognostic characteristics (the feature vector);
0,1 denote a random variable designating the true patient outcome (also known as the class label); i.e. we consider a binary classification problem. For example, y = 1 if a patient dies within some specified time after initial diagnosis (the positive class) and y = 0 otherwise (the negative class);
denote the clinical risk model that takes a feature vector as input and outputs a risk score that can be used to estimate the probability of the true class label. As clinical risk models generally report the probability of an adverse event, or some score that can be translated into a probability, via a nomogram, we consider the case where.

The separate, alternate, risk metric, is calculated using the same data that were used to calculate. As we are interested in developing a method that does not require training a new model using the training data, our goal is to derive an expression forthat is straightforward to compute based only on summary statistics of the training data. In our formalism, is calculated using appropriately trained generative models where one model generates feature vectors consistent with patients in the positive class, and the other generates feature vectors consistent with patients in the negative class,(hence the superscript G). With these conventions, the corresponding unreliability metric can be represented as:

where. It follows that, where the higher the value ofthe more unreliable the model prediction. In practice, we work with an alternate form of, which is similar to that presented in equation, but that is easier to calculate:whereis the probability that a patient actually belongs to the y = 1 class, given that the clinical risk model, assigns a score ofto a patient with prognostic features,(see Supplementary Methods). It is straightforward to show thatimplies(see Supplementary Methods).

### Introduction to clinical decision making [^114gtvZZ]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In the last few years there has been a remarkable increase in the amount of clinical data in the average hospital chart, and more and more problem-solving algorithms have been developed. We need better "thinking tools" to help us handle the flow of information. The term "clinical decision making" is used to describe a systematic way to handle data and algorithms to decide on a best course of action. This introductory article discusses some of the problems in establishing a decision criterion, both for a population and for an individual patient. Comparing the probabilities and utilities of various diagnostic outcomes (true positive, false positive, etc.) leads to a diagnostic strategy. The article also discusses conditional probability. Bayes' theorem, and likelihood ratios.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^112NXLKX]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

EGRIS — In adults with acute Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), the EGRIS uses three clinical variables at hospital admission, with a sum score ranging from 0 to 7 corresponding to a predicted risk of respiratory failure from 1 to 90%, and it has been validated including the International GBS Outcome Study of 1023 patients; when counseling family members or surrogates, we suggest that the EGRIS be considered a moderately reliable prognostic model for the probability of needing mechanical ventilation within 14 days of disease onset (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), noting reported AUC values of 80% in IGOS validation subgroups, an AUC of 0.63 in a Peruvian cohort, and that only prediction within 1 week from hospital admission is available though only 3% of the development cohort were intubated after the first week.

### A deeper understanding of system interactions can explain contradictory field results on pesticide impact on honey bees [^115pjRpw]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In a second experiment, virus-free honey bees were artificially fed virus particles or not and the tests were repeated, confirming the results reported above (Fig. 3b; Table 1). In particular, we found that control bees had a median longevity of 18 days and an interquartile range of 5, whereas virus-treated bees had a shorter median longevity (i.e. 10) as a result of a large number of bees dying in the first days, as underlined by a much larger dispersion of longevity data (interquartile range = 12). This further supports the view that the presence of an immune-suppressing virus can create vastly different outcomes depending on the slightly different initial conditions of single bees exposed to otherwise identical situations.

In summary, by carrying out two different comparisons of uninfected versus virus-infected bees (one diachronic, with naturally virus-infected bees sampled at two different times, and one synchronic, by treating or not with the virus some uninfected bees at the same time), we noted that uninfected bees show mortality concentrated after three weeks of life, as expected given the shape of the survival curve of control caged bees previously observed under the same conditions. In contrast, the mortality of virus-infected bees is not concentrated late in life but can also occur at a young age, resulting in a marked variability of longevities. Thus, as predicted by our model analysis, the probability of dying either soon or late does not only depend on the treatment but rather on the slightly different intrinsic conditions of bees. These were not under our control but dictated the bee's final destiny.

### A note on competing risks in survival data analysis [^116jYxoB]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

GENERAL CONCEPTS IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS

Clinical studies often focus on estimating the survivor function or the overall survival probability. This is the probability of being event-free at least up to a given time. The event is any specific event of interest. The overall survival probability is estimated using the person follow-up time and event status. The survival at a given time is the conditional probability of surviving to a specific time given that the individual is at risk for the event (such as mortality) at that time. This is estimated as the ratio of the number of individuals that are event-free at that time to the number of individuals that lived event-free at least up to that time. Henceforth, when referring to survival at a given time, we in fact mean survival conditional upon being at risk at that time.

For example, let us consider the event of interest to be death. Suppose 100 breast cancer patients lived for at least 1 year following surgery and five patients died at the end of the first year. The estimated survival at 1 year is 95%. This estimate is the survival probability conditional upon the fact that the 95 surviving patients were all at risk at 1 year. Suppose at 2 years, 10 more patients die. The estimated survival at 2 years is 85/95 = 89.5%. The estimated overall survival up to and including 2 years is the probability of having survived the first year and the second year. This is calculated as 95 * 89.5 = 85%. Therefore, the overall survival or the probability of surviving up to 2 years is 85%. This is the basis for the Kaplan–Meier estimate of survival probability.

### Evaluating multivariate risk scores for clinical decision making [^111SWU61]. Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The medical literature abounds with risk scores that can help clinicians predict the probability of disease. Risk scores are popular and attractive because they synthesize the effects of several different risk factors for disease in a way that is otherwise too complex for the human mind alone to analyze. However, to optimize clinical decision making, users of risk scores need to consider the factors and methods used to create the score and to recognize the potential limitations of risk scores. Clinicians should consider the patient populations in which the risk score has been developed and validated, the risk factors included in the score, how computing the score might fit into the flow of daily practice, and how risk scores can help estimate pretest probability. An awareness of the uses and potential limitations of using risk assessment tools will aid the clinician in daily clinical decision making. These tools may grow in importance and use with increasing utilization of electronic health records.

### Predicting what will happen when we act. what counts for warrant? [^113GT5mJ]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To what extent do the results of randomized controlled trials inform our predictions about the effectiveness of potential policy interventions? This crucial question is often overlooked in discussions about evidence-based policy. The view I defend is that the arguments that lead from the claim that a program works somewhere to a prediction about the effectiveness of this program as it will be implemented here rests on many premises, most of which cannot be justified by the results of randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials only provide indirect evidence for effectiveness, and we need much more than just randomized- controlled-trial results to make reliable predictions.

### The use and drawbacks of risk-grouping in prediction models [^115svsL2]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk-grouping leads to loss of information

Categorizing predictions into risk groups implies that the risks (or probabilities) are identical for all individuals within each group, resulting in the loss of granularity in risk estimates. For example, the 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence in the 'intermediate risk' group may range between 10 and 25%, depending on VENUSS scores of 3, 4, or 5. This crude grouping results in a loss of information crucial for individualized disease management.

Precise risk estimation can guide personalized treatment

A clear benefit to prediction models is that patient-specific risk predictions can be directly obtained to guide patient care. Informed treatment decision-making requires the understanding of a patient's 'threshold probability' – the critical point at which the expected benefit of the treatment equals the expected benefit of avoiding the treatment – and above which would prompt a patient to opt for adjuvant treatments. A cancer-averse patient may opt for adjuvant treatment at a predicted 5-year recurrence rate of 5%, whereas a treatment-averse patient may only do so when the risk of recurrence is above 35%. Using a decision curve, physicians can demonstrate the net benefit of receiving adjuvant treatment at various threshold probabilities.

The VENUSS study presented multiple decision curves, but their utility in providing patient-specific risks is limited because such risk-grouping de-emphasizes the variability in threshold probabilities. The three predefined risk groups produced exactly three discrete points instead of a continuous curve reflecting a range of potential threshold probabilities. Consider a scenario in which a patient contemplates whether to undergo adjuvant treatment, where an applicable threshold probability for that decision ranges between 10 and 20% for the outcome of recurrence at 5 years: all patients in the VENUSS intermediate risk group (group-based risk of 15.4% at 5 years) would have been recommended for adjuvant treatment. However, depending on where they fall within the risk group, patients may have made a different decision if they were provided with a specific recurrence probability at a landmark time instead of the VENUSS group. Thus, the precision of risk predictions enhances the shared decision-making process between patients and physicians to incorporate individual risk tolerance.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^112Z1CSi]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care — Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient's plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient's previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient's goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient's documented treatment decisions, the patient's preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child's wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent's individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers' expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### Model of a queuing approach for patient accrual in phase 1 oncology studies [^1158M1jM]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

For scenario C1, the expected study duration was reduced from 34.2 months to 24.5 months, a 9.7-month (28%) reduction. This was expected given the inevaluable rate of 66% (with a 30% screen failure rate) and the amount of time a patient will be pending (up to 84 days).

The expected number of patients required increased by 3.2, and the frequency of the MTD selected differed by less than 1%. The results of changing the arrival patterns or inevaluability rate are reflected in C2 and C3.

The last scenario, D, demonstrated a lengthier expected study duration of 42.1 months using the 3 + 3 design. This was 31.9 months with the IQ 3 + 3 design. The selection of the MTD differed by 0.5% to 1.5%.

For comparisons of the rolling 6 and IQ rolling 6 designs on the same 12 scenarios, a similar pattern emerged. For scenario A1, for example, the reduction in expected study duration for the IQ rolling 6 design is 3.4 months (16.4 vs 13.0 months), with a difference in the proportion of simulations choosing any particular dose as the MTD ranging from 0.1% to 1.1%; the difference in median study duration was 3.9 months. There were no extra patients treated, and in fact, the expected number of patients was reduced by 0.6 patients, reflecting that the rolling 6 design generally requires all patients treated to complete their assessment before escalating (even if 0 DLTs are noted in the first 3 patients), which adds time at that dose level and potentially results in even more patients at that dose level. For extended scenario A1 (eTable 5 in the Supplement), the expected reduction was 4.7 months.

### Drug treatment for spinal muscular atrophy type I [^113XnRLa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Children with SMA type I will never be able to sit without support and usually die by the age of two years. There are no known efficacious drug treatments that influence the course of the disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To evaluate whether drug treatment is able to slow or arrest the disease progression of SMA type I, and to assess if such therapy can be given safely. Drug treatment for SMA types II and III is the topic of a separate updated Cochrane review.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (8 March 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1991 to February 2011), EMBASE (January 1991 to February 2011) and ISI Web of Knowledge (January 1991 to 8 March 2011). We searched the Clinical Trials Registry of the U.S. National Institute of Health (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) (8 March 2011) to identify additional trials that had not yet been published.

Selection Criteria

We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA type I. Participants had to fulfil the clinical criteria and have a deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene (5q11.2–13.2) confirmed by genetic analysis. The primary outcome measure was time from birth until death or full time ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were development of rolling, sitting or standing within one year after the onset of treatment, and adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (RW and AV) independently reviewed and extracted data from all potentially relevant trials. For included studies, pooled relative risks and standardised mean differences were to be calculated to assess treatment efficacy.

Main Results

One small randomised controlled study comparing riluzole treatment to placebo for 10 SMA type 1 children was identified and included in the original review. No further trials were identified for the update in 2011. Regarding the primary outcome measure, three of seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48 and 64 months, whereas all three children in the placebo group died; but the difference was not statistically significant. Regarding the secondary outcome measures, none of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to roll, sit or stand, and no adverse effects were observed. For several reasons the overall quality of the study was low, mainly because the study was too small to detect an effect and because of baseline differences. Follow-up of the 10 included children was complete.

Authors' Conclusions

No drug treatment for SMA type I has been proven to have significant efficacy.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^112YT8k1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Figure 1
Designs for cluster randomised trials allowing crossover (in one direction) from a control to an intervention condition, either during or after the end of the trial, showing the statistical power of each design in a particular scenario (see box 1). Each row is a cluster and each column is a calendar month. Clusters are randomised to intervention sequences at the beginning of month 1. Design (A) runs for one month, Designs (B) to (D) run for 11 months, and Designs (E) to (G) run for 6 months. Designs (A), (D) and (G) are parallel group designs. Designs (B) and (E) are classic stepped wedge designs. Designs (C) and (F) randomise clusters to just two sequences, but have the same minimum, maximum and average waiting time for the intervention as the classic stepped wedge designs (B) and (E),

First, a sense-check: do we really need to extend the timescale of our trial? What if we recruited women over a single month, with half the maternity units allocated to the intervention condition and half to the control (20 women in each condition)? This design is shown schematically in figure 1A. The power is 24% — not great, as we usually aim for a target of at least 80%, so there is something to be said for collecting data over a longer interval. What about a stepped wedge design? These are often presented as being statistically efficient. Figure 1B illustrates the classic stepped wedge scheme with a 'step-length', or interval between successive roll-outs, of 1 month. The power of this design is 91% — much more, in fact, than we need.

A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Population-based analysis of survival in spinal muscular atrophy [^112vZfho]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate probabilities of survival and its surrogate, that is, mechanical ventilation, in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

Methods

We studied survival in a population-based cohort on clinical prevalence of genetically confirmed, treatment-naive patients with SMA, stratified for best acquired motor milestone (i.e., none: type 1a/b; head control in supine position or rolling: type 1c; sitting independently: type 2a; standing: type 2b; walking: type 3a/b; adult onset: type 4). We also assessed the need for mechanical ventilation as a surrogate endpoint for survival.

Results

We included 307 patients with a total follow-up of 7,141 person-years. Median survival was 9 days in SMA type 1a, 7.7 months in type 1b, and 17.0 years in type 1c. Patients with type 2a had endpoint-free survival probabilities of 74.2% and 61.5% at ages 40 and 60 years, respectively. Endpoint-free survival of SMA types 2b, 3, and 4 was relatively normal, at least within the first 60 years of life. Patients with SMA types 1c and 2a required mechanical ventilation more frequently and from younger ages compared to patients with milder SMA types. In our cohort, patients ventilated up to 12 h/d progressed not gradually, but abruptly, to ≥ 16 h/d.

Conclusions

Shortened endpoint-free survival is an important characteristic of SMA types 1 and 2a, but not types 2b, 3, and 4. For SMA types 1c and 2a, the age at which initiation of mechanical ventilation is necessary may be a more suitable endpoint than the arbitrarily set 16 h/d.

### Drug treatment for spinal muscular atrophy type I [^111B2F3W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by a homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5, or a heterozygous deletion in combination with a point mutation in the second SMN1 allele. This results in degeneration of anterior horn cells, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. By definition, children with SMA type I are never able to sit without support and usually die or become ventilator dependent before the age of two years. There have until very recently been no drug treatments to influence the course of SMA. We undertook this updated review to evaluate new evidence on emerging treatments for SMA type I. The review was first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any drug therapy designed to slow or arrest progression of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type I.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Science conference proceedings in October 2018. We also searched two trials registries to identify unpublished trials (October 2018).

Selection Criteria

We sought all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA type I. Included participants had to fulfil clinical criteria and have a genetically confirmed deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene (5q11.2–13.2). The primary outcome measure was age at death or full-time ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were acquisition of motor milestones, i.e. head control, rolling, sitting or standing, motor milestone response on disability scores within one year after the onset of treatment, and adverse events and serious adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period. Treatment strategies involving SMN1 gene replacement with viral vectors are out of the scope of this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified two RCTs: one trial of intrathecal nusinersen in comparison to a sham (control) procedure in 121 randomised infants with SMA type I, which was newly included at this update, and one small trial comparing riluzole treatment to placebo in 10 children with SMA type I. The RCT of intrathecally-injected nusinersen was stopped early for efficacy (based on a predefined Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-Section 2 (HINE-2) response). At the interim analyses after 183 days of treatment, 41% (21/51) of nusinersen-treated infants showed a predefined improvement on HINE-2, compared to 0% (0/27) of participants in the control group. This trial was largely at low risk of bias. Final analyses (ranging from 6 months to 13 months of treatment), showed that fewer participants died or required full-time ventilation (defined as more than 16 hours daily for 21 days or more) in the nusinersen-treated group than the control group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.89; N = 121; a 47% lower risk; moderate-certainty evidence). A proportion of infants in the nusinersen group and none of 37 infants in the control group achieved motor milestones: 37/73 nusinersen-treated infants (51%) achieved a motor milestone response on HINE-2 (risk ratio (RR) 38.51, 95% CI 2.43 to 610.14; N = 110; moderate-certainty evidence); 16/73 achieved head control (RR 16.95, 95% CI 1.04 to 274.84; moderate-certainty evidence); 6/73 achieved independent sitting (RR 6.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 115.38; moderate-certainty evidence); 7/73 achieved rolling over (RR 7.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 131.29); and 1/73 achieved standing (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 36.92; moderate-certainty evidence). Seventy-one per cent of nusinersen-treated infants versus 3% of infants in the control group were responders on the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) measure of motor disability (RR 26.36, 95% CI 3.79 to 183.18; N = 110; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in the majority of infants but were no more frequent in the nusinersen-treated group than the control group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05 and RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89, respectively; N = 121; moderate-certainty evidence). In the riluzole trial, three of seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48, and 64 months, whereas all three children in the placebo group died. None of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to sit, which was the only milestone reported. There were no adverse effects. The certainty of the evidence for all measured outcomes from this study was very low, because the study was too small to detect or rule out an effect, and had serious limitations, including baseline differences. This trial was stopped prematurely because the pharmaceutical company withdrew funding. Various trials and studies investigating treatment strategies other than nusinersen, such as SMN2 augmentation by small molecules, are ongoing.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the very limited evidence currently available regarding drug treatments for SMA type 1, intrathecal nusinersen probably prolongs ventilation-free and overall survival in infants with SMA type I. It is also probable that a greater proportion of infants treated with nusinersen than with a sham procedure achieve motor milestones and can be classed as responders to treatment on clinical assessments (HINE-2 and CHOP INTEND). The proportion of children experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events on nusinersen is no higher with nusinersen treatment than with a sham procedure, based on evidence of moderate certainty. It is uncertain whether riluzole has any effect in patients with SMA type I, based on the limited available evidence. Future trials could provide more high-certainty, longer-term evidence to confirm this result, or focus on comparing new treatments to nusinersen or evaluate them as an add-on therapy to nusinersen.

### Surface-enabled propulsion and control of colloidal microwheels [^112qMnKo]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

We define a weighted angular frequency, ω *, as

and then can write the rolling velocity as

Microwheel rolling

Figure 3a shows the rolling velocity, V, as a function of a weighted angular frequency, ω *, that accounts for microwheel size and angular frequency. The scaling argument presented above predicts a slope of (3 mg /32 η) μ * on plots of V versus ω *. The data show good agreement with this scaling for weighted angular frequencies below 200 rad s −1. Above this the scaling deviates from the data, likely because the assumption that the wheel velocity is much greater than the fluid velocity is no longer valid. Wheels roll along the surface at speeds of up to 90 μm s −1 with applied field frequencies up to 50 Hz over the range 0 < θ c < 90°. Even single particles roll as long as the surface-parallel component of the rotational axis is non-zero. Wheels composed of 2, 3, 7 and even 19 particles, though not strictly round, exhibit smooth motion as they rapidly spin and translate across flat surfaces for values of B z 0 /B 0 < 2.5 (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Movies 3–6); at higher values motion becomes unstable. Velocities > 120 μm s −1 were achieved with dimers and 19-mers at higher amplitude fields, but observation times were limited due to the size of the field-of-view.

As the data condense to a single line at low to moderate ω in Fig. 3, we can conclude that friction is not stick-slip and wheel speeds increase with wheel size for a given angular frequency due both to the increased load and increased fluid velocities near the wall. A useful feature of this approach is that different sized microwheels, and thus different speeds for a given field rotation frequency, can be assembled from the same building blocks by changing the bulk colloid concentration. In fact, wheels composed of particle numbers other than those studied in Fig. 3 do roll as well; however, structural isomers in these systems make quantification difficult.

### The relationship of the FOUR score to patient outcome: a systematic review [^113tYTY6]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality appraisal

Of the 40 records, only two achieved overall low risk of bias, 25 have moderate risk of bias, and 13 have high risk of bias (Table 3). The overview of the risk of bias of records differentiated by the reported outcome is shown below (Table 4).

Table 3.
Quality Assessment for Included Records

Table 4.
Overview of Risk of Bias of Studies for each Outcome Reported by the Respective Studies

Mortality

Among the included studies, 36 measured mortality as the primary outcome. Of these studies, 25 described in-hospital mortality, as the end point, 5 investigated mortality only up to 2 weeks post-event, and 11 studies explored longer-term mortality up to 3–6 months. The mortality rate between included studies varied widely — from 7.8%to 70% — among studies where FOUR score was assessed within 24 h of admission. Studies using later time points of FOUR score assessment reported mortality within the above range (Supplementary Table S3). The highly variable mortality rate is likely a consequence of wide study methodological heterogeneity and thus no statistical association of timing of assessment and mortality was tested for.

Area under the curve

Of the same 36 studies reporting mortality, 30 reported the discriminative ability of FOUR score in predicting mortality by AUC.

a) Short-term (up to 2 weeks) and in-hospital mortality

Twenty-three studies reported short-term and in-hospital mortality, with 16 studies having found FOUR score to be good or excellent (AUC value, > 0.80) in predicting in-hospital and short-term mortality, six of which have high risk of bias whereas the remaining are of moderate risk (Fig. 2). Both Kocak 2012and Mansour 2015found that for in-hospital and short-term mortality, FOUR score assessed at 3 days post-admission has higher predictive value (AUC > 0.90) compared to assessment in the first day of admission (AUC < 0.80), with non-overlapping confidence intervals which may suggest significant difference.

### From the editors' desk: confronting costs of care at the end of life [^114QwmGK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Most experts agree that the current rate of rise of health care costs is unsustainable. The good news, however, is that there is an emerging consensus among policymakers over what needs to be done: realign financial incentives; reinvigorate primary care; support more informed, patient-centered decision making; develop a more robust evidence base of comparative effectiveness; create standards for electronic health records; invest in public health. In addition, many feel that excessive tests, consultations, and procedures in the last year of life contribute not only to higher costs but to diminished quality of care. However, these concerns were caricatured by conservative pundits and politicians, who portrayed hospital ethics boards as "death panels" and ultimately ensured that end-of life care was exiled from the health care reform agenda.

Why focus on the end of life? Because about one-quarter of Medicare spending occurs during the last year of life, because there is considerable geographic variation in this spending, and perhaps because, as Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer has pointed out, most dying patients are elderly, and a slowing or reversal of illness in an 85-year-old saves fewer life-years and therefore produces less social utility than the same slowing or reversal in a 35-year-old. (Readers interested in the debate over utilitarian versus categorical ethics might like Michael Sandel's popular Harvard course, found at).

In this month's issue of JGIM, several articles deal with the care of patients who have serious medical conditions and who may be nearing the end of life. In her Text and Context column, Roslyn Weaver provides a touchstone for teaching the principles of clear communication, building safe and reliable systems, and breaking bad news. As Weaver explains, Dr. Trent, a principal character in LM Montgomery's The Blue Castle, mistakenly writes to his patient Valancy Stirling telling her she has a fatal disease; paradoxically this frees her to explore the more adventuresome side of her nature. Not knowing this, Trent feels awful about the possible effects of his error on Valancy, but shrugs off the miscommunication to the other patient involved in the miscue, Jane Sterling. She remains blissfully unaware of her terminal diagnosis through the moment of her death two months later.

### CaRdiac arrest survival score (CRASS) – A tool to predict good neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114jxvh7]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to develop a score to predict the outcome for patients brought to hospital following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

All patients recorded in the German Resuscitation Registry (GRR) who suffered OHCA 2010–2017, who had ROSC or ongoing CPR at hospital admission were included. The study population was divided into development (2010–2016: 7985) and validation dataset (2017: 1806). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to derive the score. The probability of hospital discharge with good neurological outcome was defined as 1/(1 + exp(−X)), where X is the weighted sum of independent variables.

Results

The following variables were found to have a significant positive (+) or negative (-) impact: age 61–70 years (-0.5), 71–80 (-0.9), 81–90 (-1.3) and ≥ 91 (-2.3); initial PEA (-0.9) and asystole (-1.4); presumable trauma (-1.1); mechanical CPR (-0.3); application of adrenalin > 0 - < 2 mg (-1.1), 2 - < 4 mg (-1.6), 4 - < 6 mg (-2.1), 6 - < 8 mg (-2.5) and ≥ 8 mg (-2.8); pre emergency status without previous disease (+0.5) or minor disease (+0.2); location at nursing home (-0.6), working place/school (+0.7), doctor's office (+0.7) and public place (+0.3); application of amiodarone (+0.4); hospital admission with ongoing CPR (-1.9) or normotension (+0.4); witnessed arrest (+0.6); time from collapse until start CPR 2 - < 10 min (-0.3) and ≥ 10 min (-0.5); duration of CPR < 5 min (+0.6). The AUC in the development dataset was 0.88 (95% CI 0.87–0.89) and in the validation dataset 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90).

Conclusion

The CaRdiac Arrest Survival Score (CRASS) represents a tool for calculating the probability of survival with good neurological function for patients brought to hospital following OHCA.

### Prognostic risk-stratified score for predicting mortality in hospitalized patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: nationally representative data from 2007 to 2012 [^1172FWKE]. Transfusion (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "French mortality score in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (MITS score)" for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

The French mortality score in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, also known as the MITS score, is a clinical tool designed to predict in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The score is calculated based on seven key components: age equal to or greater than 60 years, platelet transfusion, acute or chronic renal failure or need of hemodialysis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, central nervous system hemorrhage, and arterial thrombosis. Each component contributes to the overall score, which ranges from 0 to 7 or more.

The MITS score provides a quantitative measure of mortality risk, with higher scores indicating a greater risk. For instance, a score of 0 corresponds to a 0.72% risk of in-hospital mortality, while a score of 7 or more corresponds to a risk greater than 60%. This scoring system allows clinicians to stratify patients based on their risk and guide clinical decision-making accordingly.

The French MITS score calculator is a tool designed to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) through seven clinical factors. Here's how it works:

1. **Inputs and Scoring**: The calculator uses seven yes-or-no questions based on the patient's clinical status:

- **Age 60 years or older**: 2 points
- **Platelet transfusion**: 1 point
- **Acute or chronic renal failure, or need for hemodialysis**: 1 point
- **Myocardial infarction**: 1 point
- **Ischemic stroke**: 1 point
- **Central nervous system hemorrhage**: 3 points
- **Arterial thrombosis**: 3 points

2. **Score Calculation**: Each affirmative answer adds the corresponding points for that factor. The total score is the sum of these points and can range from 0 to 12.

3. **Interpreting the Score**:
- **Score of 0**: The risk of in-hospital mortality is 0.72%.
- **Score of 1**: The risk is 5.47%.
- **Score of 2**: The risk is 8.33%.
- **Score of 3**: The risk is 19.6%.
- **Score of 4**: The risk is 26.67%.
- **Score of 5**: The risk is 35.36%.
- **Score of 6**: The risk is 60%.
- **Score of 7 or higher**: The risk is greater than 60%.

Using these scores, medical professionals can assess the severity and mortality risk of TTP in a structured way, guiding informed decisions about patient care.

### Why lockdown of the elderly is not ageist and why levelling down equality is wrong [^112CuHAG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Symbolic value of equality

One objection to this proposed policy is that, as Blunkett said, this risks stigmatising a group. Equality has a symbolic value. As Hellman argues, discrimination on the basis of a particular attribute is wrong because it demeans the person affected. It demonstrates a lack of respect for them as an individual. The symbolic value of equality may also be seen in the objections to discriminating on the basis of age for admission to intensive care units; there is symbolic value in valuing all lives equally and those who oppose such measures argue that this symbolic value is greater than any relative benefits. But how much should we pay for this symbolic value and to protect one group at the expense of another group?

Often quite a significant amount. I remember a few years ago my 82-year-old mother being directed into a body scanner at Heathrow. Although some staff deny it, these scanners use ionising radiation. This increases cancer risk. They reassure you by telling you it is the same amount or less than you would receive from cosmic radiation on the same flight. But flights are dangerous too. Over the whole population (billions) being screened, some small number of people probably get cancer from this exposure.

And of course, it would be easy to tell that there was virtually zero chance of my 82-year-old mother being a terrorist. You could plug in her data from several sources and come up with a probability that is next to zero (age, sex, religion, travel history, places where she has lived, etc). But we do not profile people — we expose everyone to radiation. The reason for that is equality and avoidance of stigmatisation.

David Blunkett also refers to terrorism in his letter:

'In 2001, I was the home secretary. There was a strong feeling among my government colleagues that the country must face down terrorism the way that it faced down the Nazis during the Blitz — by being resilient… It looked at the balance required between protecting human rights, on the one hand, and avoiding unnecessary risk and panic on the other'.

### Prognostic models [^117HaB18]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

An appreciation of prognosis is essential for effective clinical practice, in neurology as in other fields. Predicting risk of a poor outcome in individuals, or at least in well-defined groups of individuals, is necessary to properly inform patients about what the future holds for them, and the likely benefits of treatment. Despite the various pitfalls in the derivation and validation of prognostic models (or scores), there are an increasing number of useful models available to help patients and clinicians in routine neurology practice. This article considers how such models are best derived, and how their reliability should be assessed, drawing on examples from various different neurological disorders.

### Rasburicase vs. allopurinol: mortality in hematological malignancies post anti-hyperuricemic therapy-real-world study [^114cYjoE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

There was a significant improvement in the density of overall standardized differences before and after matching. This indicated most of the standardized differences between the two groups were clustered near 0 (Figure 4).

Fig. 4
Pre- and post-matching density of standardized differences

Similar evidence of match is provided by a jitter plot in Figure 5, showing the distribution of matched rasburicase vs. allopurinol scores (middle two rows) as visually similar.

Fig. 5
Distribution of propensity scores

Figure 6 shows that the absolute difference in means was normalized by the averaging of allopurinol and rasburicase standard deviations before matching. The standardized means differ by up to almost 60% for unmatched covariates.

Fig. 6
Standardized differences minimized

Comparing the 13 patients who died with 269 patients who did not, no significant difference in mean UA (13.5 mg/dL vs. 11.4 mg/dL, respectively) was found. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone regimen (R-CHOP) was the predominant Tx among those who did not die (15%, n = 41). Only 1 (7.7%) of 13 patients who died received R-CHOP. Dates of death were not reported in the 2021 anonymized chart study, but there were sufficient data points regarding HUA Tx duration as well as the number of days or weeks between Tx and the physician's entry of the patient cases in the survey to determine that 7 patients died within 2 weeks or less of allopurinol (n = 6) or rasburicase (n = 1) monotherapy (timing could not be established for the other 6).

### Does predicting who will fall tomorrow tell you who is frail today? [^116wW8r8]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

A frequently raised question about frailty indices is whether certain variables should be weighted more heavily than others. In this commentary, we outline some of the pros and cons of weighting. Weighting can improve prediction of outcomes, but it also carries risks: underestimating the effects of existing interventions, prioritising factors that may not align with classical frailty phenotypes, and the risk that a model will not predict outcomes in the same way in a new population as it did in the one it was trained on. We offer an alternative perspective that frailty indices need not be seen only as prediction tools. Used as latent measures of health, they can support and complement clinical assessment. The true test of any data-derived frailty measure should be whether clinicians find it helpful in practice and whether its use can reduce the rate of adverse outcomes in a randomised controlled trial.

### Which patients with advanced respiratory disease die in hospital? A 14-year population-based study of trends and associated factors [^111EB1Lx]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest the EoLC Strategy contributed to tangible impact in reducing hospital deaths for people with respiratory diseases. However, the effects were mainly for people with few or no co-morbidities; people with two or more co-morbidities had no reduction in hospital deaths over the period. Most healthcare systems are dominantly established for people with individual diseases. Many different specialists can become involved during multimorbidity. This can be duplicative, burdensome and unsafe for patients because of poor coordination and integration, with some patients inversely receiving less care. Another reason might be that the more medical specialists are involved, the higher the chance of the family doctor or general practitioner (GP) having a minor role in the care of the patient, thus being less often aware of the progressive stage of the diseases. Supporting patients with multimorbidity needs knowledge and expertise that a GP may not always have, which may be a reason for why GPs may refer to hospital during crises. These factors could increase hospital admissions and length of stay.

Multimorbidity is increasing globally. In the UK, the number of people with three or more long-term conditions is predicted to rise from 1.9 million in 2008 to 2.9 million in 2018, requiring a major increase in healthcare expenditure. It was particularly concerning that, in our data, there was no fall in hospital deaths for people with multimorbidity, and the disparity widened over time. Therefore, it is essential that future strategies for end of life and palliative care directly address the issue of multimorbidity, and this may require different approaches.

Median survival for people with IPD is poor, at between 2 and 5 years from diagnosis. Prognosis in COPD is better, though around one third die within 3 years following diagnosis. However, it is difficult to prognosticate, as many people have frequent exacerbations of their disease and encounter life-threatening events before death occurs. Prognostication, especially during the last year of life, is problematic when patients have multimorbidity. Patients with COPD and IPD often suffer refractory breathlessness, which can result in panic and distress. Breathlessness is often unpredictable and episodic, with multiple other symptoms that can result in accident and emergency attendance. Managing refractory breathlessness and issues in multimorbidity is therefore more complex and time consuming than for single conditions, especially responding to the needs for 'joined-up' co-ordination, communication and symptom management. Organising some specific treatments, such as non-invasive ventilation in COPD, also may take time in the community.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol is a predictor of survival in cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective study [^1135WHJz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Survival

In the derivation cohort, 66 of the 629 (10.5%) patients died during study observation, with early death rate (16 of 66, 24.2%) occurring within the first five days. In the test set, 34 of the 314 (10.8%) patients died during study observation, with early death rate (7 of 34, 20.5%) occurring within the first five days.

Mortality increased with increasing N-CGIB score. The final selected cutoff value accurately discriminated patients in 3 subgroups with distinct prognosis: a low-risk group (N-CGIB score below -3), whose in-hospital mortality was 1.7%; an intermediate-risk group (N-CGIB score range from -3 to -1), with a 12.3% mortality; and a high-risk group (N-CGIB score more than -1) associated with a 56.9% or greater predicted risk. Comparable results were found in the validation set with a significant decrease in 6-week probability of survival: 1.1%, 17.9%, and 54.2%, respectively. (Fig. 2 a, b).

Probability of 6-week survival in cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding according to the developed model in the derivation and validation sets. N-CGIB identified 3 risk groups: low-risk (< -3), medium-risk (−3 to −1), high-risk (> −1). The probability of survival progressively and significantly decreased across groups, both in the derivation (A) and validation (b) sets (P < 0.001)

On Kaplan–Meier analysis, baseline HDL-C values ≤ 0.54 mmol/L were associated with markedly lower 6-week survival in the derivation cohorts (Fig. 3 a), and validation cohorts (Fig. 3 b).

### Impact of a prospective feedback loop aimed at reducing non-beneficial treatments in older people admitted to hospital and potentially nearing the end of life. A cluster stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial [^116KnkFK]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

The reasons why non-beneficial treatments are provided at the end of life are complex and arise from clinician factors, patient factors and hospital factors. The difficult but necessary conversations with patients around goals of care require high-level clinical skills and experience, and discussions can be difficult even with older patients who are ready to die. Avoiding these conversations and not putting care plans in place means that hospitalised older patients can be poorly prepared for their approaching death and are at-risk of experiencing unnecessary suffering. Many patients would have had a better death in a palliative care setting where they could say goodbye to their loved ones and have their pain managed. The recent Lancet Commission on the Value of Death identified the need to change the mindset and rules of healthcare systems, so that death 'transcends' healthcare and that healthcare services are accountable for their relief of suffering and management of good deaths.

The Intervention for Appropriate Care and Treatment trial

The primary outcome measure of the Intervention for Appropriate Care and Treatment (InterACT) trial was the proportion of patients with one or more ICU admissions.

Secondary outcomes of the trial were:

length of hospital stay and discharge outcome
time to hospital re-admission
time to first documented clinician-led care review discussion
time to care directive measures
time to palliative care referral
time to medical emergency call
changes in admission and treatment costs
cost of implementing the prospective feedback loop intervention
extent and fidelity of intervention implementation, impact and contextual barriers and enablers of the feedback loop intervention.

This paper reports the trial's primary outcome and secondary outcomes 2, 3 and 7. We have previously reported on secondary outcomes 4, 5 and 6 using data immediately available on trial completion. The cost-consequence analysis, outcomes 8 and 9, will be published separately, and the process evaluation results (outcome 10) are available. ICU admission was chosen as the primary outcome due to the increasing number of ICU admissions of older patients and the potential for highly invasive treatments that unnecessarily increase suffering at the end of life. An observational study on the end of life in Australian hospitals reviewed 1,692 in-hospital deaths, with 356 (21%) of these in ICU and 27% of these ICU deaths in patients 75 years and older. Another Australian study of older people admitted to ICU found that 39% of patients aged 50 or over were frail and 19% of these patients died in hospital.

### Model of a queuing approach for patient accrual in phase 1 oncology studies [^111pDWSU]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Phase 1 cancer studies, which guide dose selection for subsequent studies, are almost 3 times more prevalent than phase 3 studies and have a median study duration considerably longer than 2 years, which constitutes a major component of drug development time.

Objective

To discern a method to reduce the duration of phase 1 studies in adult and pediatric cancer studies without violating risk limits by better accommodating the accrual and evaluation process (or queue).

Design

The process modeled, the phase 1 queue (IQ), includes patient interarrival time, screening, and dose-limiting toxicity evaluation. For this proof of principle, the rules of the 3+3 and rolling 6 phase 1 designs were modified to improve patient flow through the queue without exceeding the maximum risk permitted in the parent designs. The resulting designs, the IQ 3+3 and the IQ rolling 6, were each compared with their parent design by simulations in 12 different scenarios.

Main Outcomes and Measures

(1) The time from study opening to determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), (2) the number of patients treated to determine the MTD, and (3) the association of the design with the dose selected as the MTD.

Results

Based on 800 simulations, for all 12 scenarios considered, the IQ 3+3 and the IQ rolling 6 designs were associated with reduced expected study durations compared with the parent design. The expected IQ 3+3 reduction ranged from 1.6 to 10.4 months (with 3.7 months for the standard scenario), and the expected reduction associated with IQ rolling 6 ranged from 0.4 to 10.5 months (with 3.4 months for the standard scenario). The increase in the mean number of patients treated in the IQ 3+3 compared with the 3+3 ranged from 0.6 to 3.2 patients. No increase in the number of patients was associated with the IQ rolling 6 compared with the rolling 6 design. The probability of selecting a dose level as the MTD changed by less than 3% for all dose levels and scenarios in both parent designs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that IQ designs were associated with reduced mean duration of phase 1 studies compared with their parent designs without changing the risk limits or MTD selection operating characteristics. These approaches have been successfully implemented in both hematology and solid tumor phase 1 studies.

### Developing clinical prediction models: a step-by-step guide [^1136gn22]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Step 9: Assess the performance of prediction models

General concepts in assessing model performance

We assess the predictive performance of the modelling strategies explored in step 8. Specifically, we contrast predictions with observed outcomes for people in a dataset to calculate performance measures. For continuous outcomes like blood pressure this is straightforward: observed outcomes can be directly compared with predictions because they are on the same scale. When dealing with binary or survival outcomes, the situation becomes more complex. In these cases, prediction models might give the probability of an event occurring for each individual while observed outcomes are binary (event or no event) or involve time-to-event data with censoring. Consequently, more advanced methods are required.

Dimensions of prediction performance

Prediction performance has two dimensions, and it is essential to assess them both, particularly for binary and survival outcomes (see glossary in table 1).

Discrimination — for continuous outcomes, discrimination refers to the model's ability to distinguish between patients with different outcomes: good discrimination means that patients with higher predicted values also had higher observed outcome values. For binary outcomes, good discrimination means that the model separates people at high risk from those at low risk. For time-to-event outcomes, discrimination refers to the ability of the model to rank patients according to their survival; that is, patients predicted to survive longer survived longer.
Calibration relates to the agreement between observed and predicted outcome values. For continuous outcomes, good calibration means that predicted values do not systematically overestimate or underestimate observed values. For binary and survival outcomes, good calibration means the model does not overestimate or underestimate risks.

Discrimination and calibration are essential when evaluating prediction models. A model can have good discrimination by accurately distinguishing between risk levels, but still have poor calibration owing to a mismatch between predicted and observed probabilities. Moreover, a well calibrated model might have poor discrimination. Thus, a robust prediction model should have good discrimination and calibration. Box 1 outlines measures for assessing model performance.

### Three learning stages and accuracy-efficiency tradeoff of restricted boltzmann machines [^1178ec55]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a versatile architecture for unsupervised machine learning that can in principle approximate any target probability distribution with arbitrary accuracy. However, the RBM model is usually not directly accessible due to its computational complexity, and Markov-chain sampling is invoked to analyze the learned probability distribution. For training and eventual applications, it is thus desirable to have a sampler that is both accurate and efficient. We highlight that these two goals generally compete with each other and cannot be achieved simultaneously. More specifically, we identify and quantitatively characterize three regimes of RBM learning: independent learning, where the accuracy improves without losing efficiency; correlation learning, where higher accuracy entails lower efficiency; and degradation, where both accuracy and efficiency no longer improve or even deteriorate. These findings are based on numerical experiments and heuristic arguments.

Breast cancer risk assessment models — The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 25 good- and fair-quality studies on 18 risk stratification models (n > 5 000 000). Although these models demonstrate good calibration for predicting risk in a population, their discriminatory accuracy to correctly classify individual women who will develop breast cancer over the next 5 years from those who will not is modest at best; the C statistic for most models ranged from 0.55 to 0.65. Models that include breast density, postmenopausal hormone use, and a more extensive family history minimally improve predictive estimates. Most models reported performance slightly better than age alone as a risk predictor, and no studies evaluated optimal ages or frequencies for risk assessment.

### Cervicocerebral atherosclerosis burden increases long-term mortality in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^113iCdVp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The influence of burden of atherosclerosis in the brain supplying arteries on mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is poorly known. We assessed whether total burden of atherosclerosis within cervicocerebral arteries is associated with long‐term mortality.

Methods and Results

A total of 406 patients (median age, 71.8 years; 57.9% male) with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were included and their cervicocerebral arteries imaged with computed tomography angiography. The presence of atherosclerotic findings was scored for 25 artery segments and points were summed as a Cervicocerebral Atherosclerosis Burden (CAB) score, analyzed as quartiles. Data on all‐cause mortality came from Statistics Finland. After a median follow‐up of 7.3 years, 147 (33.5%) patients had died. Compared with surviving patients, those who died had a higher median CAB score (5, interquartile range 2–10 versus 11, 7–16; P < 0.001). Cumulative mortality increased from 8.9% (95% CI, 7.0–10.8) in the lowest to 61.4% (95% CI, 55.4–67.4) in the highest quartile of CAB score. Adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, secondary preventive medication, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, every CAB score point increased probability of death by 3%. Analyzed in quartiles, the highest CAB quartile was associated with a 2.5‐fold likelihood of all‐cause mortality.

Conclusions

The main findings of our study were the increasing mortality with the total burden of computed tomography angiography‐defined atherosclerosis in the brain supplying arteries after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and that the CAB score — integrating this pathology — independently increased all‐cause mortality.

### A medical uncertainty principle [^116K4wxM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Acquisition of diagnostic knowledge and improvement of patient health often are mutually exclusive goals. A perfect understanding of a disease process is only obtained through unrestricted testing that exposes the patient to adverse events and discomfort. In a patient completely undisturbed by test procedures, the physician remains ignorant about the nature of the disease. The interplay of diagnostic knowledge and patient health can be formulated in terms of an uncertainty principle, which allows one to mathematically derive the parameters that influence the balance between the two competing goals. The majority of clinical conditions permit the pursuit of perfect diagnostic knowledge. Occasional medical disasters occur because physicians underestimate the patient's functional reserve or the cumulative toll exerted by multiple tests. Especially in emergency situations or serious illness, the maximum amount of knowledge that can be achieved is far less than perfect. Under such circumstances, the best management option takes into account a "calculated" amount of diagnostic uncertainty.

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^113ENTJm]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary and predominant purpose of the Apgar score has been to assess the status of an infant in the first few minutes after birth. The rationale for such a scoring system is based on the understanding that having difficulties in the transition to extrauterine life is not good for the newborn, i.e. that such difficulties are associated with worse outcomes so identifying these babies could lead to interventions that could mitigate these outcomes. This is supported by the observation that the adoption of the Apgar score did not become widespread, and then universal, until there was evidence that low scores occurred far more frequently in babies who either died or had neurological deficits in the first year of life.

Over the decades, the score has consistently been used as a risk factor in clinical studies. It has been associated not only with an increased incidence of long-term neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy and seizures, but also with a wide variety of conditions such as attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity, permanent dentition, cancer, food allergy, autism spectrum disorder, polycystic kidney disease and amblyopia. The Apgar score is used as often for research into morbidities that manifest in the post-natal period, including all the discharge diagnoses used as short-term outcomes in this current study. Short term outcomes have also been used for all studies that have examined modifications or replacements for the Apgar, and any future such efforts are likely to do the same. It is noteworthy that the NRP does not use the 1- or 5-min Apgar score.

This study used a range of morbidities occurring during the initial hospital stay to determine, first, if a low Apgar score is more frequent in those babies who were given these diagnoses compared to those without the conditions and confirmed previous associations for the risk factors and the various short-term morbidities. We confirmed that low scores at 1 or 5 minutes were significantly associated with the outcomes examined. Of the 10 outcomes and 4 low Apgar score groups, low scores were significant in 38 circumstances; the exceptions were the 5VL score for HypoG and TTNB. When other clinical factors were included in the analysis (Table 3), low scores lost their significance in an additional 9 outcome/score groups. 1L was significant for six, 5VL for eight, and 5L for six outcomes respectively.

### Evaluation of clinical prediction models (part 2): how to undertake an external validation study [^112Ajznf]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Quantifying discrimination performance

Discrimination refers to how well a model's predictions separate between two groups of participants: those who have (or develop) the outcome and those who do not have (or do not develop) the outcome. Therefore, discrimination is only relevant for prediction models of binary and time-to-event outcomes, and not continuous outcomes.

Discrimination is quantified by the concordance (c) statistic (index), and a value of 1 indicates the model has perfect discrimination, while a value of 0.5 indicates the model discriminates no better than chance. For binary outcomes, it is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) curve. It gives the probability that for any randomly selected pair of participants, one with and one without the outcome, the model assigns a higher probability to the participant with the outcome. What constitutes a high c statistic is context specific; in some fields where strong predictors exist, a c statistic of 0.8 might be considered high, but in others where prediction is more difficult, values of 0.6 might be deemed high. The c statistic also depends on the case mix distribution. Presenting an ROC curve over and above the c statistic (AUROC) has very little, if any, benefit. Similarly, providing traditional measures of test accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity are not as relevant for prediction models, because the focus should be on the overall performance of the model's predictions without forcing thresholds to define so-called high and low groups. If thresholds are important for clinical decision making, then clinical utility should be assessed at those thresholds, for example, using net benefit and decision curves (see step 4).

### An official American Thoracic Society / International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Society of Critical Care Medicine / association of organ and procurement organizations / United network of organ sharing statement: ethical and policy considerations in organ donation after circulatory determination of death [^1112at4Z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) — future research priorities indicate that although first-person consent is legally sufficient for all forms of organ donation, it is uncertain what people intend when they express first-person consent to become a deceased organ donor, and further data should be obtained regarding whether people comprehend the distinction between declaring death on neurological or circulatory criteria and whether their preferences for donation are influenced by the distinct processes required by these two pathways to donation; second, it is important to better understand the impact of donation discussions and DCDD procedures on the quality of end-of-life care provided and on bereavement outcomes, and although it is difficult to directly examine the quality of death and dying for terminally ill patients, the experiences of surrogates of recently deceased patients may be used to gauge the quality of end-of-life care; third, more research is needed to understand factors that influence ICU clinicians' participation in DCDD and the barriers they perceive to performing DCDD well, many clinicians perceive substantial deficiencies in their capacity to appropriately manage DCDD donors due to inadequate experience and education, and it is important to identify ways to overcome these deficiencies in perceived self-efficacy; finally, further investigation of the appropriate disposition of DCDD programs is needed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Joint Commission currently require all hospitals to establish and implement protocols for recovering DCDD organs, and although all OPOs have expertise in DCDD and can assist in the donation process, DCDD requires a multidisciplinary approach.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^115Zbk1r]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

If we go further, and abandon the idea that all clusters must begin in the control condition and end in the intervention condition, we arrive at the design in figure 1D, in which all the clusters are randomised to one condition or the other for the duration of the trial — that is, a 'parallel groups' design conducted over the same timescale as our stepped wedge design. This turns out to be the most statistically powerful design we have yet considered. Not all of the clusters receive the intervention within 10 months, but we do not have to leave things like that: we could have an agreement with sites to roll out the intervention to all of them immediately after the 11-month trial period, while we get on with analysing and publishing our results.

But what about that excess power? Could we get away with collecting less data? Figure 1E–G shows designs run over a 6-month interval, still divided into 1 month periods. This shows that we can achieve 86% power with a design that randomises half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control (figure 1G). With a bit more tweaking it may be possible to uncover even more powerful alternative designs, but this is not the point of the present exercise. The point is this: given 10 clusters and a step length of 1 month we might have jumped to the naïve conclusion that we should run a stepped wedge trial lasting 11 months. But this fixed idea would have prevented us from seeing in this instance that we could get the evidence we needed in a much shorter time and with a simpler design — randomising half the clusters to the intervention for 6 months, and half to control — with all sites then being free to receive the intervention (preferentially perhaps) or to go and seek it for themselves.

### Model of a queuing approach for patient accrual in phase 1 oncology studies [^1117aZns]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

We modified the 3 + 3 design and rolling 6 design decisions to better accommodate the phase 1 queue. The modifications were evaluated on the time and number of patients required to determine the MTD while constrained to (1) inherit the maximum level of patient risk associated with the parent design, (2) provide at least an equally rigorous assessment of toxicity, (3) maintain the parent design's operating characteristics with respect to the MTD determination, and (4) revert to the parent design if accrual is slow or the principal investigator chooses to delay securing consent from patients when the queue-based designs permit accrual but the parent design does not.

The respective queue-based modifications (Table 1 and Table 2), are denoted the IQ 3 + 3 and the IQ rolling 6 designs. At any time, on the current dose level, there is the total number of patients enrolled (eg, promised or taking a slot, excluding those deemed inevaluable for DLT determination), the number of DLTs, and the number of patients evaluable. The number evaluable represents patients who were fully assessed and either had a DLT or did not (termed a pass), whereas the difference between total and evaluable numbers represents patients whose evaluations are pending. The column for the 3 + 3 design can been seen as representing the traditional rules: accrue 3 patients, escalate with 0 DLTs, deescalate with 2 DLTs, and expand to 6 patients with 1 DLT (in which 2 or more DLTs results in dose deescalation and 1 DLT in 6 patients results in dose escalation if the next higher dose is open, and the MTD requires 6 patients treated with 1 DLT at most). Both IQ-based modifications can have up to 8 patients per dose level during the escalation phase. In addition, when deescalating, applying the rule that all patients (up to as many as 10 patients, which occurs in < 0.1% of simulations) should not be denied treatment once given a consent form are possible in both IQ designs.

This study aimed to characterize initial clinical presentations of patients served by emergency medical services (EMS) who die following injury, with particular attention to patients with occult ("talk-and-die") presentations.

Methods

This was a population-based, multiregion, mixed-methods retrospective cohort study of fatally injured children and adults evaluated by 94 EMS agencies transporting to 122 hospitals in seven Western US regions from 2006 to 2008. Fatalities were divided into two main groups: occult injuries (talk-and-die; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≥ 13, no cardiopulmonary arrest, and no intubation) versus overt injuries (all other patients). These groups were further subdivided by timing of death: early (< 48 hours) versus late (> 48 hours). We then compared demographic, physiologic, procedural, and injury patterns using descriptive statistics. We also used qualitative methods to analyze available EMS chart narratives for contextual information from the out-of-hospital encounter.

Results

During the 3-year study period, 3,358 persons served by 9-1-1 EMS providers died, with 1,225 (37.1%) in the field, 1,016 (30.8%) early in the hospital, and 1,060 (32.1%) late in the hospital. Of the 2,133 patients transported to a hospital, there were 612 (28.7%) talk-and-die patients, of whom 114 (18.6%) died early. Talk-and-die patients were older (median age, 81 years; interquartile range, 67–87 years), normotensive (median systolic blood pressure, 138 mm Hg; interquartile range, 116–160 mm Hg), commonly injured by falls (71.3%), and frequently (52.4%) died in nontrauma hospitals. Compared with overtly injured patients, talk-and-die patients had relatively fewer serious head injuries (13.7%) but more frequent extremity injuries (20.3% vs. 10.6%) and orthopedic interventions (25.3% vs. 5.0%). EMS personnel often found talk-and-die patients lying on the ground with hip pain or extremity injuries.

Conclusion

Patients served by EMS who "talk-and-die" are typically older adults with falls, transported to nontrauma hospitals, with subtle clinical indications of the severity of their injuries. Improving recognition of talk-and-die patients may avoid fatal outcomes in a portion of these patients.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^1143RW23]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines — scope and principles emphasize that Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual, and that the Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations. The series is based on three principles: each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners; each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process; and each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation, and these practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results.

### Analysing health outcomes [^115uCHa3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

If we cross-classify the absolutist-consequentialist distinction with an intuitive-analytical one we can see that economists probably attract the hostility of those in the other three cells as a result of being analytical consequentialists, as much as because of their concern with "costs". Suggesting that some sources of utility (either "outcome" or "process" in origin) are to be regarded as rights cannot, says the analytical consequentialist, overcome the fact that fulfilling and respecting rights is a resource-consuming activity, one that will inevitably have consequences, in resource-constrained situations, for the fulfillment of the rights of others. Within the analytical consequentialist framework QALY-type measures of health outcome have the unique advantage of allowing technical and allocative efficiency to be addressed simultaneously, while differential weighting of QALYs accruing to different groups means that efficiency and equity can be merged into the necessary single maximand. But what if such key concepts of the analytical consequentialist are not part of the discursive equipment of others? Are they to be disqualified from using them on this ground? Is it ethical for intuition to be privileged in ethical discourse, or is the analyst entitled to "equal opportunities" in the face of "analysisism", the cognitive equivalent of "racism" and "sexism"?

### Structural balance emerges and explains performance in risky decision-making [^112g9q9V]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Table 2
Stability of transition probabilities: L2-Norm distance of the stationary probability distribution from their average is relatively stable

Each state is defined as a vector of 16 probabilities. Stability test shows that at least 83% of transitions in each observed Markov chains are statistically significant compared to the ones computed from randomized networks

Second, examining the final stationary probability distributions associated with each triad configuration (Table 3), we find that the probability associated with being in one of the remaining 13 unbalanced states, excluding the null triad (Table 1), is just 0.03. This compares to a 0.22 probability of being in one of the two classical balanced states (and a ~0.97 probability of being in balanced states allowed based on Davis et al.). In this study, we only use Davis' theoretical deductions from his formal model. Also, we find the distributions of triads are consistently a close match to the stationary distribution over periods. Therefore, the system has very low occurrences of unbalanced states (i.e. near zero) at each period of analysis and is consistent with SBT's predictions by Heider et al. and Davis et al.

Table 3
Stationary distribution of the average Markov chain overall periods

The stationarity of the null triad state suggests that forbidden triads remain in the network

Third, we observe a strong propensity for stability in the "classic" balanced states, 300 and 102, as well as the null triad state, 003 (Table 1), indicating that the trader network has a tendency towards clustering into two or more subgroups. Heider predicted this finding in his seminal work. In particular, Heider writes "if two negative relations are given, balance can be obtained either when the triad relationship is positive or when it is negative, though there appears to be a preference for the positive alternative". Davis subsequently introduced the formal theoretical model, which he called "clustering"that allows for the triad 003. Finally, the overlooked prediction by Heider and Davis in balance theory, turns out to have empirical support in a longitudinal field setting. Further, it suggests that once a triad enters the states of 300 or 102, it has a low probability of transitioning out of its current state. Thus, once traders have reconfigured their ties to a state of structural balance, they remain in these balanced configurations. Similarly, the stationarity of the null triad state suggests that the network of positive attachments remains relatively sparse over time.

Pre-dive medical evaluation and travel preparation for divers — diving is a potentially strenuous activity that can put substantial demands on the cardiovascular system, and serious injury and death are associated with poor physical conditioning; regular, vigorous aerobic and strengthening exercise should be part of a diver's routine before arriving for their pre-dive physical examination and subsequent diving. People with known risk factors for coronary artery disease, including, but not limited to, diabetes, hypertension, family history of heart disease, an abnormal lipid profile, smoking history, and significant frailty index indicators, who wish to either begin a dive program or continue diving, should undergo a physical examination to assess their cardiovascular fitness; this examination might include an electrocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, exercise treadmill test, or echocardiogram, and abnormal findings should be reviewed by an appropriate medical specialist (e.g., cardiologist, pulmonologist) and include a diving medicine physician. During the travel medicine examination, remind divers (and would-be divers) of actions they can take in advance to reduce or eliminate risks, including identifying and assessing potential hazards (e.g., environment, water, and weather conditions, planned depth and bottom time) to help divers make decisions about acceptable risk, preparing an up-to-date emergency action plan, maintaining on-hand first aid supplies (with ample oxygen), and ensuring reliable communication devices. Using correct and well-maintained protective equipment, diving with supervision, and ensuring that medical care is available in the event of an emergency are additional controls that divers can implement, and a diver should never feel compelled to make a dive, especially if feeling unwell or if conditions are unsafe. Of special note, many dive operators routinely screen clients by requiring a medical statement signed by the diver's physician with approval to dive; divers should communicate with their dive operator ahead of travel to acquire the necessary form to share with their personal physician, and by being prepared with properly signed documentation upon arrival at their dive destination, the traveling diver can forestall denial of dive privileges. In the event of an abnormal finding, the condition needs to be evaluated by their physician as to whether that condition is compatible with diving before travel to the dive site, and guidance can be obtained on both the DAN (https://www.dan.org) and Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS; https://www.uhms.org) websites, with the option of contacting DAN directly if further help is needed.

### Dynamics of ranking [^113GmTqL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Virtually anything can be and is ranked; people, institutions, countries, words, genes. Rankings reduce complex systems to ordered lists, reflecting the ability of their elements to perform relevant functions, and are being used from socioeconomic policy to knowledge extraction. A century of research has found regularities when temporal rank data is aggregated. Far less is known, however, about how rankings change in time. Here we explore the dynamics of 30 rankings in natural, social, economic, and infrastructural systems, comprising millions of elements and timescales from minutes to centuries. We find that the flux of new elements determines the stability of a ranking: for high flux only the top of the list is stable, otherwise top and bottom are equally stable. We show that two basic mechanisms - displacement and replacement of elements - capture empirical ranking dynamics. The model uncovers two regimes of behavior; fast and large rank changes, or slow diffusion. Our results indicate that the balance between robustness and adaptability in ranked systems might be governed by simple random processes irrespective of system details.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^116vzj7L]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### The selection and use of outcome measures in palliative and end-of-life care research: the MORECare international consensus workshop [^115Mu6AR]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Design

We used the MORECare Transparent Expert Consultation method, which incorporates consensus methods of nominal group and consensus survey. The Transparent Expert Consultation comprised a staged process: Stage I — identifying critical issues from the literature; Stage II — a workshop with experts on the issues using nominal group technique to generate recommendations; and Stage III — an online consensus survey to prioritize and identify areas of contention/uncertainty (Fig. 1).

Stage I: Identifying Critical Issues

Critical issues on selecting and using outcome measures in palliative and EOL care were identified from systematic reviews of intervention studiesand outcome measurement. The workshop and consensus survey focused on three critical questions:
1 What are the properties of the best primary outcome measures for evaluation of palliative and EOL care services?
2 How can we best enhance the validity of proxy-reported outcome data?
3 When are the optimal time points to collect outcome data to evaluate the effectiveness of service models in palliative and EOL care?

Stage II: Workshop

Participants received a pre-workshop briefing pack detailing the aim, critical questions, and workshop format. The workshop format comprised presentations on the MORECare project and the project's interface with the PRISMA/EAPC Taskforce, followed by three structured groups of seven to 13 participants each focused on one of the critical questions. The group structure used a modified nominal group facilitated and scribed by members of the MORECare and PRISMA projects. The facilitators guided participants through a structured process of: 1) brief discussion, 2) individual writing of recommendations and ranking, and 3) individuals in turn reading out their highest ranked recommendations until individual lists were exhausted (or time exceeded). The scribes wrote the recommendations and ranking on flip-charts, and each small group discussed and agreed on the final priority order, which they presented and discussed with the whole group. Participants listed and ranked recommendations from one to five (highest to lowest) on structured A4 sheets detailing the respective group question, the ranking scale and boxes to list recommendations, rank, and detail rationale.

Stage III: Consensus Survey

Recommendations were posted online to the workshop participants (excluding the facilitators and scribes) and members of the MORECare Project Advisory Group. Participants received a personalized e-mail invitation and reminder after two weeks. The online participants ranked, from one to nine (strongly disagree to strongly agree), the extent they agreed with a recommendation and used free-text spaces to comment on each recommendation.

### Outcome criteria in smoking cessation trials: proposal for a common standard [^114LEvuz]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Smoking cessation treatment is now integrated into many health-care systems and a major research effort is under way to improve current success rates. Until now results from randomized clinical trials have been reported in many different ways, leading to problems of interpretation. We propose six standard criteria comprising the 'Russell Standard' (RS). These criteria are applicable to trials of cessation aids where participants have a defined target quit date and there is face-to-face contact with researchers or clinic staff, as follows. (1) Follow-up for 6 months (RS6) or 12 months (RS12) from the target quit date or the end of a predefined 'grace period'; (2) self-report of smoking abstinence over the whole follow-up period allowing up to five cigarettes in total; (3) biochemical verification of abstinence at least at the 6-month or 12-month follow-up point; (4) use of an 'intention-to-treat' approach in which data from all randomized smokers are included in the analysis unless they have died or moved to an untraceable address (participants who are included in the analysis are counted as smokers if their smoking status at the final follow-up cannot be determined); (5) following-up 'protocol violators' and using their true smoking status in the analysis; and (6) collecting follow-up data blind to smokers' allocation to trial group. We believe that these criteria provide the best compromise between practicability and surrogacy for long-term cessation and will enable meaningful comparison between studies. There may be good reasons why other outcome criteria would also be reported, and studies that involve interventions with special groups or where there is no designated target quit date or face to face contact would need to adapt these criteria accordingly.
