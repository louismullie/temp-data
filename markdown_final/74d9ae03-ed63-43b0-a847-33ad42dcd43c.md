## Question

What is the use of abacavir in breastfeeding?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of abacavir in breastfeeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and what the FDA says about abacavir and breastfeeding. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic data on abacavir transfer into breast milk and infant exposure. Next, I will review HIV transmission risk during breastfeeding and how maternal ART modifies that risk. After that, I should check infant safety data and the issue of subtherapeutic exposure and resistance. Then, I will compare international and U.S. guideline positions and where they converge or diverge. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical recommendation with monitoring and counseling points, ensuring I confirm where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. Multiple FDA labels consistently state that women with HIV should not breastfeed while taking abacavir, primarily because of the risk of HIV-1 transmission and the potential for adverse reactions and resistance in breastfed infants, even though abacavir is detectable in human milk, which is a pharmacokinetic fact rather than a safety endorsement [^114fpV7S] [^1179MGfH] [^1156HzDF].

> Wait, let me verify the lactation pharmacokinetics before jumping to conclusions. The Mma Bana study found abacavir in breast milk with a median milk-to-plasma ratio around 0.85, and abacavir was detectable in the plasma of some breastfeeding infants, with an estimated relative infant dose around 0.34%, indicating measurable but generally low exposure. I should confirm that these are observational data and not designed to prove safety of infant exposure per se [^114BCzbf] [^113DzkSZ]. Neonatal PK data also show higher exposure to a single 8 mg/kg dose than in older infants, reinforcing that developmental pharmacology matters for infant risk assessment, even if those neonatal data are not lactation-specific [^114Bqje5].

> Hold on, I should verify the transmission risk context. Without maternal ART, breastfeeding-associated HIV transmission is roughly 15–20% over 2 years. With sustained maternal virologic suppression to less than 50 copies/mL, the risk drops below 1%, but it is not zero, and transmission has been documented despite suppression, which means risk mitigation does not equal risk elimination [^113vD2Vn] [^116Msxxz] [^113c9bqG]. Let me also double-check the specific abacavir-containing regimen signal: in the Botswana randomized trial of maternal triple NRTI therapy including abacavir, two lactational transmissions occurred in the NRTI arm despite high maternal suppression, which cautions against assuming zero risk even with effective maternal ART [^113HiUZV] [^113c9bqG].

> I need to check infant safety and resistance concerns. The most specific toxicity signal for abacavir in infants is hypersensitivity, which requires HLA-B✱5701 screening before use. This is well-established in pediatrics and applies to infants exposed to abacavir via breast milk as well, so theoretical or low-level exposure still carries the same mechanistic risk, even if absolute incidence is uncertain in this context [^1157vaRM]. But wait, what if low-level drug exposure in breast milk is actually prophylactic rather than harmful? Subtherapeutic levels can select for resistance if HIV acquisition occurs, and multiclass resistance has been described in infants despite maternal triple-drug prophylaxis, so the net effect of low-level abacavir exposure is not clearly beneficial and could be harmful if infection happens [^116Ja6vq] [^116F9EmT].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. In the United States, replacement feeding is recommended for mothers with HIV given safe, accessible alternatives and the inability to reduce transmission risk to zero with breastfeeding; infant prophylaxis regimens are available, but they do not convert breastfeeding into a risk-free strategy, and they do not specifically endorse abacavir exposure through breastfeeding [^112skmwo] [^116UJmQD]. By contrast, in many low- and middle-income country settings, breastfeeding is commonly recommended with maternal ART and infant prophylaxis to balance infectious disease risks, yet even in those contexts, infant prophylaxis regimens generally do not include abacavir and prioritize agents with stronger breastfeeding safety and efficacy data such as nevirapine or lamivudine [^113uidDk] [^114jzmat]. Let me reconsider the abacavir role here: the absence of abacavir from standard breastfeeding prophylaxis reflects limited infant-specific safety and lack of programmatic experience relative to alternatives, not proof of harm per se [^116rKgqj].

> I should double-check whether abacavir is used in infants at all, because that might seem contradictory at first glance. Abacavir is approved and recommended for treatment of HIV in infants and children aged 3 months and older, and meta-analyses support its pediatric safety and efficacy when used as therapeutic dosing, but that is distinct from exposing uninfected infants to abacavir via breast milk for prophylaxis, where benefit is unproven and risk of hypersensitivity remains a concern [^114fpV7S] [^112FggzC]. So the pediatric approval does not translate into endorsement for breastfeeding-related infant exposure, which is a key distinction I need to keep clear [^112skmwo].

> Let me synthesize the clinical recommendation now. Abacavir should not be used as a strategy to enable breastfeeding, and mothers with HIV who are taking abacavir should be counseled to avoid breastfeeding in settings where safe replacement feeding is feasible, consistent with FDA labeling and U.S. guidelines, due to persistent transmission risk and potential infant adverse effects including hypersensitivity and resistance selection [^114fpV7S] [^112skmwo]. If breastfeeding is contemplated in exceptional circumstances, this should occur under specialist supervision with shared decision-making, strict maternal virologic monitoring, and infant prophylaxis using agents with established breastfeeding safety and dosing, recognizing that abacavir is not a preferred prophylactic component and that even with optimal maternal suppression, transmission risk remains nonzero [^116uqZTW] [^1153xcjy] [^113G3Sq5].

> Next, I should review infant monitoring if exposure occurs. Infants exposed to breast milk from mothers with HIV should undergo virologic testing at birth, 14–21 days, 1–2 months, and 4–6 months, with additional testing every 3 months during breastfeeding and at 4–6 weeks and 4–6 months after cessation, and clinicians should consult experts or the National Perinatal HIV Hotline for individualized plans and when new maternal viremia is detected [^112PmmfJ] [^11428yen] [^112Q3LSN]. I need to ensure that any decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding after new maternal viremia is addressed promptly, with replacement feeding initiated when HIV RNA is 200 copies/mL or higher and presumptive infant therapy considered per guideline algorithms, given the increased transmission risk in that scenario [^1166FrK2] [^1176sEsV].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Abacavir is present in breast milk and is detectable in some breastfeeding infants, maternal ART including abacavir reduces but does not eliminate HIV transmission through breastfeeding, and FDA labeling instructs that mothers with HIV should not breastfeed while taking abacavir. Therefore, abacavir has no endorsed prophylactic role in breastfeeding, and its use should not be leveraged to justify breastfeeding in settings where safe alternatives exist, with all decisions grounded in shared decision-making and expert guidance if exceptions are considered [^114BCzbf] [^113G3Sq5] [^114fpV7S] [^112skmwo].

---

Abacavir is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers with HIV because it is present in breast milk and may expose infants to risks such as hypersensitivity, mitochondrial toxicity, and drug resistance [^114BCzbf] [^114fpV7S]. The FDA and CDC advise that **HIV-positive mothers should not breastfeed** [^114fpV7S] due to the risk of HIV transmission and potential adverse effects from maternal ART, including abacavir [^114fpV7S] [^1147Pwum]. If breastfeeding is unavoidable, use infant prophylaxis and monitor closely; however, abacavir is not a preferred prophylactic agent [^116uqZTW]. Mothers should be counseled to use formula or donor milk to **eliminate HIV transmission risk** [^117DErhn].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of abacavir in breastfeeding

Abacavir is **present in breast milk**, with a milk-to-plasma ratio of approximately 0.85, indicating moderate transfer into breast milk [^114BCzbf]. Infant exposure to abacavir through breast milk is estimated at about 0.34% of the maternal dose, suggesting low but measurable exposure [^114BCzbf].

---

## Potential risks associated with abacavir exposure through breast milk

Although infant exposure to abacavir through breast milk is relatively low, **potential risks** include:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Abacavir is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening. Infants exposed to abacavir through breast milk may be at risk of developing such reactions [^112FggzC].

- **Mitochondrial toxicity**: Abacavir, like other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), has been associated with mitochondrial toxicity, including lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. Although rare, these conditions can be serious and potentially fatal [^115tQWEh].

- **Development of drug resistance**: Infants exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antiretroviral drugs through breast milk may develop drug-resistant HIV strains if they become infected with HIV [^117RwiMV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The FDA and CDC **recommend that HIV-positive mothers not breastfeed** their infants due to the risk of HIV transmission and potential adverse effects from maternal antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir [^114fpV7S] [^1147Pwum]. The FDA explicitly states that mothers receiving abacavir should be instructed not to breastfeed because of the potential for HIV transmission, development of viral resistance, and adverse reactions in breastfed infants [^114fpV7S] [^1179MGfH].

---

## Alternative feeding options

Given the potential risks associated with abacavir exposure through breast milk, **alternative feeding options** should be considered:

- **Formula feeding**: Formula feeding is recommended as a safe and effective alternative to breastfeeding for infants of HIV-positive mothers. Formula feeding eliminates the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk and avoids exposure to maternal antiretroviral drugs [^117DErhn].

- **Donor human milk**: Pasteurized donor human milk from certified milk banks is another safe alternative. Donor milk undergoes rigorous screening and pasteurization processes, significantly reducing the risk of HIV transmission and drug exposure [^116Msxxz].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

If breastfeeding is unavoidable, clinicians should **closely monitor** both mother and infant. This includes regular viral load monitoring to ensure sustained virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) and assessment of maternal adherence to antiretroviral therapy [^116jw3HC]. Provide infant prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs — such as nevirapine or lamivudine — to reduce the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk, and conduct regular clinical assessments for adverse effects, including hypersensitivity reactions and mitochondrial toxicity [^115xnphr] [^1164abbR].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Avoid breastfeeding | - HIV-positive mothers should avoid breastfeeding while receiving abacavir due to potential risks of HIV transmission and adverse effects [^112skmwo] [^114fpV7S] |
| Alternative feeding | - Formula feeding or pasteurized donor human milk are recommended alternatives to breastfeeding [^117DErhn] [^116Msxxz] |
| Monitoring | - If breastfeeding is unavoidable, closely monitor maternal viral load, infant prophylaxis, and adverse effects [^116XptnX] [^115xnphr] |

---

Abacavir is present in breast milk and may expose infants to risks such as hypersensitivity reactions, mitochondrial toxicity, and drug resistance. Therefore, **breastfeeding is not recommended** for HIV-positive mothers receiving abacavir. Alternative feeding options, such as formula feeding or pasteurized donor human milk, should be considered to eliminate the risk of HIV transmission and drug exposure.

Abacavir and Lamivudine: No data are available on the pharmacokinetics of abacavir or lamivudine during pregnancy.

Zidovudine: Zidovudine pharmacokinetics have been studied in a Phase 1 trial of 8 women during the last trimester of pregnancy. As pregnancy progressed, there was no evidence of drug accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of zidovudine were similar to that of nonpregnant adults. Consistent with passive transmission of the drug across the placenta, zidovudine concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery. Although data are limited, methadone maintenance therapy in 5 pregnant women did not appear to alter zidovudine pharmacokinetics. In a nonpregnant adult population, a potential for interaction has been identified [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Infants are considered at low risk of transmission during breastfeeding when (1) maternal antiretroviral therapy is being used while breastfeeding and sustained maternal virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) was achieved for at least 3 months prior to delivery and (2) the provider and patient are confident that maternal ART adherence will be maintained during breastfeeding (AII).

Ethical Concerns Regarding Exposure of Pregnant Women and Their Fetuses to Antiretroviral Drugs Under Development

Although there are clearly ethical considerations when including pregnant and breastfeeding women in clinical trials, it can also be considered unethical not to test new drugs in pregnant women in a controlled setting. In practice, once new drugs are approved in adults, their use rapidly expands to include pregnant and breastfeeding women, exposing more mothers and infants to these potential risks than would have occurred in the context of a clinical trial.

### Infant feeding: emerging concepts to prevent HIV transmission [^113DzkSZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Maternal HIV and/or ART (or other antimicrobials) may affect breastmilk composition and the infant microbiome with potential implications for infant health, growth and development. How this impacts HIV transmission risk remains to be determined.

The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of ART in breastmilk has important implications for transmission, as well as resistance and drug toxicity in breastfeeding infants. A study of 21 mother/infant pairs demonstrated that maternal plasma/breastmilk ratios vary between agents, breastmilk transfer being significant for rilpivirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide and raltegravir but minimal for tenofovir disoproxil, dolutegravir, bictegravir and darunavir/ritonavir. Agents were detectable in infant plasma, below the exposure index of 10% (safety threshold for infant exposure to maternal drugs through breastmilk). Infant plasma concentrations did not necessarily correlate with those in breastmilk.

Maternal/infant immunity may also play a key role. A substudy of the Breastfeeding, Antiretroviral, and Nutrition Study (BAN) found, in the absence of maternal ART, a combination of exposure to maternal HIV strains more susceptible to antibody-dependant cytotoxicity (ADCC) combined with higher infant breadth and potency of ADCC was associated with lower breastmilk transmission. Additional analysis from BAN and the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology 009 (CHAVI009) cohorts has investigated the role of maternal plasma broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bNAb), their impact on viral selection and breastmilk transmission. Results indicated that both multispecific broad activity and uncommon epitope-specific plasma bNAbs may protect against transmission, providing further evidence to direct potential bNAb strategies for prevention of viral transmission.

### Breastfeeding while taking lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a review of the evidence [^113hhF1s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are both active against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Due to its potency, high genetic barrier to resistance, and safety during pregnancy, TDF may be useful to prevent HBV transmission from mother to child, which is the leading cause of transmission globally. Despite the safety record of lamivudine and TDF in pregnancy, the labels for both of these drugs recommend against their use during breastfeeding. In this review, we discuss the data regarding lamivudine and TDF use during pregnancy and breastfeeding and find that the exposure to the drug is lower from breastfeeding than from in utero exposure. Thus, the data do not support the contraindication to their use during breastfeeding.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116G3x1A]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral management of infants with exposure to HIV during breastfeeding — new diagnosis of HIV when breastfeeding: Stop breastfeeding and initiate replacement feeding. Perform infant HIV NAT.a. Initiate presumptive HIV therapy using three-drug regimen of ZDV, 3TC, and DTG.b For infants aged < 4 weeks, ZDV and 3TC plus NVP (treatment dose) or RAL should be used. Duration of 2 to 6 weeks; consensus was not reached by Panel members. If the duration of three-drug regimen is < 6 weeks and the NAT is negative, continue ZDV alone to complete a total of 6 weeks of prophylaxis. An HIV NAT at birth is recommended for all breastfeeding infants. A NAT should be obtained before or immediately after starting ARVs. DTG can be used in infants aged ≥ 4 weeks and weighing ≥ 3 kg. Given limited data, decisions about infant ARV prophylaxis during breastfeeding should be based on shared decision-making with the infant's parents.

### Antiretroviral interventions for preventing breast milk transmission of HIV [^112vZJcJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An estimated 260,000 children under the age of 15 years acquired HIV infection in 2012. As much as 42% of mother-to-child transmission is related to breastfeeding. Antiretroviral prophylaxis for mothers or infants has the potential to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast milk.

Objectives

To determine which antiretroviral prophylactic regimens are efficacious and safe for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding and thereby avert child morbidity and mortality.

Search Methods

Using Cochrane Collaboration search methods in conjunction with appropriate search terms, we identified relevant studies from January 1, 1994 to January 14, 2014 by searching databases including Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed, LILACS, and Web of Science/Web of Social Science.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials in which HIV-infected mothers breastfed their infants, and in which the mothers used antiretroviral prophylaxis while breastfeeding their children or their children received antiretroviral prophylaxis for at least four weeks while breastfeeding, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts of all trials identified were examined independently by two authors. We identified 15,922 references and examined 81 in detail. Data were abstracted independently using a standardized form.

Main Results

Seven RCTs were included in the review. One trial compared triple antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy and breastfeeding with short antiretroviral prophylaxis to given to the mother to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. At 12 months, the risks of HIV transmission, and of HIV transmission or death, were lower, but there was no difference in infant mortality alone in the triple arm versus the short arm. Using the GRADE methodology, evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally low to moderate. One trial compared six months of breastfeeding using zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir versus zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir from 26–34 weeks gestation. At six months, there was no difference in risk of infant HIV infection, infant death, or infant HIV infection or death between the two groups. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally very low to low. One trial of single dose nevirapine versus six weeks of infant zidovudine found the risk of HIV infection at 12 weeks to be greater in the zidovudine arm than in the single dose nevirapine arm. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally very low. One multi-country trial compared single dose nevirapine and six weeks of infant nevirapine. After 12 months, infants in the extended nevirapine group had a lower risk of infant mortality compared with the control. There was no difference in the risk of HIV infection or death or in HIV transmission alone in the extended nevirapine group compared with the control. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally low to moderate. One trial compared single dose nevirapine plus one week zidovudine; the control regimen plus nevirapine up to 14 weeks; or the control regimen with dual prophylaxis up to 14 weeks. At 24 months, the extended nevirapine regimen group had a lower risk of HIV transmission and of HIV transmission or death vs. the control. There was no difference in infant mortality alone. Compared with controls, the dual prophylaxis group had a lower risk of HIV transmission and of HIV transmission or death, but no difference in infant mortality alone. There was no difference in these outcomes between the two intervention arms. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally moderate to high. One trial compared six weeks of nevirapine with six months of nevirapine. Among infants of mothers not using highly active antiretroviral therapy, there was no difference in risk of HIV infection among the six month nevirapine group versus the six week nevirapine group. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally low to moderate. One trial compared a maternal triple-drug antiretroviral regimen, infant nevirapine, or neither intervention. Infants in the maternal prophylaxis arm were at lower risk for HIV, and HIV infection or death when compared with the control group. There was no difference in the risk of infant mortality alone. Infants with extended prophylaxis had a lower risk of HIV infection and of HIV infection or death versus the control group infants. There was no difference in the risk of infant mortality alone in the extended infant nevirapine group versus the control. There was no difference in HIV infection, infant mortality, and HIV infection or death between the maternal and extended infant prophylaxis groups. Evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally low to moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiretroviral prophylaxis, whether used by the HIV-infected mother or the HIV-exposed infant while breastfeeding, is efficacious in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Further research is needed regarding maternal resistance and response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy after maternal prophylaxis. An ongoing trial (IMPAACT 1077BF) compares the efficacy and safety of maternal triple antiretroviral prophylaxis versus daily infant nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission through breastfeeding.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^1153xcjy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral prophylaxis for infants when there is concern about future viremia during breastfeeding — despite current viral suppression — includes the following: When there is an interest in breastfeeding and current and recent HIV RNA levels are < 50 copies/mL, the Panels recommend extended infant ARV prophylaxis during breastfeeding with either NVP (nevirapine) or 3TC (lamivudine) and the addition of maternal adherence support. Lapses in adherence in the postpartum period are common, and data suggest that infant prophylaxis can be very effective; in the PROMISE trial, only 7 of the 1,211 (0.58%) analyzed infants in the infant NVP prophylaxis arm acquired HIV infection.

### Prevention of human immunodeficiency virus-1 transmission to the infant through breastfeeding: new developments [^114BvuRJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding accounts for up to half of all infant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections worldwide and carries an estimated transmission risk of about 15% when continued into the second year of life. Because replacement feeding is not safely available, culturally acceptable, or affordable in many parts of the world and because breastfeeding provides protection against other causes of infant mortality, approaches that reduce breastfeeding mother-to child transmission of HIV are being explored. These include exclusive breastfeeding for the infant's first few months of life followed by rapid weaning, treatments of expressed milk to inactivate the virus, and antiretroviral prophylaxis taken by the infant or mother during breastfeeding, which are strategies currently being tested in clinical trials. Passive (antibodies) and active (vaccine) immunoprophylaxis will also soon begin to be tested. This paper focuses on current and planned research on strategies to prevent breastfeeding transmission of HIV.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function

A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Breastfeeding infants with perinatal HIV exposure — testing frequency and timing: For infants with perinatal HIV exposure who are breastfeeding, virologic diagnostic testing is recommended at birth, 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months of age (AII), an additional virologic test should be performed if the gap between the tests at ages 1 to 2 months and 4 to 6 months is greater than 3 months, virologic diagnostic testing should be performed at least every 3 months during breastfeeding (BII), and after cessation of breastfeeding, virologic diagnostic testing should be performed at 4 to 6 weeks and 4 to 6 months after cessation (BII).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1111yp3r]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral management for infants with exposure to HIV during the breastfeeding period — Recommendations about extended ARV prophylaxis are based on the current and anticipated maternal virologic status during breastfeeding, with plans ideally made during the antepartum period and reassessment at delivery and regularly during breastfeeding (AIII). For infants at low risk of HIV acquisition during breastfeeding, some Panel members do not recommend extended ARV prophylaxis, whereas others recommend extended ARV prophylaxis with either nevirapine (NVP) or lamivudine (3TC) (CIII); infants are considered at low risk when maternal antiretroviral therapy is being taken while breastfeeding and sustained maternal virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) was achieved for at least 3 months prior to delivery and when the provider and patient are confident that maternal ART adherence will be maintained during breastfeeding (AIII). For infants currently at low risk but with concerns for future risk, the Panels recommend extended ARV prophylaxis with either NVP or 3TC (BIII), and adherence support should always be provided during breastfeeding (AIII). When used, extended ARV prophylaxis during breastfeeding should ensure continuous prophylaxis through the postnatal period; most experts recommend transitioning to NVP or 3TC after completing initial ZDV prophylaxis, although either NVP or 3TC can be given from birth to replace ZDV and provide both initial postnatal and extended prophylaxis during breastfeeding (BIII).

Lamivudine: Lamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 90, 600, and 4,000 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (at 90, 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day and at 15, 40, and 90 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 7 through 16 [rat] and 8 through 20 [rabbit]). No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations (Cmax) 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the fertility/pre- and postnatal development study in rats, lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180, 900, and 4,000 mg/kg/day (from prior to mating through postnatal Day 20). In the study, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, were not affected by the maternal administration of lamivudine.

Risk Summary

Abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of TRIUMEQ or its components on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production.

Potential risks of breastfeeding include: (1) HIV‑1 transmission (in HIV-1–negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-1–positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults.

Infant feeding — counseling, alternatives, and breastfeeding restriction: Women with HIV should receive evidence-based, patient-centered counseling to support shared decision-making about their desire for infant feeding, and replacement feeding with properly prepared formula or pasteurized donor human milk eliminates the risk of postnatal HIV transmission to the infant. Breastfeeding is not recommended for women who are not virally suppressed or for those who develop a detectable viral load while breastfeeding because of concern for increased risk of HIV.

Pregnancy Registry: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation: Instruct women with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Missed Dose: Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of abacavir tablets, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Availability of Medication Guide: Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting abacavir tablets and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed. Instruct patients to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens.

General Considerations for Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women and Women of Childbearing Potential

Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications for nPEP. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should have rapid access to nPEP when indicated. Because of the additional considerations regarding fetal and infant safety, expert consultation might be beneficial when nPEP is prescribed to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

A pregnancy test should be performed in women of childbearing potential at the initial evaluation for nPEP. For women who are pregnant, consider available pregnancy safety and outcome data, known adverse effects, and pharmacokinetic properties of ARVs. Risks for adverse effects of ARVs to pregnant women and their fetuses or infants must be weighed against the risks for maternal HIV acquisition and subsequent potential perinatal HIV transmission. The appendix "Safety and Toxicity of Individual Antiretroviral Agents in Pregnancy" of the HHS Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States might be useful for health care professional review and counseling of pregnant women. Pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy might lead to lower plasma levels of certain ARVs and might require increased doses or more frequent dosing (Tables 4 and 6). Drugs not recommended for use in pregnancy because of lack of available safety and pharmacokinetic data or possible inferior virologic efficacy include cobicistat-boosted atazanavir, darunavir, and elvitegravir. Health care professionals must recognize that safety data of ARV drugs in pregnancy might be incomplete. However, robust clinical experience with ART in pregnancy includes evidence-based national guidelines recommending ART for all women with HIV who are pregnant. Additional information about ARV use in pregnant women is available.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not recommended in children who weigh less than 40 kg because it is a fixed-dose tablet that cannot be adjusted for these patient populations [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)].

Therapy-Experienced Pediatric Trial

A randomized, double-blind trial, CNA3006, compared ZIAGEN®plus lamivudine and zidovudine versus lamivudine and zidovudine in pediatric subjects, most of whom were extensively pretreated with nucleoside analogue antiretroviral agents. Subjects in this trial had a limited response to abacavir.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

8.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function

Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min because abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of the lamivudine or zidovudine components of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is required for patients with renal impairment then the individual components should be used [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Clinical lactation studies during clinical development of a new drug if there is anticipated use by women of reproductive age

More than 80% of mothers in all settings breastfeed and the duration of (exclusive and nonexclusive) breastfeeding is reportedly highest in LMIC. Hence, understanding the extent of infant exposure to maternal drugs used for chronic or acute medical conditions is crucial to properly assess potential consequences: theoretical concerns for toxicity from high levels of exposure, prophylaxis with adequate exposure, or resistance development from subtherapeutic ARV exposure among infants who acquire HIV infection. Importantly, there is no need for extra preclinical data to justify a clinical lactation study. Existing ethics and regulatory frameworks support the conduct of PK studies in lactating women receiving a drug prescribed as part of standard clinical care. Examples exist of opportunistic PK studies that have significantly expanded our understanding of the clinical pharmacology of drugs used by lactating women. To further advance this field and obtain these data at earlier stages of drug development, the following recommendations are proposed:
Include phase I clinical lactation studies as part of phase III trials: Based on FDA guidance, breastfeeding will need to be temporarily interrupted (a woman may pump and discard her milk and feed her infant stored breastmilk) for the duration of the study to prevent infant exposure to an investigational drug. To get some insight into breastmilk transfer under this recommendation, milk could be pumped just after delivery (before the first breastfeeding session) in women who received the study drug during pregnancy in a phase III trial. An alternative approach is to include lactating women in phase III trials, in a setting where breastfeeding is recommended. Significantly, the FDA recommends noncompartmental and/or compartmental modeling approaches in the analysis of lactation PK data. PBPK modeling is especially promising to predict infant exposure where only breastmilk drug concentration data are available. An important consideration in using a PBPK approach in lactation studies is the availability of reliable drug and system parameters for both the maternal model and the "infant submodel" to adequately describe drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, including the milk‐to‐plasma ratio. Predictions from such models may serve as a basis for IRBs to evaluate the safety of prospective studies to evaluate infant exposure in a follow‐up clinical lactation study. PBPK models may also be a useful approach in evaluating potential changes in drug exposure during the pregnancy‐lactation transition period.
Encourage clinical lactation studies in LMIC: The contribution to infant health and the advice of breastfeeding in these countries compared with higher income countries presents an opportunity to impact public health and accelerate availability of lactation PK data. Reducing the time lag in new drug availability in these settings and making life‐saving medications available as soon as possible after approval will help build trust and facilitate early clinical lactation studies which can be conducted as opportunistic studies. Training and retraining of IRBs in LMIC will help facilitate these studies as the regulatory and ethical landscapes change. Endorsement statements of relevant agencies and organizations, including the WHO, FDA, and EMA, may help to get ethical approval and reach consensus on informed consent process, as the infant is a subject in the trial, with potentially a need for both maternal and paternal informed consent.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: a consensus statement [^116F9EmT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that women living with HIV are breastfeeding their infants, as is recommended in many low‐income and middle‐income countries (LMIC), it is important to know the extent of infant exposure to maternal drugs via breastmilk, in order to assess potential consequences. In general, low drug concentrations have been observed in breastmilk of women on ARVs; however, in theory, drug toxicity could occur in infants, for example due to long‐term exposure to low levels of ARVs. Prophylaxis to prevent infection, or a theoretical risk that resistance development from subtherapeutic exposure (e.g. to antimicrobial agents) in infants who acquire infection, can occur. In high‐income and some middle‐income countries, breastfeeding by women living with HIV is generally not recommended in order to reduce the likelihood of viral transmission to the infant. This prevents opportunistic design lactation studies when new drugs are first approved in these settings. In contrast, in LMIC, mothers living with HIV typically breastfeed for at least 12 months. Yet, ARV transfer into breastmilk and resulting infant ARV drug exposure from breastfeeding remains unknown for several ARVs.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^116nXDdm]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) in pregnant or breastfeeding women and women of childbearing potential is not contraindicated and should be rapidly accessible when indicated; because of fetal and infant safety considerations, expert consultation might be beneficial when prescribing. A pregnancy test should be performed in women of childbearing potential at the initial evaluation for nPEP. For women who are pregnant, consider available pregnancy safety and outcome data, known adverse effects, and pharmacokinetic properties of antiretrovirals (ARVs), and pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy might require increased doses or more frequent dosing. Drugs not recommended for use in pregnancy because of lack of available safety and pharmacokinetic data or possible inferior virologic efficacy include cobicistat-boosted atazanavir, darunavir, and elvitegravir. For breastfeeding, providing nPEP to women at substantial risk because of recent exposure reduces the risk for maternal HIV acquisition and possible subsequent transmission to the breastfeeding infant, and women should be counseled on the risk for HIV transmission through breastmilk should acute HIV infection occur. To eliminate any risk, HIV-exposed breastfeeding women might decide to stop breastfeeding, or they might choose other courses of action such as pumping and storing breastmilk until HIV infection is excluded and then resuming the previous breastfeeding routine. Health care professionals can access consultation for pregnant or breastfeeding patients by contacting the NCCC PEPline at 888–448–4911 or the Perinatal HIV Line at 888–448–8765.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^1162svR8]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Infant antiretroviral prophylaxis during breastfeeding — postnatal period: After initial postnatal prophylaxis, some Panel members recommend no additional prophylaxis when virologic suppression is maintained throughout breastfeeding, whereas other Panel members recommend extended ARV prophylaxis with NVP or 3TC during breastfeeding. Both NVP and 3TC have been used effectively for extended prophylaxis during breastfeeding; 3TC has been studied through 12 months of age and requires twice-daily administration, and NVP has been studied through 18 months of age and is given once daily. When extended prophylaxis is used, most experts recommend transitioning to NVP or lamivudine 3TC after completion of the initial ZDV prophylaxis; NVP can be given from birth, replacing ZDV and providing both initial postnatal prophylaxis and extended prophylaxis during breastfeeding. ZDV should not be used for a period of more than 6 weeks. Given the lack of consensus by the Panels, the Panels advise providers to involve the parent(s) in open discussion and shared decision-making, weighing values about risk tolerance and other issues related to infant prophylaxis.

### HIV transmission and 24-month survival in a randomized trial of HAART to prevent MTCT during pregnancy and breastfeeding in Botswana [^116Q17MZ]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

HAART for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) may impact long-term survival of women and children.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Methods

HIV-infected pregnant women with CD4+ cell count at least 200 cells/µl were randomly assigned to abacavir, zidovudine, lamivudine (arm A) or lopinavir–ritonavir, zidovudine–lamivudine (arm B) from week 26 to 34 gestation through planned weaning by 6 months postpartum. Women with baseline CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells/µl received nevirapine–zidovudine–lamivudine indefinitely (Obs arm), as did randomized women later qualifying for treatment.

Results

Among 560 randomized and 170 observational women enrolled, there were 14 deaths (1.9%) – one antenatally (Obs), three from delivery to 6 months postpartum (1 arm A, 2 Obs), and 10 from 6 to 24 months postpartum (5 arm A, 3 arm B, 2 Obs). Time to death or CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/µl was shorter in arm A vs. B (P = 0.03). Of the 709 live-born children, 97% breastfed for a median of 5.8 months. Of 37 (5.2%) deaths by 24 months, nine were before breastfeeding initiated (3 arm A, 2 arm B, 4 Obs); six while breastfeeding (1 arm A, 2 arm B, 3 Obs); and 22 after weaning (9 arm A, 11 arm B, 2 Obs). Only eight children (1.1%) were HIV-infected at 24 months (6 arm A, 1 arm B, 1 Obs), all before 6 months.

Conclusion

Low MTCT was maintained through extended follow-up in all arms. Disease progression appeared slower after discontinuing protease inhibitor-based HAART, but a concerning number of maternal deaths occurred after stopping either regimen. Strategies to improve maternal and child survival in the postintervention period are required.

### Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine (Trizivir) [^116sRPXJ]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Zidovudine: Reproduction studies with orally administered zidovudine in the rat and in the rabbit at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of teratogenicity with zidovudine. Zidovudine treatment resulted in embryo/fetal toxicity as evidenced by an increase in the incidence of fetal resorptions in rats given 150 or 450 mg/kg/day and rabbits given 500 mg/kg/day. The doses used in the teratology studies resulted in peak zidovudine plasma concentrations (after one half of the daily dose) in rats 66 to 226 times, and in rabbits 12 to 87 times, mean steady-state peak human plasma concentrations (after one sixth of the daily dose) achieved with the recommended daily dose (100 mg every 4 hours). In an additional teratology study in rats, a dose of 3,000 mg/kg/day (very near the oral median lethal dose in rats of approximately 3,700 mg/kg) caused marked maternal toxicity and an increase in the incidence of fetal malformations. This dose resulted in peak zidovudine plasma concentrations 350 times peak human plasma concentrations. No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in this experiment at doses of 600 mg/kg/day or less. Two rodent carcinogenicity studies were conducted [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry: To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to TRIZIVIR or other antiretroviral agents, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1–800–258–4263.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV infection.

Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Zidovudine: Lamivudine and zidovudine are excreted in human breast milk; abacavir and lamivudine are secreted into the milk of lactating rats.

Because of both the potential for HIV-1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving TRIZIVIR.

### Importance of prospective studies in pregnant and breastfeeding women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^114P9THN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In the past decade, the FDA and EMA have continued to emphasize the need for inclusion of women (pregnant and nonpregnant) in clinical development programs, issuing guidance for industry on how to conduct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in pregnant and lactating women, as well as on establishing pregnancy registries. There is still, however, a general lack of legislation or regulations that formally incentivize or mandate drug studies in pregnant women.

Despite efforts to promote postmarketing surveillance and investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of antiretroviral agents during pregnancy, data from these studies usually become available years after approval by stringent regulatory authorities (Figure 1). As a result, a substantial number of pregnant and breastfeeding women will inevitably use antiretroviral agents in the absence of any pregnancy-specific safety or pharmacokinetic data, putting both mother and infant at potential risk. Healthcare professionals are faced with the difficult balancing act of either accepting the potential risks of using newer antiretrovirals despite the absence of safety and pharmacokinetic data or denying pregnant and lactating women access to antiretrovirals that may offer significant benefits over older agents. Consequently, there is a need for information, gathered under rigorous scientific conditions, on antiretroviral pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety during pregnancy and lactation. Nevertheless, there are a number of important considerations when performing clinical studies in pregnant women. It is important that these are acknowledged and that existing knowledge gaps are addressed where possible.

### What will it take to achieve virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV? An assessment of current progress and future needs [^113uidDk]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2010). Low credibility.

In countries where breastfeeding is common, the probability of transmission from mother to child without any antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) is approximately 20–45%: approximately 15–25% transmission during pregnancy and 5–20% transmission during breastfeeding. In developed countries, where all four prongs are well implemented and the most effective ARVs are provided to HIV-positive pregnant women with limited breastfeeding, the level of MTCT has decreased to below 2%. National measures of MTCT rates are not available in most developing countries because health systems cannot directly measure HIV infections resulting from vertical transmission in a systematic way.

In November 2009 WHO released Rapid Advice: Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating Pregnant Women and Preventing HIV Infection in Infants and published revised full guidelines in July 2010. The new guidelines emphasise the importance of treating eligible HIV-positive pregnant women (CD4 ≤ 350) with lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) and recommend two equivalent options of highly effective prophylaxis to HIV-positive pregnant women who do not need ART for their own health. For the first time ARV prophylaxis to either the mother or child is also recommended during breastfeeding, in settings where breastfeeding is judged to be the safest infant feeding option. Option A starts treatment of women with zidovudine at 14 weeks of gestation or as soon as possible thereafter until delivery and the infant receives nevirapine throughout breastfeeding and until 1-week after exposure to breast milk has ended. Option B starts treatment of the mother with triple ARV prophylaxis from 14 weeks or as soon as possible thereafter and continues the maternal triple drug prophylaxis until 1-week after exposure to breast milk has ended. In 2010 WHO also released Guidelines on HIV and Infant Feeding, which recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, and continued breastfeeding and complementary foods from months 6 to 12, when either the mother or baby is receiving ARVs.

Harm signals and data gaps — recommendation posture for ARV in pregnancy: When strong evidence of harm to the fetus (or birthing parent) or unacceptable drug exposure exists, it is straightforward for the Panel to make recommendations against the use of a specific drug; however, this situation is unusual. More often, the Panel must make recommendations for ARV drugs for which there are insufficient PK data in pregnancy and/or inadequate safety information on fetal exposure early in pregnancy or during the periconception period. Policymakers, regulators, clinicians, and community advocates are striving to improve the availability of data on ARV drug exposure and safety during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, or in those who are of reproductive potential.

Infant safety with maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) versus infant nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis during breastfeeding — The rates of serious adverse events among infants who receive antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis during breastfeeding are low; in two studies comparing maternal ART to infant NVP prophylaxis, no significant differences in infant adverse events were observed between study arms. In the PROMISE study, week 26 mean lumbar spine bone mineral content was lower in infants in the maternal ART group than in the infant NVP group, with a difference about 0.23 g that was less than one-half standard deviation, considered unlikely to be clinically relevant, and no infant renal safety concerns were observed. An infant who acquires HIV while breastfeeding is at risk for developing ARV medication resistance due to subtherapeutic drug levels in breast milk, and a longitudinal retrospective study from the pre-ART era showed no statistically significant difference in the composition of the bacterial microbiome of breast milk between women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and those receiving no ARV medications during breastfeeding.

### Antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy and breast-feeding in Botswana [^113HiUZV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

The most effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in pregnancy and its efficacy during breast-feeding are unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned 560 HIV-1-infected pregnant women (CD4+ count, ≥ 200 cells per cubic millimeter) to receive coformulated abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine (the nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI] group) or lopinavir-ritonavir plus zidovudine-lamivudine (the protease-inhibitor group) from 26 to 34 weeks' gestation through planned weaning by 6 months post partum. A total of 170 women with CD4+ counts of less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter received nevirapine plus zidovudine-lamivudine (the observational group). Infants received single-dose nevirapine and 4 weeks of zidovudine.

Results

The rate of virologic suppression to less than 400 copies per milliliter was high and did not differ significantly among the three groups at delivery (96% in the NRTI group, 93% in the protease-inhibitor group, and 94% in the observational group) or throughout the breast-feeding period (92% in the NRTI group, 93% in the protease-inhibitor group, and 95% in the observational group). By 6 months of age, 8 of 709 live-born infants (1.1%) were infected (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5 to 2.2): 6 were infected in utero (4 in the NRTI group, 1 in the protease-inhibitor group, and 1 in the observational group), and 2 were infected during the breast-feeding period (in the NRTI group). Treatment-limiting adverse events occurred in 2% of women in the NRTI group, 2% of women in the protease-inhibitor group, and 11% of women in the observational group.

Conclusions

All regimens of HAART from pregnancy through 6 months post partum resulted in high rates of virologic suppression, with an overall rate of mother-to-child transmission of 1.1%. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00270296.)

Abstract

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency issued warnings on the use of dolutegravir and darunavir/cobicistat for treatment of pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It took 3–5 years to identify the risks associated with the use of these antiretroviral drugs, during which time pregnant women were exposed to these drugs in clinical care, outside of controlled clinical trial settings. Across all antiretroviral drugs, the interval between registration of new drugs and first data on pharmacokinetics and safety in pregnancy becoming available is around 6 years. In this viewpoint, we provide considerations for clinical pharmacology research to provide safe and effective treatment of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV and their children. These recommendations will lead to timelier availability of safety and pharmacokinetic information needed to develop safe treatment strategies for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, and are applicable to other chronic disease areas requiring medication during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding HIV transmission with maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) is described in case reports and the Mma Bana study, with detailed viral load measurements and timing. In one case, HIV RNA measured in the breast milk was 293 copies/mL at 1 month postpartum and < 37 copies/mL at months 3 and 6. In another, ART was started 14 weeks before delivery, maternal plasma RNA was < 37 copies/mL at 1 month and 3 months postpartum, and the infant tested positive for HIV at 3 months of age after testing negative at 1 month, with breast milk HIV RNA < 37 copies/mL at 1 month postpartum and 90 copies/mL at 3 months. The Mma Bana study compared triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (abacavir, ZDV, and lamivudine [3TC]) to protease inhibitor (PI)–based therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir plus ZDV and 3TC), reporting two lactational transmissions where maternal plasma and breast milk RNA were < 50 copies/mL at 1 and 3 months postpartum, both in the NRTI arm; in one case, ART was started 4 weeks before delivery and the infant tested positive for HIV at 94 days of life after testing negative at 28 days, and in another, ART was started 14 weeks before delivery with HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL at delivery and the infant tested positive at 91 days after testing negative at 21 days.

### Safety and efficacy of abacavir for treating infants, children, and adolescents living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Q9cLa]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor recommended in paediatric HIV care. We assessed the safety and efficacy profile of abacavir used in first, second, or subsequent lines of treatment for infants, children, and adolescents living with HIV to inform 2021 WHO paediatric ART recommendations.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included observational and experimental studies conducted in infants aged 0–1 year, children aged 1–10 years, and adolescents aged 10–19 years living with HIV; with data on safety or efficacy, or both, of abacavir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART); published in English or French between Jan 1, 2009, and Oct 1, 2020, plus an updated search to incorporate studies published between Oct 1, 2020, and May 15, 2022. Studies could be non-randomised or non-comparative and include patients who are treatment-naive or those who previously received abacavir (only if abacavir was combined with other ART). Case studies, studies in adults aged 18 years or older, and those assessing the effect of maternal ART exposure were excluded. We extracted data related to study identifier, study design, study period, setting, population characteristics, ART treatment, and safety (any hypersensitivity reaction, death, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, treatment discontinuation, any other morbidities, and serious adverse events), and efficacy outcomes (HIV viral load and CD4 counts reported at 6 and 12 months after ART initiation). Using random-effect models, we estimated weighted pooled incidence and relative risk (RR) of outcomes. The protocol is published in PROSPERO (CRD42022309230).

Findings

Of 1777 records identified, 1475 (83%) were screened after removing duplicates and a further 1421 (96%) were excluded. Of 54 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 33 (61%) were excluded. Four records were identified from grey literature plus one duplicate from database searching, resulting in 24 studies included (two randomised controlled trials, one single-arm trial, 12 prospective cohorts, seven retrospective cohorts, and two cross-sectional studies). 19 studies described safety data and 15 described efficacy data. 18 (75%) studies were conducted in ART-naive participants. The risk of bias was considered moderate to high for most studies, and all outcomes had significant between-study heterogeneity. Data from 24 265 participants were included, of whom 7236 (30%) received abacavir. Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction was reported in nine (38%) studies, with an incidence ranging from 0.00% to 8.26% (I² = 85%; p < 0.0001). The incidence of death (reported in seven studies) following abacavir treatment varied from 0.00% to 5.49% (I² = 58%; p = 0.026). Viral suppression (< 400 copies per mL) varied from 50% to 70% at 6 months (I² = 92%, p < 0.0001) and from 57% to 78% at 12 months (I² = 88%, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Toxic effects due to abacavir use remain rare and manageable. Despite scarce data on efficacy, this meta-analysis supports the use of abacavir as a preferred first-line regimen for infants and children living with HIV.

Funding

WHO.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^116uqZTW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral management of infants with HIV exposure during the breastfeeding period — extended prophylaxis planning and options — states that recommendations about extended ARV prophylaxis are based on the current and anticipated maternal virologic status during breastfeeding, and ideally, plans should be made during the antepartum period; reassessment should take place both at delivery and regularly during the breastfeeding period (AIII). For infants at low risk of HIV acquisition during breastfeeding, some Panel members do not recommend extended ARV prophylaxis; however, other Panel members recommend extended ARV prophylaxis with either nevirapine (NVP) or lamivudine (3TC) (CIII), and the Panels did not reach consensus. Infants are considered at low risk of transmission during breastfeeding when maternal antiretroviral therapy is being taken while breastfeeding and sustained maternal virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) was achieved for at least 3 months prior to delivery and when the provider and patient are confident that maternal ART adherence will be maintained during breastfeeding (AIII). For infants currently at low risk of HIV acquisition during breastfeeding but with concerns for future risk, the Panels recommend extended ARV prophylaxis with either NVP or 3TC (BIII), and adherence support should always be provided during breastfeeding (AIII). Extended ARV prophylaxis during breastfeeding, when used, should ensure continuous prophylaxis through the postnatal period; most experts recommend transitioning to NVP or 3TC after the completion of initial ZDV prophylaxis, although either NVP or 3TC can be given from birth, replacing ZDV and providing both initial postnatal prophylaxis and extended prophylaxis during breastfeeding (BIII).

Breastfeeding with HIV — infant antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and study limitations are described as follows: Infant ARV prophylaxis varied within and across study locations, including no ARV prophylaxis, zidovudine (ZDV) and/or nevirapine (NVP) for 4 to 6 weeks after birth, or continuing prophylaxis through one month after weaning, and some centers chose therapeutic dosing with three-drug ARV regimens for either the first 4 to 6 weeks after birth or through weaning. Although none of the studies identified cases of HIV transmission related to breastfeeding, the studies were not designed to evaluate transmission, the number of participating infants was small, follow-up has not been completed for all participants, some infants are still breastfeeding, a small number were lost to follow-up, and challenges during breastfeeding — including mastitis, inadequate milk supply with need for formula supplementation, episodes of detectable viral load, and difficulty weaning — require further study to inform optimal management.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^117DGZiQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Providing nPEP to women who are breastfeeding and are at substantial risk for HIV acquisition because of recent exposure reduces the risk for HIV acquisition and possible subsequent HIV transmission to the breastfeeding infant. Women who are breastfeeding should be counseled on the risk for HIV transmission through breastmilk should acute HIV infection occur. To eliminate any risk for HIV transmission to infants, HIV-exposed breastfeeding women might decide to stop breastfeeding. Other women who are breastfeeding might choose other courses of action (e.g. pumping and storing breastmilk until HIV infection is excluded, and then resuming the previous breastfeeding routine). Women who are breastfeeding also might be concerned about infant exposure to ARVs through breastmilk. The "Safety of Antiretroviral Drugs During Breastfeeding" portion of the "Infant Feeding for Individuals with HIV in the United States" section of the HHS Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States provides an overview of the varying penetration of different ARVs into breastmilk and is a useful resource to support counseling of women who are breastfeeding prescribed nPEP. Quality counseling supports shared decision-making regarding infant feeding during an nPEP course for a mother who is breastfeeding. Health care professionals with questions about medical decision-making or counseling for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding with nPEP indications can use local consultation resources or consult the NCCC PEPline at 888–448–4911 oror the Perinatal HIV Line at 888–448–8765 or.

Considerations related to pregnancy or breastfeeding — pregnant or breastfeeding women should be offered nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) when indicated, and because of added considerations for counseling and antiretroviral (ARV) prescribing during pregnancy or breastfeeding, expert consultation might be helpful, including consultation with local resources or the NCCC PEPline at 888–448–4911 or via the listed website; for women who are breastfeeding and exposed, evidence-based, patient-centered counseling should support shared decision-making about infant feeding and should include discussion of risks and benefits of continuing versus interrupting breastfeeding while taking nPEP and being monitored for HIV acquisition.

Furthermore, basic and clinical research exploring the mechanisms (ie, enzyme/transporter expression) of the pregnancy effect on maternal drug exposure, as well as the mechanisms behind transfer of drugs across the placenta and into breast milk, is needed to make physiologically based pharmacokinetic models of pregnancy more accurate and robust.

Although safety of antiretroviral therapy and pregnancy outcomes should be closely monitored during pharmacokinetic studies that include pregnant women, pharmacovigilance with postmarketing pregnancy surveillance studies, preferably global in scope, will still be necessary to delineate low-frequency adverse pregnancy outcomes. If all pregnancy outcomes of the first exposures to drugs during pregnancy are registered (> 1000 as an indication), safety signals may be picked up at an early stage after licensure, without delaying access to the new compounds for women of childbearing potential.

Inadequate drug exposure with the use of cobicistat-boosted drugs in pregnancy could have been recognized earlier if pregnancy pharmacokinetic studies had been performed at an earlier stage of drug development or if outcomes of initial pregnancies exposed after licensure had been registered. Regulatory requirements for obligatory studies in pregnancy should not delay the registration process or the availability of new drugs for women of childbearing potential, if these studies are routinely incorporated into the drug development process. Regulatory incentives may help successfully ease the transition to performance of initial pregnancy pharmacology studies as part of drug development and obligatory registration of pregnancy outcomes after licensure.

An approach based on the considerations outlined here and in the WHO toolkit for research and development of pediatric antiretroviral drugs and formulations will facilitate the timelier availability of safety and pharmacokinetic information needed to develop safe treatment strategies for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV. This approach is also applicable to other chronic disease areas where medication during pregnancy is required, such as diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and autoimmune diseases. Cross-sector efforts are needed to accelerate research and ensure that protecting women and their babies does not delay their access to universal health coverage.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: a consensus statement [^116maZXb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite these efforts, there are still several issues hindering the study of new ARV drugs in this population during the early phases of drug development (for example, nonuniformity in design and lack of standard methodology in conducting initial safety and PK studies in pregnant and lactating women). Legislation and regulations are in place to both incentivize and mandate trials in the pediatric population; however, these mandates are not in place for trials in pregnant women. A number of potential solutions have been identified to address the need for data in the absence of legislative requirements, but no consensus on standard procedures has been reached. For this reason, the International Maternal, Pediatric, Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network and the WHO‐convened Pediatric Antiretrovirals Working Group (PAWG) collaboratively organized a workshop in June 2019 to define key standards for generation of pharmacology data for ARVs to be used among pregnant and lactating women for HIV prevention and treatment. The IMPAACT/WHO workshop was designed to reach consensus on optimal methods for the design, analysis, and interpretation of pharmacology studies in PLWHIV and associated medical conditions. The objective of the meeting was to expand on existing principles outlined in the Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women module of the WHO "Toolkit for research and development of pediatric antiretroviral drugs and formulations"and reach a consensus on the optimal design and analysis of ARV pharmacology studies in PLWHIV, review the ARV product pipeline, including long‐acting and novel delivery platforms, identify key scientific gaps for use in LMIC, and identify immediate opportunities to undertake optimal studies and rapidly close the knowledge gaps.

Risk of HIV transmission to infants through breastfeeding — both the evidence regarding the risk of HIV transmission via breastfeeding and the strategies to reduce this type of transmission come from studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries, where rates of infant mortality are high and many families do not have access to safe water and affordable formula. Without maternal ART or infant ARV prophylaxis, the risk of an infant acquiring HIV through breastfeeding is 15% to 20% over 2 years, and the mechanisms of HIV transmission by breastfeeding are not fully understood.

### Performing drug safety research during pregnancy and lactation: biomedical HIV prevention research as a template [^117XAruq]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidance regarding use of nearly all pharmaceuticals by pregnant and lactating women is limited. Models for performing research may assist in filling these knowledge gaps. Internationally, reproductive age women are at high risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. Susceptibility to HIV infection may be increased during pregnancy, and risk of maternal-child transmission is increased with incident HIV infection during pregnancy and lactation. A multidisciplinary meeting of experts was convened at the United States National Institutes of Health to consider paradigms for drug research in pregnancy and lactation applicable to HIV prevention. This report summarizes the meeting proceedings and describes a framework for research on candidate HIV prevention agent use during pregnancy and lactation that may also have broader applications to other pharmaceutical products.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data of the three-drug regimens used for presumptive HIV therapy have provided reassuring evidence for its use in the neonatal period, and although the use of NVP to prevent HIV transmission has been found to be safe in neonates and newborns of low birthweight, these prophylaxis-dose regimens target trough drug levels that are at least tenfold lower than targeted therapeutic levels, whereas studies of treatment doses of NVP and RAL have established safe doses that achieve targeted PK parameters. At this time, the Panels do not recommend abacavir (ABC) as part of a presumptive HIV therapy regimen; however, in situations where ZDV is not available or the infant has ZDV-associated toxicity, ABC could be considered an alternative to ZDV.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^1164abbR]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral prophylaxis and presumptive HIV therapy in infants — All newborns exposed to HIV should receive appropriate antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as soon as possible, preferably within 6 hours after birth; providers should instruct caregivers on how to measure and administer ARV drugs correctly, provide access to medications after discharge, explain the importance of adherence, and suggest strategies for avoiding missed doses. Based on existing safety data, longitudinal laboratory monitoring for adverse events is not needed in otherwise healthy infants receiving currently recommended ARV drugs used for prophylaxis unless administration occurs beyond 6 weeks of life, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends periodic monitoring of hematologic and liver toxicity in breastfeeding infants receiving ARV prophylaxis with nevirapine (NVP) beyond this period and for extended durations.

### Herpes simplex virus and breastfeeding… [^11271WuU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Herpes simplex virus infections in infants can be severe. Mothers with HSV can continue to breastfeed if there are no lesions on the breasts, and if lesions elsewhere on the body are carefully and fully covered. Breastfeeding with active lesions Women with herpes lesions may transmit HSV to their infants by direct or indirect contact with the lesions. For mothers with active lesions, breastfeeding is acceptable if:

- No lesions are present on the breasts, and,
- Active lesions elsewhere on the mother are carefully and fully covered. Mothers with active lesions on the breast should. temporarily stop breastfeeding from the affected breast. She should not feed expressed breast milk from the affected breast. She should discard expressed breast milk from the affected side until the lesions have healed.

A mother may breastfeed her infant, or feed expressed breast milk, from the unaffected breast but should ensure that the lesions on the affected breast are completely covered to avoid transmission. Mothers should also follow appropriate hand hygiene to avoid transmission of herpes to her infant. While breast lesions are healing, some mothers may need additional support to maintain their milk production. Some mothers may feed their infant previously expressed milk or expressed milk from the unaffected breast. They could also supplement with infant formula. Mothers should consult with their health care provider to determine if their lesions have healed. A health care provider can help determine if the mother can resume breastfeeding or feeding expressed milk from the affected breast. Feeding hand-expressed or pumped breast milk It is not safe for a mother to give her infant hand-expressed or pumped breast milk from an affected breast if she has active herpes lesions on her breast.

Breast milk can be contaminated if it comes in contact with active herpes lesions by touching the breast during hand expression or via the pump. Expressing breast milk will be important for maintaining milk production while not breastfeeding from the affected breast. Mothers with herpes lesions should discard expressed breast milk from the affected breast until the lesions have healed. Mothers should be vigilant about practicing appropriate hand hygiene and cleaning the pump parts thoroughly. Mothers should talk with their health care provider to determine if their lesions have healed and if they can resume breastfeeding or feeding expressed milk from the affected breast.

### Safety and efficacy of abacavir for treating infants, children, and adolescents living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FggzC]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor recommended in paediatric HIV care. We assessed the safety and efficacy profile of abacavir used in first, second, or subsequent lines of treatment for infants, children, and adolescents living with HIV to inform 2021 WHO paediatric ART recommendations.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included observational and experimental studies conducted in infants aged 0–1 year, children aged 1–10 years, and adolescents aged 10–19 years living with HIV; with data on safety or efficacy, or both, of abacavir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART); published in English or French between Jan 1, 2009, and Oct 1, 2020, plus an updated search to incorporate studies published between Oct 1, 2020, and May 15, 2022. Studies could be non-randomised or non-comparative and include patients who are treatment-naive or those who previously received abacavir (only if abacavir was combined with other ART). Case studies, studies in adults aged 18 years or older, and those assessing the effect of maternal ART exposure were excluded. We extracted data related to study identifier, study design, study period, setting, population characteristics, ART treatment, and safety (any hypersensitivity reaction, death, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, treatment discontinuation, any other morbidities, and serious adverse events), and efficacy outcomes (HIV viral load and CD4 counts reported at 6 and 12 months after ART initiation). Using random-effect models, we estimated weighted pooled incidence and relative risk (RR) of outcomes. The protocol is published in PROSPERO (CRD42022309230).

Findings

Of 1777 records identified, 1475 (83%) were screened after removing duplicates and a further 1421 (96%) were excluded. Of 54 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 33 (61%) were excluded. Four records were identified from grey literature plus one duplicate from database searching, resulting in 24 studies included (two randomised controlled trials, one single-arm trial, 12 prospective cohorts, seven retrospective cohorts, and two cross-sectional studies). 19 studies described safety data and 15 described efficacy data. 18 (75%) studies were conducted in ART-naive participants. The risk of bias was considered moderate to high for most studies, and all outcomes had significant between-study heterogeneity. Data from 24265 participants were included, of whom 7236 (30%) received abacavir. Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction was reported in nine (38%) studies, with an incidence ranging from 0.00% to 8.26% (I² = 85%; p < 0.0001). The incidence of death (reported in seven studies) following abacavir treatment varied from 0.00% to 5.49% (I² = 58%; p = 0.026). Viral suppression (< 400 copies per mL) varied from 50% to 70% at 6 months (I² = 92%, p < 0.0001) and from 57% to 78% at 12 months (I² = 88%, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Toxic effects due to abacavir use remain rare and manageable. Despite scarce data on efficacy, this meta-analysis supports the use of abacavir as a preferred first-line regimen for infants and children living with HIV.

Breastfeeding and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis — Infant antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis varied within and across study locations, including no ARV prophylaxis, zidovudine (ZDV) and/or nevirapine (NVP) for 4 to 6 weeks after birth, or continuing prophylaxis through one month after weaning, and some centers chose therapeutic dosing with three-drug ARV regimens for either the first 4 to 6 weeks after birth or through weaning. Although none of the studies identified cases of HIV transmission related to breastfeeding, the studies were not designed to evaluate transmission, the number of participating infants was small, and follow-up has not been completed for all participants; some infants are still breastfeeding, and a small number were lost to follow-up. Clinicians who provide HIV care who have questions about infant feeding or are considering breastfeeding are encouraged to consult with an expert and/or the National Perinatal HIV/AIDS Hotline (1–888–448–8765).

Safety of antiretroviral drugs used for infant prophylaxis — When used alone for prophylaxis in low-risk scenarios during the neonatal period and breastfeeding, antiretrovirals (ARVs) appear highly safe, with the most prominent neonatal toxicity being anemia from zidovudine (ZDV) that occurs after 2–4 weeks and recovers with cessation of treatment. During breastfeeding, 3TC has been shown to be safe through at least 41 weeks of life, NVP has been shown to be safe for infants from birth through 18 months of life, and three-drug combinations appear safe within the durations currently recommended (i.e., 2–6 weeks).

Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Advise patients that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been reported with use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. Advise patients to stop taking abacavir if they develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any signs and symptoms of infection as inflammation from previous infection may occur soon after combination antiretroviral therapy, including when abacavir is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pregnancy Registry

Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Instruct women with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Missed Dose

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of abacavir, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Availability of Medication Guide

Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting abacavir and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed. Instruct patients to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV‑1–infected mothers in the U.S. not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV‑1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV‑1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ZIAGEN.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of ZIAGEN have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of ZIAGEN is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of ZIAGEN in adults and pediatric subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of ZIAGEN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of ZIAGEN in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function

A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, ZIAGEN is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### HIV and breastfeeding… [^116Msxxz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance HIV is a virus that attacks the body's immune system and is spread through certain body fluids, including breast milk. Transmission to the baby can occur during pregnancy or birth, or when breastfeeding. Antiretroviral therapy substantially reduces the risk of transmission to the baby. Mothers with HIV who want to breastfeed should receive patient-centered, evidence-based counseling on infant feeding options to allow for shared decision-making. Risk of transmission through breast milk For mothers on ART with a sustained undetectable HIV viral load during and after pregnancy, the risk of transmission through breastfeeding is less than 1%, but not zero. Recommendations Mothers with HIV who have questions about breastfeeding or who want to breastfeed need patient-centered, evidence-based counseling on infant feeding options to allow for shared decision-making.

Counseling should allow mothers and health care providers to work together to make infant feeding decisions. Begin counseling before becoming pregnant or as early as possible during pregnancy. Counseling on infant feeding should continue throughout the pregnancy and again after delivery. Reducing transmission through breast milk The risk of transmitting HIV through breast milk can be reduced by:

- Replacing breastfeeding with properly prepared formula or pasteurized donor human milk from a milk bank. This eliminates the risk of HIV transmission to the infant after birth.
- Achieving and maintaining viral suppression through ART during pregnancy, delivery, and after birth. This decreases risk of transmission through breastfeeding to less than 1%, but not zero. If mothers choose to breastfeed, providers should emphasize the importance of taking ART as directed and sustaining an undetectable HIV viral load. Providers should also address challenges to taking ART as directed after birth.

Follow-up care Mothers with HIV who choose to breastfeed should receive close follow-up care and be supported in minimizing the risk of HIV transmission to their infants. Health care providers can call the National Perinatal HIV/AIDS Hotline with questions about mothers with HIV who want to breastfeed. For comprehensive information, refer to Infant Feeding for Individuals With HIV in the United States. These recommendations are included within the Department of Health and Human Services Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States.
