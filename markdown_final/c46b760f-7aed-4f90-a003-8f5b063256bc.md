## Question

any meds for the tourniquet feeling caused as a residual of a thalamic stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications might help with a distressing "tourniquet feeling" after a thalamic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what this symptom represents diagnostically and whether it aligns with central post-stroke pain from a thalamic lesion. Then, I should verify the quality and limits of the evidence base for pharmacologic options. Next, I will consider pragmatic first-line and second-line medications, typical dosing and titration, and key safety screens. After that, I need to integrate non-pharmacological options, define a structured treatment trial with measurable outcomes, and plan monitoring for evolution or complications, all while keeping expectations realistic given the weak data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical interpretation: a constrictive "tourniquet" sensation after a thalamic stroke most plausibly reflects a dysesthetic form of central post-stroke pain (thalamic pain syndrome), typically arising from lesions impacting spinothalamic relays within ventrocaudal thalamus or anterior pulvinar that distort nociceptive processing despite no ongoing peripheral injury; hold on, I should verify the anatomic-risk signal for thalamic pain and yes, convergence on the anterior pulvinar and spinothalamic dysfunction correlate with thalamic pain, while VPL involvement alone does not, which fits the phenotype of tightness, pressure, or cramplike dysesthesia described after thalamic infarcts [^116q81rJ] [^113ad1jh] [^111bULLL].

> Next, I should review the strength of the evidence before I jump to drug choices; wait, the highest-credibility synthesis is a 2015 RCT systematic review showing that across eight trials (459 patients), anticonvulsants, an antidepressant, rTMS, acupuncture, and an opioid antagonist each had little to no effect on CPSP, so any recommendation must carry uncertainty and emphasize careful trials with modest expectations, while older narrative and disease-focused reviews suggest anticonvulsants and TCAs are commonly used despite low-quality support [^113MphAd] [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY].

> With that caveat, I will now examine pragmatic first-line pharmacologic options used in CPSP: gabapentin is frequently selected and supported by case-level data in CPSP and broader neuropathic pain practice, typically starting at 100–300 mg at night and titrating every few days to 900–1800 mg/day and sometimes up to 2400–3600 mg/day as tolerated and adjusted for renal function; lamotrigine has some supportive data but needs slow titration to mitigate rash risk, often starting at 25 mg/day and advancing gradually toward 200–400 mg/day; amitriptyline is commonly used at low bedtime doses (10–25 mg) with cautious titration to 50–75 mg/day and sometimes higher if tolerated, selected especially when sleep or mood symptoms coexist; pregabalin, while not robustly supported here, is often used by analogy to gabapentin with typical dosing 50–75 mg twice daily titrated to 150–300 mg twice daily if tolerated; I should double-check that these selections reflect the documents, and they do for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and amitriptyline, with pregabalin referenced indirectly in case-level context [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY] [^112TcPqC] [^1138DvmY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, should SNRIs like duloxetine or venlafaxine be listed as routine first-line here by extrapolation from peripheral neuropathic pain; initially I thought yes because they are standard for neuropathic pain, but hold on, I should verify the corpus, and the provided RCT synthesis does not support clear benefit and does not establish SNRIs in CPSP specifically, so if considered at all, they should be framed explicitly as off-label extrapolation with uncertain efficacy in CPSP within this evidence set rather than a core recommendation [^113MphAd].

> I need to ensure we address opioids carefully: tramadol or short, tightly supervised trials of opioids are sometimes considered for refractory cases, but the balance of risk includes tolerance, sedation, misuse, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia; I should confirm the safety messaging, including counseling on hyperalgesia and serotonin syndrome with serotonergic combinations, and yes, FDA labeling underscores both risks and the need for strict indications in opioid-tolerant patients only, so opioids should be a last resort, used short-term if at all, with close monitoring and clear exit criteria [^115HwFeY] [^115vz2Kp].

> Let me consider second-line and adjunctive options for partial or nonresponse: topical 5% lidocaine patches can be tried pragmatically for focal dysesthesia even though central mechanisms limit robust efficacy; intravenous lidocaine has demonstrated benefit in some central pain syndromes and can be used as an inpatient predictor for response to oral mexiletine where expertise exists; medical cannabis has only case-level support in CPSP after failures of amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, and opioids, so it may be considered only where legal and with informed consent regarding minimal evidence and psychoactive effects; I should verify that these are accurately reflected, and yes, IV lidocaine and general AED/TCA approaches appear in reviews, with the THC:CBD spray supported by a single case [^115HwFeY] [^1138DvmY].

> Before prescribing, I should confirm contraindications and interactions: for TCAs, screen for cardiac conduction disease, glaucoma, urinary retention, fall risk, and anticholinergic burden, and avoid serotonergic stacking; for gabapentinoids, adjust for renal function and monitor for sedation and edema; for lamotrigine, titrate slowly and avoid rapid escalation, with special caution if co-administered with valproate due to rash risk; for opioids and tramadol, screen for sleep apnea, constipation risk, misuse risk, and warn about hyperalgesia and serotonin syndrome symptoms if used with serotonergic agents; let me double-check the safety source for opioid counseling, which is supported by FDA labeling, and the AED/TCA cautions are consistent with the review context [^115vz2Kp] [^115HwFeY].

> I will now outline a structured treatment trial to avoid premature switching: choose a single agent matched to comorbidities and goals (for example, amitriptyline if insomnia and mood symptoms are prominent, gabapentin if anxiety and sleep disruption coexist), titrate slowly over 4–6 weeks toward a therapeutic range or until side effects limit further increases, and measure outcomes with a numeric rating scale specific to the "tourniquet" tightness and mapped sensory areas; if there is less than 30% improvement after 6–8 weeks at an adequate dose, switch drug class; if there is a partial response (30–50%), cautiously combine classes at lower doses; I need to ensure this trial-and-error approach aligns with evidence showing limited average effects and the need for individualized strategies, which it does [^113MphAd] [^113ad1jh] [^1174TuEt].

> Hold on, I should verify non-pharmacologic strategies early because medications often underperform: noninvasive rTMS can provide benefit but typically requires repeated sessions; for severe refractory CPSP, neuromodulation may be considered in expert centers, with motor cortex stimulation often favored over thalamic or brainstem DBS in older reviews, though success varies and durability can wane due to tolerance or impedance issues; directional thalamic DBS may help selected refractory CPSP cases, but benefits are variable and evidence remains case-level; I need to check that the balance of evidence emphasizes limited pharmacologic efficacy and a role for targeted neurostimulation, which it does [^113ad1jh] [^116Swazu] [^112PUbeV] [^115a5V8T] [^113ts3NB].

> To strengthen diagnostic confidence and track mechanisms, I should review the sensory profile formally when feasible; quantitative sensory testing data show complex relationships between sensory loss and allodynia in CPSP, and thalamic pain correlates with spinothalamic pathway dysfunction and anterior pulvinar involvement, supporting the central origin of symptoms and informing counseling that complete resolution is uncommon with drugs alone; let me confirm those mechanistic anchors, which are supported by lesion mapping and QST work [^115SMkp3] [^116q81rJ].

> I need to ensure ongoing monitoring for evolution and complications: schedule regular follow-up to reassess intensity, distribution, and evoked phenomena such as allodynia or hyperalgesia; be alert for rare evolution toward dystonic posturing such as "thalamic hand", where motor cortex stimulation has been reported to aid both dystonia and pain in refractory cases, while recognizing that neuromodulation benefits can diminish over time due to tolerance or hardware factors, necessitating reprogramming or alternative strategies [^113ts3NB] [^112PUbeV].

> Finally, let me reconsider the core message so expectations are realistic: the highest-quality evidence indicates that average effects of available therapies for CPSP are small, so we should emphasize safety, patient-centered goals, and incremental gains rather than cure; a rational sequence is to trial gabapentin, amitriptyline, or lamotrigine based on comorbidities and tolerability, escalate cautiously, consider combination therapy for partial responders, and integrate non-pharmacologic modalities early, reserving opioids for brief, carefully supervised rescue in selected refractory cases with robust risk mitigation [^113MphAd] [^113ad1jh].

Medications can alleviate the "tourniquet" sensation after thalamic stroke, but **relief is often partial and individualized** [^113MphAd]. First-line options include **amitriptyline or nortriptyline** and **gabapentin or pregabalin**; duloxetine or venlafaxine are alternatives if these are ineffective [^114yY7hj]. Second-line options include **lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine**, and **tramadol or tapentadol** for severe cases. If medications are inadequate, consider **rTMS, motor cortex stimulation, or deep brain stimulation** [^113ad1jh] [^116Swazu]. Combine pharmacotherapy with physical therapy and psychological support, and tailor treatment to response and side effects.

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological management of CPSP seeks to **modulate central pain pathways** and reduce neuronal hyperexcitability [^1174TuEt].

---

### Antidepressants

Among antidepressants, **tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** — amitriptyline and nortriptyline — are first-line for CPSP and modulate serotonin and norepinephrine pathways to reduce central pain perception [^114yY7hj] [^1174TuEt]. **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)** such as duloxetine and venlafaxine are alternatives, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate TCAs [^1174TuEt].

---

### Anticonvulsants

- **Gabapentin and pregabalin**: These medications are effective in reducing neuropathic pain by modulating calcium channels and reducing neuronal excitability [^114yY7hj] [^1174TuEt].

- **Lamotrigine**: Particularly useful in patients with allodynia, lamotrigine stabilizes neuronal membranes and reduces hyperexcitability [^115HwFeY].

- **Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine**: These sodium channel blockers are effective in some patients, particularly those with paroxysmal pain episodes [^1174TuEt].

---

### Opioids

For opioids, **tramadol and tapentadol** may be considered in severe cases, although their use is limited by potential side effects and dependency risks [^1174TuEt] [^115vz2Kp].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Given the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatments alone, **non-pharmacological interventions** are often recommended [^113MphAd]:

- **Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)**: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have shown promise in reducing CPSP symptoms [^113ad1jh].

- **Motor cortex stimulation (MCS)**: Invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as MCS, have demonstrated efficacy in refractory cases [^113ad1jh] [^116Swazu].

- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Although results are variable, DBS targeting the thalamus or periaqueductal gray may provide relief in selected patients [^113ad1jh] [^112PUbeV] [^115a5V8T].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend a **multidisciplinary approach**, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments [^1174TuEt]. Regular monitoring and therapy adjustments based on patient response and side effects are essential [^117KbRo3].

---

## Conclusion

Medications can alleviate the "tourniquet" sensation after thalamic stroke, but **relief is often partial and individualized** [^113MphAd]. **First-line options** include amitriptyline or nortriptyline and gabapentin or pregabalin; duloxetine or venlafaxine are alternatives if these are ineffective [^1174TuEt] [^114yY7hj]. **Second-line options** include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine, and tramadol or tapentadol for severe cases. **If medications are inadequate**, consider rTMS, motor cortex stimulation, or deep brain stimulation [^113ad1jh] [^116Swazu]. Combine pharmacotherapy with physical therapy and psychological support, and tailor treatment to response and side effects.

### Modulating the pain network — neurostimulation for central poststroke pain [^113ad1jh]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most under-recognized consequences of stroke, occurring in up to 10% of patients, and is also one of the most difficult to treat. The condition characteristically develops after selective lesions to the spinothalamic system, most often to the ventral posterior thalamus. Here, we suggest that CPSP is best characterized as a disorder of brain network reorganization, and that this characterization offers insight into the inadequacy of most pharmacological treatments.

Accordingly, we review the progress in the identification of nonpharmacological treatments, which could ultimately lead to mechanism-based therapeutics. Of the invasive neurostimulation treatments available, electrical motor cortex stimulation seems to be superior to deep brain stimulation of the thalamus or brainstem, but enthusiasm for clinical use of the procedure is limited by its invasiveness. The preference is for noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which, though effective, requires repeated application, causing logistical difficulties.

Although CPSP is often severe and remains difficult to treat, future characterization of the precise underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, together with technological innovation, should allow new treatments to evolve.

### Pharmacologic management part 2: Lesser-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114yY7hj]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This second part of a review of the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain diseases describes the treatment options for three lesser-studied neuropathic syndromes: central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome II. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients with these syndromes because the pain experienced is much greater and of a different type than would normally be expected following a stroke or injury to the spinal cord or a peripheral nerve. Even when an accurate and timely diagnosis is made, treatment options are limited and frequently suboptimal. However, the results of published trials do support the use of anticonvulsants and/or tricyclic antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy in these three neuropathic pain syndromes.

To maximize treatment outcomes, future research must:

- **Continue to elucidate** the relationship between the signs and symptoms of pain and the underlying pathophysiology.
- **Delineate the natural history** of central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome.
- **Identify patient-related factors** that may indicate an increased risk of developing neuropathic pain following stroke or nerve injury.
- **Investigate emerging treatments** that target underlying pain mechanisms.

### Evaluation and treatment of central pain syndromes [^115HwFeY]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Central pain syndromes represent a form of neuropathic pain that is associated with lesions of the brain or the spinal cord following a stroke or other traumatic injury. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) pain and central post-stroke pain (CPSP) are both classified as central pain syndromes, they may have differing etiologies. The pathophysiology of SCI pain and CPSP has yet to be completely elucidated, but both spinal and supraspinal pathways may be involved. Pain resulting from an injury to the CNS may be vague or difficult to classify or characterize, and patients may describe painful sensations that are poorly localized or change over time.

Pharmacologic interventions that have demonstrated efficacy in central pain syndromes include intravenous lidocaine and opioids, as well as the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) gabapentin and lamotrigine. Nonpharmacologic interventions have also demonstrated benefit in some patients who are refractory to pharmacologic treatments. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for central pain syndromes.

### Allodynia in patients with post-stroke central pain (CPSP) studied by statistical quantitative sensory testing within individuals [^115SMkp3]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

The disinhibition hypothesis of post-stroke central pain (CPSP) suggests that 'the excessive response (dysesthesia/hyperalgesia/allodynia) is accompanied by a loss of sensation' resulting from a lesion of a 'lateral nucleus' of thalamus or 'cortico-thalamic paths' [Brain 34 (1911) 102]. One recent elaboration of this hypothesis proposes a submodality-specific relationship, such that injury to a cool-signaling lateral thalamic pathway disinhibits a nociceptive medial thalamic pathway, thereby producing both burning, cold, ongoing pain and cold allodynia.

The study quantitatively evaluated sensory loss and abnormalities to discern submodality relationships between these sensory features of CPSP. The present results were statistically tested within individuals so that sensory loss and sensory abnormality are directly related by occurrence in the same individual. The results demonstrate that individuals with CPSP and normal tactile detection thresholds experience tactile allodynia significantly more often than those with tactile hypoesthesia. Most patients (11/13) exhibited hypoesthesia for the perception of cool stimuli, but few of these (2/11) showed cold allodynia. The most dramatic case of cold allodynia occurred in a patient who had a normal detection threshold for cold.

Individuals with cold hypoesthesia, strictly contralateral to the cerebro-vascular accident (CVA or stroke), were often characterized by the presence of burning, cold, ongoing pain, and by the absence, not the presence, of cold allodynia. Overall, these results in CPSP suggest…

### Tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1:1 ratio: a therapeutic option for patients with central post-stroke pain syndrome [^1138DvmY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Central pain after stroke due to brainstem infarction is very rare, and treatment is difficult as specific guidelines are lacking. This is the report of a 61-year-old female patient who, following a posterolateral left medulla oblongata insult with incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, developed burning and tingling pain in the contralateral leg and burning and shooting pain in the ipsilateral face in trigeminal branches 1 and 2. More than three years of therapy with amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, and various grade II and III opioids was ineffective or showed intolerable side effects. The administration of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1:1 ratio improved the pain situation and quality of life quickly and permanently. The encouraging results in the present case may suggest that treatment with medical cannabis should be considered in similar cases when standard therapies are insufficient.

### Deep brain stimulation for movement disorders after stroke: A systematic review of the literature [^113H1qo8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Low credibility.

Stroke remains the leading cause of disability in the United States. Despite advancements in acute care for strokes, options for improving function in the subacute and chronic stages remain limited. Identification of new therapeutic approaches is critical. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) holds promise for these patients. Numerous case reports and small case series have reported improvement in movement disorders after strokes in patients treated with DBS. In this systematic review, the authors have summarized the patient characteristics, anatomical targets, stimulation parameters, and outcomes of patients who have undergone DBS treatment for poststroke movement disorders.

- **Methods**: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The PubMed, Scopus, and SpringerLink databases were searched for the keywords "DBS", "stroke", "movement", and "recovery" to identify patients treated with DBS for movement disorders following a stroke. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklists for case reports and case series were used to systematically analyze the quality of the included studies. Data collected from each study included patient demographic characteristics, stroke diagnosis, movement disorder, DBS target, stimulation parameters, complications, and outcomes.

- **Results**: The authors included 29 studies that described 53 patients who underwent placement of 82 total electrodes. Movement disorders included tremor (n = 18), dystonia (n = 18), hemiballism (n = 6), and spastic hemiparesis (n = 1).

### Actiq [^115vz2Kp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and advise them to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Drug Interactions (7)].

- **MAOI interaction**: Inform patients to avoid taking Actiq while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start taking MAOIs while using Actiq [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Important administration instructions**: Instruct patients not to take Actiq for acute pain, postoperative pain, pain from injuries, headache, migraine, or any other short-term pain, even if they have taken other opioid analgesics for these conditions. Instruct patients on the meaning of opioid tolerance and that Actiq is only to be used as a supplemental pain medication for patients with pain requiring around-the-clock opioids who have developed tolerance to the opioid medication.

### Intracortical inhibition is reduced in a patient with a lesion in the posterolateral thalamus [^111w73hK]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a patient who developed a complex movement disorder following an ischemic lesion in the right posterolateral thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation showed a shortening of the cortical silent period and deficient cortico-cortical inhibition using paired magnetic pulses on the affected side, indicating reduced effectiveness of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms.

### Identifying therapeutic targets from spontaneous beneficial brain lesions [^113sNMAP]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Brain damage can occasionally result in paradoxical functional benefit, which could help identify therapeutic targets for neuromodulation. However, these beneficial lesions are rare, and lesions in multiple different brain locations can improve the same symptom. Using a technique called lesion network mapping, we show that heterogeneous lesion locations resulting in tremor relief are all connected to common nodes in the cerebellum and thalamus, the latter of which is a proven deep brain stimulation target for tremor. These results suggest that lesion network mapping can identify the common substrate underlying therapeutic lesions and effective therapeutic targets.

### Directional sensory thalamus deep brain stimulation in poststroke refractory pain [^115a5V8T]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for chronic pain is performed in selected patients with a variable success rate. We report the use of recently developed directional DBS in a patient with hemibody central poststroke pain (CPSP) and its added value in the induction of pleasant, pain-distracting paresthesias throughout the contralateral body side. A 68-year-old man suffered from multiple strokes in the left hemisphere 11 years before presentation, resulting in medically refractory right-sided hemibody CPSP. He was implanted with a directional DBS electrode in the left ventrocaudal nucleus of the thalamus. A directional single-segment contact configuration produced a better improvement throughout the contralateral body side than ring-mode and other directional configurations. Treatment led to a reduction of almost 50% in pain. This case demonstrates the value of directional DBS in the treatment of chronic pain, as steering increases selectivity and reduces side effects in a small target area surrounded by structures with high functional diversity.

### Thalamic volume loss is greater in children than in adults following middle cerebral artery territory arterial ischemic stroke [^114b2keS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Younger stroke patients may suffer worse outcomes than older patients; however, the extent to which age at stroke impacts remote areas of the brain remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine thalamic volume changes ipsilateral to middle cerebral artery territory strokes based on age at acute ischemic stroke onset.

- **Methods**: Acute ischemic stroke patients 18 years old were retrospectively recruited from a large quaternary care system. Each subject underwent an acute (90 days) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Manual thalamic segmentation was performed.

- **Results**: Younger and older children had significantly greater stroke-side thalamic volume loss compared to adults (48.2%, P = 0.022; 40.7%, P = 0.044, respectively). Stroke-side thalamic volumes decreased across the age spectrum, but to a greater degree in pediatric patients.

This observation can affect functional and cognitive outcomes post-stroke and warrants further research.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^114GZo3K]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Thalamic strokes produce neurological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms depending on the thalamic nuclei involved. Traditionally associated with severe cognitive deficits, recent studies suggest more modest impairments. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the severity of cognitive impairment following thalamic stroke.

- **Methods**: We recruited 40 patients (mean age 51.1) with chronic isolated thalamic stroke and 45 healthy subjects (mean age 48.5) who underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to discriminate patients from healthy subjects based on cognitive tasks. Disconnectome maps and cortical thickness were analyzed to understand the distant impact of thalamic strokes.

- **Results**: Two cognitive profiles emerged from the cluster analysis. Cluster 1 included mostly healthy subjects (n = 43) and patients with no or minor deficits (n = 20), while Cluster 2 included patients (n = 19) and two healthy subjects with severe deficits in verbal memory, executive functions, and attention. Cluster 1 encompassed all patients with right thalamic stroke, whereas Cluster 2 included all patients with bilateral stroke or mammillothalamic tract interruption. Patients with left-sided stroke were equally divided between clusters. Significant differences between clusters included age, education, interthalamic adhesion disruption, lesion volume, and location. Patients with left-sided stroke in Cluster 2 had more lateral thalamic lesions and greater disruption of the anterior thalamic projection.

### Frequency, clinical presentation and outcome of vigilance impairment in patients with uni- and bilateral ischemic infarction of the paramedian thalamus [^114AtoV8]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Ischemic stroke of the paramedian thalamus is a rare differential diagnosis in sudden altered vigilance states. While efforts to describe clinical symptomatology exist, data on the frequency of paramedian thalamic stroke as a cause of sudden impaired vigilance and on accompanying clinical signs and outcomes are scarce. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary stroke center between 2010 and 2019 who were diagnosed with paramedian thalamic stroke. We evaluated the frequency of vigilance impairment (VI) due to paramedian thalamic stroke, accompanying clinical signs, and short-term outcomes in uni- versus bilateral paramedian lesion locations.

Out of 3896 ischemic stroke patients, 53 showed a paramedian thalamic stroke location (1.4%). VI was seen in 29 out of 53 patients with paramedian thalamic stroke and in 414 out of 3896 with any stroke (10.6%). Paramedian thalamic stroke was identified as causal to VI in 3.4% of all patients with initial VI in the emergency department and in 0.7% of all ischemic stroke patients treated in our center. Accompanying clinical signs were detected in 21 of these 29 patients (72.4%) and facilitated a timely diagnosis. VI was significantly more common after bilateral than unilateral lesions (92.0% vs. 21.4%; p < 0.001). Patients with bilateral paramedian lesions were more severely affected, had longer hospital stays, and more frequently required in-patient rehabilitation. Paramedian thalamic lesions account for about 1 in 15 stroke patients presenting with impaired vigilance. Bilateral paramedian lesion location is associated with worse stroke severity.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^113iysru]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The demographical and clinical data of the included patients, together with the control stroke patients, is presented in Table 1. Five of the nine patients with stroke lesions involving the thalamus and severe impairment of arousal experienced reversible coma or stupor. This condition resolved after mechanical thrombectomy, indicating that the severe impairment of arousal was not caused by their residual stroke lesions. Four patients experienced long-term coma or stupor; one of these patients had received thrombolysis, and another had received both thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Notably, three out of four patients with long-term coma or stupor, three out of five patients with transient coma or stupor, and 231 out of 500 control patients also had prior strokes.

- **Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients**: All four thalamic lesions causing long-term severe impairment of arousal extended into the brainstem, as illustrated in Figure 1A, B. All nine cases of long-term or reversible severe impairment of arousal were associated with posterior circulation strokes (Figure 1B, C). The overlap of the four lesions causing long-term severe impairment of arousal, shown in Figure 1B, included a small region in the brainstem that was not affected by any lesions in the control datasets (Figure 1C, D). This suggests a potential causal relationship between these regions and impairment of consciousness (Figure 1E). These regions intersected several brainstem structures, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and their surrounding white matter tracts (Figure 1E).

### Role of neurorehabilitation in the recovery of bilateral thalamic stroke related to the artery of Percheron anatomical variant [^114X8tw8]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Bilateral thalamic stroke is a rare condition, primarily associated with the artery of Percheron (AoP) variant. The clinical presentation of AoP-related strokes is highly variable and often includes cognitive and behavioral alterations. This report describes the clinical progression of an AoP-related bilateral thalamic stroke and underscores the significant role that a tailored rehabilitation program plays in facilitating recovery.

A man in his 40s was admitted to the neurology ward due to a sudden onset of mental status changes and weakness in his left limbs. Initial brain CT and subsequent MRI revealed a bilateral thalamic stroke with the presence of an AoP anatomical variant. After the initial critical phase, the patient's condition stabilized, yet he continued to experience severe deficits in attention, memory, and speech. The patient was then transferred to a rehabilitation unit where he underwent a customized neurorehabilitation program, leading to a full recovery of symptoms. Neurorehabilitation is crucial for patient recovery and should always be employed to minimize residual deficits and, more importantly, to prevent permanent cognitive impairments.

### Optogenetic rewiring of thalamocortical circuits to restore function in the stroke injured brain [^111grGD4]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

To regain sensory and motor function after stroke, surviving neural circuits must reorganize and make new connections. Therapies that promote better neural rewiring ultimately result in better functional outcomes. Thus far, most research has focused on understanding and manipulating cortical circuits to improve recovery from ischaemic stroke. This focus is partly born out of the fact that evoked cortical activity in the damaged hemisphere is depressed for many weeks after focal stroke when sensorimotor deficits are most pronounced. However, sensory-evoked cortical activity is dependent on the integrity of afferent inputs from the thalamus. Despite this crucial role, it has long been overlooked as a possible substrate for mediating stroke recovery. This is somewhat surprising given that the structure and function of thalamocortical circuits can be modified well into adult life, thereby raising the possibility that these connections could be targeted and manipulated by a stroke therapy to help restore lost functions.

Of the few studies that have examined thalamic circuits, it has been shown that focal ischaemia attenuates neural excitability in thalamic nuclei and leads to scattered cell death and gliosis. The paucity of data on this subject leaves many important questions unanswered. For example, how does stroke impact sensory-driven response properties within thalamocortical axons? To what extent are thalamocortical axons capable of sprouting new branches after stroke or remodelling synaptic contacts on existing branches?

Lastly, if thalamocortical connections are damaged…

### Subjective cognitive-affective status following thalamic stroke [^114WXAft]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Previous patient studies suggest that thalamic stroke may yield persistent deficits in several cognitive domains. At present, the subjective dimension and everyday relevance of these impairments are unclear, since many patients with thalamic stroke only show minor changes on physical examination. Here, we have studied the subjective consequences of focal thalamic lesions. A sample of 68 patients with a history of ischemic thalamic stroke was examined using established clinical self-report questionnaires assessing memory, attention, executive functions, emotional status, and health-related quality of life. To control for general factors related to cerebrovascular disease, self-reports were compared to an age-matched group of 34 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack.

Thalamic lesions were co-registered to an atlas of the human thalamus. Lesion overlap and subtraction analyses were used for lesion-to-symptom mapping. When both patient groups were compared, no significant differences were found for any questionnaire. However, when subgroups were compared, patients with infarctions involving the posterior thalamus showed significant emotional disturbances and elevated anxiety levels compared to patients with more anterior lesions. Our findings thus point to the existence of a persistent affective impairment associated with chronic lesions of the posterior thalamus. This syndrome may result from damage to connections between the medial pulvinar and extra-thalamic regions involved in affective processing. Our findings suggest that the posterior thalamus may continue to play a role in emotional and cognitive functions following a thalamic stroke.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^1138rwFB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but they tend to shorten over time. This condition can impair daily activities and lead to depression.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review addressing the clinical question: What are the effects of ongoing treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen, carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, microvascular decompression, and destructive neurosurgical techniques, including radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery.

### Thalamic pain: Anatomical and physiological indices of prediction [^116q81rJ]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Thalamic pain is a severe and treatment-resistant type of central pain that may develop following a thalamic stroke. Lesions within the ventrocaudal regions of the thalamus carry the highest risk of developing pain, but its emergence in individual patients remains impossible to predict. Because damage to the spino-thalamo-cortical system is a crucial factor in the development of central pain, in this study, we combined detailed anatomical atlas-based mapping of thalamic lesions with assessment of spinothalamic integrity using quantitative sensory analysis and laser-evoked potentials in 42 thalamic stroke patients, of whom 31 had developed thalamic pain.

More than 97% of lesions involved an area between 2 and 7 mm above the anterior-posterior commissural plane. Although most thalamic lesions affected several nuclei, patients with central pain showed maximal lesion convergence on the anterior pulvinar nucleus (a major spinothalamic target), while the convergence area lay within the ventral posterior lateral nucleus in pain-free patients. Both involvement of the anterior pulvinar nucleus and spinothalamic dysfunction (nociceptive thresholds, laser-evoked potentials) were significantly associated with the development of thalamic pain, whereas involvement of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus and lemniscal dysfunction (position sense, graphaesthesia, pallaesthesia, stereognosis, standard somatosensory potentials) were similarly distributed in patients with or without pain.

A logistic regression model combining spinothalamic dysfunction and anterior pulvinar nucleus involvement served as regressors.

### Thalamic warning syndrome and the artery of Percheron [^1171qQUj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Stroke warning syndromes manifest as brief, recurring episodes of focal neurological deficits that precede definitive brain ischaemia. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, intermittent hypoperfusion in specific vascular territories may explain these phenomena. A man in his 60s with vascular risk factors experienced episodes of sudden loss of consciousness. Initial imaging and tests were normal, excluding other potential causes. MRI revealed bilateral thalamic infarction and the presence of an artery of the Percheron variant. We propose 'thalamic warning syndrome' as a new term for this clinical presentation, characterized by transient loss of consciousness and a high risk of subsequent thalamic infarction. Early recognition of this syndrome can aid in the initial management and prognosis of similar cases, potentially preventing more severe neurological impairments.

### Permanent reversal of essential tremor following a frontal lobe stroke [^114VxbSz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Following a right prerolandic stroke, a 76-year-old woman with bilateral upper extremity essential tremor (ET) experienced permanent recovery from the tremor contralaterally to the affected hemisphere. The ischemic stroke likely disrupted the cortical component of the ET network. Due to the significant neuronal loss, post-stroke cortical reorganization was unable to restore this crucial component of the ET network, leading to the permanent suppression of ET.

### Thalamic cramplike pain [^111bULLL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a case of cramplike pain following a left thalamic ischemic stroke, a neglected type of central post-stroke pain, and its neuroanatomical correlates.

- **Observations**: A 68-year-old right-handed man presented with right arm, leg, and flank cramplike pain noted upon awakening. Neurological examination was normal, with no evidence of objective sensory abnormalities. Initially, due to the nature of the pain and preserved sensory function, stroke was not considered a potential cause. The pain was suspected to be related to the combined effect of intense physical exercising on the right side and the use of statins. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute ischemic infarction within the left thalamus. By registering high-resolution 3 T T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to the Talairach atlas, it was shown that the infarction is within the border between the pulvinar and the ventral posterior medial nuclei. Brodmann's areas 3, 1, 2, 4, and 6 were identified as the cortical correlates of the ischemic lesion by diffusion tensor tractography.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Thalamic cramplike pain should be recognized as a type of central post-stroke pain, probably produced by lesions localized to the border between the ventral posterior and pulvinar nuclei and connected to the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex and primary and secondary motor cortices.

### Hemidystonia secondary to thalamic hemorrhage treated with GPi stimulation [^116LjciD]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

There have been few reports on the surgical treatment of secondary hemidystonias, most of which are due to basal ganglia stroke or trauma. We present two patients with hemidystonia secondary to thalamic hemorrhage whom we successfully treated with unilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation.

- **Case 1**: A 56-year-old man experienced abnormal posturing and intolerable muscle contraction pain in the left arm.
- **Case 2**: A 73-year-old woman developed severe abnormal posturing in the right arm and gait disturbance due to hyperextension of the right leg. The dystonic symptoms of both patients were refractory to medication.

Three months after the inception of high frequency GPi stimulation, the motor scores on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale improved by 49.2% and 34.3% in Cases 1 and 2, respectively. We suggest GPi stimulation as a possible alternative to treat secondary hemidystonia.

### Feeling sounds following a thalamic lesion [^115fiJ3T]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VL), based on its connectivity with the cerebellum and motor cortex, has long been considered to be involved with motor functions. We show that the human VL also plays a prominent role in sensory processing.

- **Methods**: Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were used to localize a small lesion restricted to the right VL in a patient with contralesional sensory processing deficits. Systematic assessments of anatomic brain organization and behavioral measurements of somatosensory and visual processing were conducted at several time points after stroke.

- **Results**: Initially, the patient was more likely to detect events on the contralesional side when a simultaneous ipsilesional event was presented within the same, but not different, sensory modality. This perceptual phenomenon, which we refer to as unisensory antiextinction, persisted for several months before transforming into a form of synesthesia in which auditory stimuli produced tactile percepts. Tractography performed on the diffusion tensor imaging data showed altered connections from the lesioned thalamus to the cerebral cortex, suggesting a neural basis for these sensory changes.

- **Interpretation**: These results demonstrate a role for the VL in sensory processing and suggest that reorganization of thalamocortical axonal connectivity can lead to major changes in perception.

### Systematic review of central post stroke pain: What is happening in the central nervous system [^117Vbo5i]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most common central neuropathic pain syndromes seen after stroke. It is mainly related to vascular damage at certain brain territories and the pain corresponding to specific body areas. In the past, it was described as one of the definitive symptoms of thalamic lesions. However, recent findings suggest that it occurs not only after thalamic lesions but also following vascular lesions in any part of the central nervous system.

Although there are certain hypotheses to explain the physiopathologic mechanisms of CPSP, further evidence is needed. The majority of cases are intractable and unresponsive to analgesic treatment. Electrical stimulation methods, such as deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, seem effective in certain cases.

In this systematic review, recent advancements related to CPSP mechanisms have been evaluated. Further investigations are needed to unravel the mystery of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CPSP.

### Neuropsychiatric manifestation following a stroke: Newly developed symptoms or side-effect of drug [^117B4eqn]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old woman presented with the sudden onset of left-sided body weakness and numbness, diagnosed as multifocal cerebral infarct with right thalamic bleed. She had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient suffered from central post-stroke pain and reactive depression as post-stroke complications, for which amitriptyline was prescribed. Unfortunately, she developed symptoms suggestive of mania and psychosis upon initiation of the medication, which resolved upon withdrawal of amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of post-stroke pain and is particularly useful in cases of concomitant depression. Unexpectedly, this patient developed new psychopathologies after the initiation of this medication.

This case highlights the development of new psychopathologies that could be due to the antidepressant, underlying bipolar disorder, or a complication of the stroke itself. Primary care providers need to actively inquire about neuropsychiatric symptoms, as they can adversely affect the patient's quality of life and impede rehabilitation efforts.

### Intracranial neurostimulation for pain control: A review [^116Swazu]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Intracranial neurostimulation for pain relief is most frequently delivered by stimulating the motor cortex, the sensory thalamus, or the periaqueductal and periventricular gray matter. Stimulation through motor cortex stimulation (MCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven effective for treating numerous neuropathic and nociceptive pain states that are not responsive or amenable to other therapies or types of neurostimulation. Prospective randomized clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of these intracranial therapies have not been published.

Intracranial neurostimulation is somewhat different from other forms of neurostimulation in that its primary application is for the treatment of medically intractable movement disorders. However, the increasing use of intracranial neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain, especially for pain not responsive to other neuromodulation techniques, reflects the efficacy and relative safety of these procedures. First employed in 1954, intracranial neurostimulation represents one of the earliest uses of neurostimulation to treat chronic pain that is refractory to medical therapy.

Currently, two kinds of intracranial neurostimulation are commonly used to control pain: motor cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation. MCS has shown particular promise in treating trigeminal neuropathic pain and central pain syndromes such as thalamic pain syndrome. DBS may be employed for various nociceptive and neuropathic pain states, including cluster headaches and chronic low back pain.

### Central post-stroke pain syndrome: yet another use for gabapentin [^112TcPqC]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Although gabapentin was originally developed for treating partial seizures, it has been used mainly to treat various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. However, there is very limited experience with gabapentin for the treatment of pain conditions of the central nervous system, such as central post-stroke pain syndrome. We report the case of a 45-year-old man with central post-stroke pain syndrome who failed to respond to a variety of oral analgesics. Within two weeks of the inception of gabapentin therapy, his average pain was significantly reduced, and his level of function improved. We conclude that gabapentin may be an effective medication for the treatment of central post-stroke pain syndrome.

### Analgesia in conjunction with normalisation of thermal sensation following deep brain stimulation for central post-stroke pain [^112PUbeV]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Although these findings are encouraging, the analgesic benefits of DBS for ML were relatively short-lived due to increased electrode impedance, possibly secondary to local gliosis, which limited the effectiveness of stimulation. It is also possible that ML developed stimulation tolerance, as has been observed with DBS for other chronic pain conditions. The limited evidence base supporting the use of DBS in CPSP has led the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) to advise that indications for DBS in CPSP are 'equivocal' and that further comparative trials are necessary, a recommendation that we fully endorse.

In conclusion, we report a case of refractory CPSP due to a large temporo-parietal infarct that was improved by DBS of the PVG. This improvement was associated with a normalisation of hemi-body sensory inattention. Although we cannot prove causation, we speculate that the beneficial action of DBS of the PVG in this case is via the restoration of normal sensory transmission of innocuous exteroceptive stimuli to higher centers, perhaps by an action on the thalamus. This holds out the promise that even in the case of extensive CNS damage, the pain-generating mechanisms may be amenable to neuromodulatory approaches such as DBS.

### Vaginal allodynia as the presentation of a thalamic tumor [^111q87kh]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Central pain syndromes associated with damage to the thalamic sensory relay nuclei have been predominantly described in the stroke literature; however, pain syndromes linked to thalamic neoplasms are much less common. We describe a woman with dyspareunia secondary to vaginal allodynia as the presenting sign of a left thalamic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. Subsequent to an uneventful stereotactic biopsy, her vaginal allodynia progressed to hemi-body allodynia. We believe this is the first reported case of isolated vaginal allodynia associated with a thalamic neoplasm or any other structural pathology of the central nervous system.

Dyspareunia secondary to vaginal allodynia as the presenting sign of a left thalamic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma is reported in a rare case, underscoring that thalamic pathology, including neoplasms, should be considered when evaluating patients with longstanding and unexplained pain syndromes.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^112hYuS7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The brainstem is the posterior portion of the brain that remains continuous with the spinal cord. It is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. These subdivisions are responsible for cranial nerve III–XII activity, nerve conduction via ascending and descending pathways, and integrative functions including vasomotor control, breathing, swallowing, sleeping, and maintaining consciousness. Strokes within the brainstem can impair any of these functions. Depending on the size and location of the lesion, patients can present with mild symptoms to profound, life-threatening deficits. This underscores the importance of having a basic understanding of the brainstem's anatomical structures along with the ability to perform a thorough history and neurological examination. Clinical recognition and localization of the lesion can help expedite an accurate diagnosis with early treatment initiation.

In general, brainstem strokes will have more sensory deficits if the lesion is localized posteriorly and more motor deficits if the lesion is localized anteriorly. On review of the literature, the main mechanism of brainstem infarcts presenting with predominant early-onset paraesthesia strongly suggests involvement of the medial lemniscus tract in the paramedian posterior pontine region. While thalamic lesions are the most common cause of pure sensory stroke (PSS), pure lemniscal sensory deficits associated with the thalamus are uncommon. Thalamic lesions typically have additional involvement of the spinothalamic tract due to the wide projection of spinothalamic fibers to numerous thalamic nuclei.

### Management of central poststroke pain: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113MphAd]. Stroke (2015). High credibility.

Central poststroke pain is a chronic neuropathic disorder that follows a stroke. Research on its management is limited, and no review has evaluated all therapies for central poststroke pain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to evaluate therapies for central poststroke pain. We identified eligible trials, in any language, through systematic searches of AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO. Eligible trials (1) enrolled ≥ 10 patients with central poststroke pain; (2) randomly assigned them to an active therapy or a control arm; and (3) collected outcome data ≥ 14 days after treatment. Pairs of reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts of identified citations, reviewed full texts of potentially eligible trials, and extracted information from eligible studies. We used a modified Cochrane tool to evaluate risk of bias of eligible studies and collected patient-important outcomes according to recommendations by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials. We conducted, when possible, random effects meta-analyses and evaluated our certainty in treatment effects using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System.

- **Results**: Eight eligible English language randomized controlled trials (459 patients) tested anticonvulsants, an antidepressant, an opioid antagonist, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and acupuncture. Results suggested that all therapies had little to no effect on managing central poststroke pain.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^116sKWwv]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Pure sensory stroke (PSS) is a lacunar syndrome affecting various areas of the somatosensory system. PSS is defined as a specific type of stroke displaying prominent hemisensory symptoms without other major neurological deficits. While thalamic stroke remains the most common cause of PSS, it can also manifest secondary to small non-thalamic lesions involving the cerebral cortex, internal capsule, or brainstem. Unfortunately, brainstem lesions remain difficult to identify due to their relatively small size and may take days to weeks before changes are evident on imaging studies. Brainstem pure or predominant sensory strokes are usually caused by a paramedian dorsal pontine lesion involving the medial lemniscus tract and can present with mild transient non-sensory symptoms, most commonly dizziness and gait ataxia. Acute ocular pain has also been implicated in impending brainstem ischaemia. This case report highlights a pure sensory brainstem stroke with subtle clinical features that help to localize its origin within the brain. It stresses the importance of performing an accurate history and thorough clinical exam while maintaining a high index of suspicion for brainstem lesions.

### Current understanding of thalamic structure and function in migraine [^113JYPw4]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

To review and discuss the literature on the role of thalamic structure and function in migraine, the thalamus holds an important position in our understanding of allodynia, central sensitization, and photophobia in migraine. Structural and functional findings suggest abnormal functional connectivity between the thalamus and various cortical regions, pointing towards altered pain processing in migraine. Pharmacological nociceptive modulation suggests that the thalamus is a potential drug target.

A critical role for the thalamus in migraine-related allodynia and photophobia is well established. Additionally, the thalamus is most likely involved in the dysfunctional pain modulation and processing in migraine, but further research is needed to clarify the exact clinical implications of these findings.

- **Multimodal MRI**: Plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of thalamic lesions.

- **Bilateral thalamic lesions**: Should point to venous thrombosis, which is reversible if treated early.

- **MR imaging**: Is crucial for guiding stereotactic surgical positioning of DBS electrodes.

- **Main differential diagnosis**: Of bilateral thalamic lesions are tumor, ischemia, and venous thrombosis.

### Reversal of thalamic hand syndrome by long-term motor cortex stimulation [^113ts3NB]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2000). Low credibility.

The authors describe a case of complete recovery from the so-called "thalamic hand" syndrome following chronic motor cortex stimulation in a 64-year-old man suffering from post-stroke thalamic central pain. As of the 2-year follow-up examination, the patient's dystonia and pain are still controlled by electrical stimulation. It is speculated that a common mechanism, in which the thalamocortical circuit loops are rendered out of balance, may sustain hand dystonia and central pain in this case of thalamic syndrome. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind.

### Prediction of central post-stroke pain by quantitative sensory testing [^115RrZDb]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects were enrolled from patients with an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke affecting the somatosensory system at the Charité‐Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany, between 2010 and 2016. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (EA4/003/10) and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to inclusion.

Inclusion criteria included age between 18 and 85 years and a transient or persistent somatosensory deficit with a corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven acute unilateral stroke within central parts of the somatosensory system (i.e. medulla oblongata, pons, thalamus, internal capsule, or somatosensory cortices). A transient somatosensory deficit was defined as a sensory symptom present in the acute phase at presentation but recovering spontaneously or after treatment. A persistent somatosensory deficit was defined as a sensory symptom that did not recover during the study period. Exclusion criteria are detailed in the supplementary methods. The neurological examination included detailed sensory and motor testing to diagnose the underlying etiology. In patients who reported pain, pain intensity, pain quality, pain course, and pain duration were assessed using validated pain questionnaires.

According to Klit et al., central post-stroke pain (CPSP) was defined as pain that occurred as a direct result of a stroke to the central somatosensory system, confirmed by MRI, in the body area corresponding to the somatosensory deficit (e.g. hypoesthesia, paresthesia). Other causes of pain, such as nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic pain, were excluded.

### Thalamic amnesia after infarct: The role of the mammillothalamic tract and mediodorsal nucleus [^113hBBcQ]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Amnesia following thalamic lesions was first described several decades ago, particularly following strokes, but the mechanisms underlying the memory impairment remain unclear. It is crucial to establish whether the impairment is directly related to damage to specific nuclei, and if so, which ones, or whether it is indirectly related to lesions of the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), first described by Vicq d'Azyr in 1786, linking the hippocampus to the thalamus via a synapse in the mammillary body.

As the anterior nucleus (AN) is connected with the hippocampus and the MTT, it was assumed to explain the memory impairment. The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) is another candidate owing to its dense connections with subhippocampal structures. The MTT runs through the medial thalamus. Therefore, anterior-medial thalamic strokes may also damage the MTT and cause memory impairment. An important caveat in previous studies is that many have relied on single or a few cases. Neuroimaging has been absent or of poor quality, and few studies have used a thalamic atlas fused with MRI scans to identify the damaged structures. Furthermore, because of the close vicinity of the AN, MD, and MTT, it is usually hard to say which structure is responsible for the memory impairment observed in thalamic stroke patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of the AN, MD, and MTT in thalamic amnesia following a stroke.

### Paradoxical heat sensation as a manifestation of thermal hypesthesia: A study of 1090 patients with lesions of the somatosensory system [^111hfVtd]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was approved by the local ethics committees at each participating center, and all patients provided written informed consent for their data to be collected and analyzed in the database. All procedures adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Study design**: All patients were tested in a single setting using the QST protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS), during which the presence or absence of paradoxical heat sensation was recorded. Patients completed the questionnaire prior to the assessment. Fifteen pain facilities across Europe participated in data gathering in three consortia: the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS), IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative) EUROPAIN, and NEUROPAIN. All centers underwent strict quality assessment, and data were compiled in a central database in Bochum, Germany. An analysis showed a high degree of homogeneity among participating centers, allowing the database to be analyzed as a homogeneous group. Subsets of this database, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been published previously.

- **Inclusion or exclusion criteria**: We included patients with confirmed peripheral neuropathic pain due to polyneuropathy or unilateral peripheral lesions (peripheral nerve injury, postherpetic neuralgia, or radiculopathy); patients with central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury, syringomyelia, or stroke; and patients with similar conditions.

### Analgesic and placebo effects of thalamic stimulation [^1169eBRu]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical studies have reported successful relief of chronic pain with sensory thalamic stimulation. However, even with the extensive use of sensory thalamic stimulation as a clinical tool in the relief of chronic pain, the results are still inconsistent. This discrepancy could probably be explained by the fact that the majority of these studies are case reports or retrospective analyses, which have often used imprecise pain measurements that do not allow a rigorous statistical evaluation of pain relief. None of these studies measured the effect of stimulation on clinical pain for longer than a few hours per day, which is an important aspect considering that clinical pain can vary over time. Moreover, placebo controls are seldom included.

In the study, we measured patients' pain perception at home over a two-week period, both during days of normal stimulation of the sensory thalamus and during days without stimulation. Patients also came to the laboratory to assess the effects of thalamic and placebo stimulation on clinical pain, experimental heat pain, innocuous air puff, and visual stimulation. A potential relation between the perceived paresthesia and analgesic efficacy during thalamic and placebo stimulation was also explored. We found that thalamic stimulation significantly affected clinical and experimental pain perception, but an important placebo component also exists. On the other hand, neither thalamic nor placebo stimulation affected air puff and visual ratings, suggesting that the effect applies specifically to pain and hence is not caused by a broader sensory alteration.

### Central post-stroke pain: Clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management [^1174TuEt]. The Lancet Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome that can occur following a cerebrovascular accident. This syndrome is characterized by pain and sensory abnormalities in the body parts that correspond to the brain territory that has been injured by the cerebrovascular lesion. The presence of sensory loss and signs of hypersensitivity in the painful area in patients with CPSP might indicate the dual combination of deafferentation and the subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability.

The exact prevalence of CPSP is not known, partly owing to the difficulty in distinguishing this syndrome from other pain types that can occur after stroke, such as shoulder pain, painful spasticity, persistent headache, and other musculoskeletal pain conditions. Future prospective studies with clear diagnostic criteria are essential for the proper collection and processing of epidemiological data. Although treatment of CPSP is difficult, the most effective approaches are those that target the increased neuronal hyperexcitability.

### Practice parameter: The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115ZxHJz]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain. The purpose of this study is to answer several important questions:

- **In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause?**
- **Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e. a structural cause such as a tumor)?**
- **Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression?**
- **Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia?**
- **When should surgery be offered?**
- **Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?**

- **Methods**: The study involved a systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

- **Conclusions**:

In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U).

Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control, while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression are options for treatment.

### Double-blind clinical trial of thalamic stimulation in patients with Tourette syndrome [^116p2NSA]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation of the thalamus has been proposed as a therapeutic option for patients with Tourette syndrome who are refractory to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. Patients with intractable Tourette syndrome were invited to participate in a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial assessing the efficacy and safety of stimulating the centromedian nucleus-substantia periventricularis-nucleus ventro-oralis internus crosspoint in the thalamus.

After surgery, patients were randomly assigned to either 3 months of stimulation followed by 3 months off stimulation (Group A) or vice versa (Group B). The cross-over period was followed by 6 months of on-stimulation. Assessments were conducted prior to surgery and at 3, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was a change in tic severity as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. The secondary outcome involved changes in associated behavioral disorders and mood. Cognitive side effects were examined during on-stimulation 1 year postoperatively.

Interim analysis was conducted on a sample of six male patients, with only one patient randomized to Group B. Tic severity during on-stimulation was significantly lower than during off-stimulation, showing a substantial improvement of 37% on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (mean 41.1 ± 5.4 vs. 25.6 ± 12.8, P = 0.046). The effect of stimulation 1 year after surgery remained sustained with a significant improvement of 49% on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (mean 42.2 ± 3.1 vs. 21.5 ± 11.1, P = 0.028) compared with preoperative assessments.

### Disappearance of central thalamic pain syndrome after contralateral parietal lobe lesion: Implications for therapeutic brain stimulation [^112eMnKN]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

At present, there is hardly any appropriate therapy available for central pain syndromes. We report on a unique case of central thalamic pain syndrome that did not respond to any therapy but disappeared after an additional contralateral parietal lobe lesion. This example indicates that lesions affecting the bilateral balance of thalamo-parietal circuits may lead to pain relief in patients with central pain syndrome, which probably constitutes a bilateral disorder of functional plasticity. This should be taken into account in chronic brain stimulation for persistent pain states.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^117D251R]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings challenge the uniformity and severity of cognitive impairments traditionally associated with thalamic lesions by demonstrating that most patients had no or minor cognitive deficits. Our analysis revealed the heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes depending on the lesion's laterality and the specific thalamic territories impacted. Notably, lesions within the left thalamus and those affecting the mamillothalamic tract significantly correlate with more profound cognitive deficits, particularly in verbal memory, attention, and executive functions. In addition, our connectome analysis points to effects far beyond the thalamus proper of thalamic strokes. These results suggest that we should adopt a more holistic understanding of the thalamus, considering its integral role in the broader neural network governing cognitive functions.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^117B1nY4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms lasting from a few seconds to 2 minutes. The frequency of these paroxysms can range from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Periods of remission can last for months to years but tend to shorten over time.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Pharmacological treatments**: baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate
	- **Surgical and procedural interventions**: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, microvascular decompression, nerve block, stereotactic radiosurgery
	- **Alternative and other treatments**: peripheral acupuncture, proparacaine eye drops

### Vascular syndromes of the thalamus [^117BC8kM]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews the anatomy, connections, and functions of the thalamic nuclei, their vascular supply, and the clinical syndromes that result from thalamic infarction.

- **Summary of review**: Thalamic nuclei are composed of five major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved.

	- Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis, hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^116hvJB3]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Thalamic strokes produce neurological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms depending on the thalamic nuclei involved. While traditionally associated with severe cognitive deficits, recent studies suggest more modest impairments. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the severity of cognitive impairment following thalamic stroke.

- **Methods**: We recruited 40 patients (mean age 51.1) with chronic isolated thalamic stroke and 45 healthy subjects (mean age 48.5) who underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to discriminate patients from healthy subjects based on cognitive tasks. Disconnectome maps and cortical thickness were analyzed to understand the distant impact of thalamic strokes.

- **Results**: Two cognitive profiles emerged from the cluster analysis. Cluster 1 included mostly healthy subjects (n = 43) and patients with no or minor deficits (n = 20). Cluster 2 included patients (n = 19) and two healthy subjects with severe deficits in verbal memory, executive functions, and attention. Cluster 1 encompassed all patients with right thalamic stroke, while Cluster 2 included all patients with bilateral stroke or mammillothalamic tract interruption. Patients with left-sided stroke were equally divided between clusters. Significant differences between clusters included age, education, interthalamic adhesion disruption, lesion volume, and location. Patients with left-sided stroke in Cluster 2 had more lateral thalamic lesions and greater disruption of the anterior thalamic projection.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^112y9sEf]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the thalamus in maintaining human consciousness by testing whether thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal, as questioned by Hindman et al. Our results support their observations, demonstrating that thalamic strokes without extension into the brainstem are not sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of the thalamus in consciousness and provide valuable information for neurocritical care. In addition, our results suggest critical involvement of upper brainstem regions, intersected by lesions leading to severe impairment of arousal but not by any of the control lesions, in maintaining arousal.

The thalamus has been thought to play an important role in human consciousness, acting as the main relay point between the brainstem and cortex. Thalamic infarcts may lead to disorders of consciousness, but coma or stupor seems to be relatively rare, and it has not been clear if thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Together with the previous findings, our results instead support a critical role for the brainstem reticular formation, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and likely most importantly, axons ascending through the central midbrain, for sustaining human wakefulness. This view is also supported by an earlier study investigating brainstem lesions, showing that injury to a small region in the pontine tegmentum is associated with coma.

### Blood flow responses to deep brain stimulation of thalamus [^114Z3DK4]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) provides remarkable relief of tremor in the limbs contralateral to the side of the brain stimulated. The benefits have been sufficiently dramatic such that this is now an accepted clinical treatment for essential as well as other forms of tremor. Despite this clinical benefit, the mechanism of action of DBS remains unknown. In this investigation, we sought to determine the effects of VIM DBS on neuronal function.

- **Methods**: The authors used PET measurements of qualitative regional cerebral blood flow in patients with essential tremor to determine the effects of DBS in the left VIM. Each subject had four to six scans with the arms at rest and DBS turned either on or off during alternate scans. Continuous physiologic monitoring revealed no tremor during any of the scans. The PET images from each subject were aligned, averaged, and co-registered to a standard image oriented in stereotactic space.

- **Results**: The authors used subtraction image analysis with statistical parametric mapping methods and a restricted volume search to identify a significantly increased flow response at the site of stimulation in the thalamus. An exploratory analysis revealed increased flow in the ipsilateral supplementary motor area, a region that receives afferents from VIM.

- **Conclusions**: The increased blood flow at terminal fields of thalamocortical projections suggests that DBS stimulates and does not inactivate projection neurons in VIM thalamus.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^113eRBom]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The thalamus has been considered critical for maintaining consciousness, but it is not clear if thalamic strokes can lead to severe impairment of arousal. The aim of this study was to investigate whether thalamic damage alone is sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal in stroke patients.

Patients with new-onset ischemic stroke without mass effect, leading to severe impairment of arousal, were identified retrospectively from the electronic medical records of patients treated between 2004 and 2019 at Turku University Hospital. In addition, 500 stroke patients without impairment of arousal were included as controls.

We identified nine patients with coma or stupor following an acute stroke involving the thalamus. Five of these patients remitted following endovascular therapies but had residual lesions intersecting the thalamus. In the four patients with long-term coma or stupor, the thalamic lesions extended into the brainstem and overlapped in regions considered part of the reticular formation. These brainstem regions were specific for patients with long-term coma or stupor, as none of the five patients who remitted following endovascular therapy or 500 control stroke patients (including 39 patients with stroke lesions intersecting the thalamus) had lesions intersecting these regions.

These results demonstrate that thalamic strokes without extension into the brainstem are not sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal.

### The thalamus and behavior: Effects of anatomically distinct strokes [^116kovFi]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Data on behavioral changes after thalamic lesion are sparse and largely based on isolated reports of patients with thalamic strokes. However, recent findings suggest that behavioral patterns can be delineated on the basis of the four main arterial thalamic territories.

- **Anterior pattern**: Consists mainly of perseverations and superimposition of unrelated information, apathy, and amnesia.
- **Paramedian infarct**: The most frequent features are disinhibition syndromes, including personality changes, loss of self-activation, amnesia, and, in the case of extensive lesions, thalamic "dementia". This pattern may often be difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially when neurologic dysfunction is lacking.
- **Inferolateral lesion**: Executive dysfunction may develop but is often overlooked, although it may occasionally lead to severe long-term disability.
- **Posterior lesion**: While cognitive dysfunction with neglect and aphasia are well known, no specific behavioral syndrome has been reported.

In the future, perfusion CT, functional MRI, and tractography using diffusion imaging in stroke patients may provide a better understanding of the role of the corticothalamic relationship in behavioral changes associated with thalamic stroke.

### How central is central poststroke pain? The role of afferent input in poststroke neuropathic pain: A prospective, open-label pilot study [^116FyJ5u]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain disorder, the underlying mechanisms of which are not well understood. It has been suggested that stroke-associated loss of inhibitory neurons in the spinothalamic tract causes disinhibition of thalamic neurons, which autonomously generate ectopic nociceptive action potentials responsible for the pain experience. We hypothesized that CPSP is a result of misinterpretation of afferent sensory input by the sensitized neurons within the brain, rather than being generated spontaneously by the damaged central nervous system (CNS) neurons.

To test this hypothesis, we prospectively recruited 8 patients with definite CPSP affecting at least 1 extremity. In an open-label intervention, an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block with lidocaine was performed to block afferent sensory input from a painful extremity. Spontaneous and evoked pain, neuropathic pain descriptors, and lidocaine plasma concentrations were measured. The blockade of peripheral sensory input resulted in complete abolition of pain in 7 of the 8 subjects within 30 minutes (the primary outcome measure of the study), and more than 50% pain relief in the remaining participant. Median (interquartile range) spontaneous pain intensity changed from 6.5 (4.3–7.0) at baseline to 0 (0–0) after the block (P = 0.008). All mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity was abolished by the nerve block.

The results suggest that it is unlikely that CPSP is autonomously generated within the CNS. Rather, this pain is dependent on afferent input from the painful region in the periphery and may be mediated by such input.

### Frequency, clinical presentation and outcome of vigilance impairment in patients with uni- and bilateral ischemic infarction of the paramedian thalamus [^116WD6dY]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Frequency of additional symptoms and their effect on time to diagnosis as well as outcome

In our sample, only 60% of patients with paramedian lesions and vigilance impairment showed additional gaze palsy. Moreover, only about half of these patients showed additional sensorimotor symptoms. Gaze palsy and other forms of oculomotor symptoms are known to occur in infarction of the artery of Percheron and after isolated thalamic or complex midbrain infarctions. However, the frequency of presentation in isolated lesions of the paramedian thalamus and co-occurrence with vigilance impairment are not known. Previous studies have shown the occurrence of vertical gaze palsy or complex oculomotor symptoms in up to 40% of patients with uni- or bilateral paramedian strokes; however, patients with additional midbrain lesions were not excluded, making correlation to specifically thalamic infarction difficult. Furthermore, no account was made for the co-occurrence of altered vigilance states. Our results, showing a significant association of presence of gaze palsy with vigilance impairment in up to 60% of patients, stress the importance of screening for accompanying oculomotor symptoms.

Of note, time to diagnosis (TtD) was significantly shorter when patients presented with additional symptoms such as gaze palsy or sensorimotor symptoms. Patients who presented with such accompanying symptoms were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke almost 30 hours earlier than patients that only showed vigilance impairment without accompanying deficits. As this could impact further treatment options, it emphasizes the importance of early and comprehensive diagnosis.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^114FUFQ9]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Thalamic strokes are known to impact various neural functions due to their strategic location. However, the link between pure thalamic strokes and severe arousal impairment must be explored further. This study examines the potential outcomes of thalamic strokes, focusing on arousal deficits.

- **Methodology**: The research utilizes a combination of clinical assessments and imaging techniques to investigate the aftereffects of thalamic strokes. Participants were assessed for changes in arousal and other neurological functions following stroke incidents. Advanced imaging provided insights into the extent and specific locations of thalamic damage contributing to these outcomes.

- **Results**: Findings suggest that pure thalamic strokes can indeed lead to significant impairments in arousal, highlighting the complexity of thalamic functions. The study provides detailed case analyses demonstrating varying degrees of impairment, which correlate with specific regions within the thalamus.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the critical role of the thalamus in maintaining arousal and suggests that clinicians should closely monitor stroke survivors for potential arousal deficits. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols for diagnosis and rehabilitation following thalamic strokes.

### Evolution of neuropsychological deficits in first-ever isolated ischemic thalamic stroke and their association with stroke topography: A case-control study [^115FGmtY]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, most studies retrospectively assessed cognitive deficits in smaller cohorts or case reports, and the majority of them used chronic stroke patients without matched control subjects. Longitudinal studies comparing neuropsychological deficits of patients with thalamic stroke with age- and sex-matched control subjects at predefined time points with a standardized comprehensive neuropsychological test battery were lacking. Whereas our longitudinal design with 24 months follow-up allows for the assessment of long-term stroke recovery, we were able to track the complete cohort of 37 patients only for 12 months. A total of 8 patients were missing at the 24-month follow-up (5 refused participation, 2 had reinfarcts, 1 died), which could lead to systematic bias in the patient evaluation at the 24-month time point. The 8 patients lost to follow-up, however, did not statistically differ in age, sex, and each of the cognitive domains before their dropout from patients who completed the 24-month follow-up.

We did not perform any systematic assessment of prestroke cognitive performance in patients with thalamic stroke. Yet, in the detailed patient interview upon admission, neither the patients nor accompanying relatives nor previous medical records reported prestroke cognitive deficits. The 3 thalamic stroke topographies evaluated in our study had different age, sex, and vascular risk profiles. Patients with paramedian thalamic stroke were younger, more often female, and healthier than anterior and inferolateral thalamic stroke patients.

### Fluctuating drowsiness following cardiac catheterisation: Artery of Percheron ischaemic stroke causing bilateral thalamic infarcts [^113fdHai]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

An 81-year-old man underwent cardiac catheterisation to investigate breathlessness and left ventricular impairment of unknown cause. He had unobstructed coronary arteries. Immediately following the procedure, he became suddenly unresponsive with vertical gaze palsy, anisocoria, and bilateral upgoing plantar responses. He made a rapid recovery to his premorbid state 25 minutes later with no residual focal neurological signs. He then experienced multiple unresponsive episodes, interspersed with complete resolution of symptoms and neurological signs.

MRI of the brain identified bilateral medial thalamic infarcts and midbrain infarcts, consistent with an artery of Percheron territory infarction. By the time the diagnosis was reached, the thrombolysis window had elapsed. The unresponsive episodes diminished with time, and the patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. At a 6-month review after the episode, the patient exhibited a degree of progressive cognitive impairment.

### Pure representational neglect after right thalamic lesion [^117FfNs4]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

After a right thalamic stroke, an 86-year-old man presented with acute pure left representational neglect without any perceptual neglect. On spatial mental imagery tasks, the patient systematically omitted items located on his left side, but only when a vantage point was given. This suggests that:

- **Representational neglect analysis**: Pure representational neglect is not just a residual finding after recovery from global (perceptual and representational) neglect.
- **Spatial representation processes**: Space representation can be coded by two independent processes: in viewer-centered or world-based (allocentric) coordinates.
- **Thalamic function in spatial imagery**: The right thalamus serves as a relay in the processing of spatial visual imagery.

### Long-term functional outcome in patients with isolated thalamic stroke: The KOSCO study [^117KbRo3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

This study discusses the long-term functional outcomes in patients who have experienced isolated thalamic strokes. Such strokes can significantly impact various aspects of a patient's life, but specific long-term data is often lacking. The research offers valuable insights and data that may help in understanding the progression and rehabilitation needs for these individuals.
