## Question

are these med ok to take during pregnancy-isotretinoin and spironolactone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether isotretinoin and spironolactone are safe to take during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and boxed warnings for isotretinoin. Then, I should verify the specific teratogenic risks and the iPLEDGE REMS requirements. Next, I will examine spironolactone's mechanism and animal data, followed by human pregnancy data and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and outline safer alternatives and contraception counseling, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm isotretinoin's status. Isotretinoin is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy across all trimesters, with multiple FDA labels explicitly warning of life-threatening birth defects and requiring participation in the iPLEDGE REMS program for all patients who can become pregnant, including two negative pregnancy tests before initiation and monthly testing during therapy, plus effective dual contraception for one month before, during, and one month after treatment [^b8580712] [^9b66f17a] [^992adbe0].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and nature of isotretinoin teratogenicity. Human data document a high risk of major congenital malformations affecting the face, skull, ears, eyes, CNS, cardiovascular system, and endocrine organs, along with increased spontaneous abortion and premature birth; importantly, there is no safe threshold of exposure during pregnancy, and any exposure warrants immediate discontinuation and specialist counseling, which is why the REMS exists to prevent exposed pregnancies [^992adbe0] [^b8580712].

> Hold on, I should verify spironolactone next. Spironolactone is not categorized as absolutely contraindicated like isotretinoin, but it is generally avoided in pregnancy due to anti-androgenic effects and animal data showing feminization of male fetuses; the FDA labeling advises avoiding spironolactone in pregnant women or counseling about potential risk to a male fetus, and contemporary guidelines list spironolactone among agents contraindicated for acne in pregnancy, reflecting a precautionary stance rather than definitive human teratogenicity data [^06fe731d] [^b20e2bd4] [^1d3a3409].

> I need to check the strength of human evidence for spironolactone. Limited case reports and series have not shown a clear increase in major malformations, but the concern remains theoretical and mechanism-based; importantly, there are no robust prospective human data establishing safety, and the balance of risk–benefit in pregnancy favors avoidance unless compelling maternal indications exist, in which case shared decision-making with maternal–fetal medicine is advised [^06fe731d] [^b20e2bd4].

> But wait, what if someone argues spironolactone is "less teratogenic than tetracyclines" and therefore acceptable? I should double-check that claim. While some reviews note spironolactone may be less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines, this does not translate into pregnancy safety; tetracyclines themselves are contraindicated in the second and third trimesters, and spironolactone remains nonrecommended for acne in pregnancy, so using a comparative argument to justify spironolactone in pregnancy would be misleading and unsafe [^1d3a3409] [^3d192071].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives during pregnancy. For acne in pregnancy, topical therapies such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, topical clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide, and topical metronidazole are preferred; oral antibiotics like amoxicillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, azithromycin, or clindamycin can be considered for moderate-to-severe disease, while isotretinoin and spironolactone should be avoided, and topical retinoids are generally avoided as a precaution despite limited systemic absorption [^1d3a3409] [^4f081a53].

> I will now examine contraception and preconception planning, because prevention of exposure is key. For isotretinoin, dual contraception with at least one highly effective method and strict adherence to iPLEDGE are mandatory; for spironolactone, even though it is not under iPLEDGE, reliable contraception should be used in patients who could become pregnant, and any planned pregnancy should prompt medication discontinuation in advance, ideally during preconception counseling to adjust therapies safely [^9b66f17a] [^e8a1cd13].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Isotretinoin is never acceptable in pregnancy and requires immediate cessation and specialist involvement if exposure occurs, given the high risk of severe teratogenicity. Spironolactone is not absolutely contraindicated like isotretinoin, but it should be avoided in pregnancy due to theoretical anti-androgenic risks to a male fetus and lack of reassuring human safety data, so it is not "okay" to take during pregnancy for acne management [^992adbe0] [^06fe731d] [^1d3a3409].

> Final answer: No, isotretinoin and spironolactone are not okay to take during pregnancy. Isotretinoin is absolutely contraindicated and requires participation in iPLEDGE with dual contraception and monthly pregnancy testing. Spironolactone should be avoided in pregnancy due to potential anti-androgenic effects on a male fetus, and if pregnancy is planned, spironolactone should be stopped beforehand; safer topical and selected oral antibiotic alternatives should be used for acne in pregnancy under medical supervision [^b8580712] [^9b66f17a] [^06fe731d] [^1d3a3409].

Isotretinoin is **absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy** due to a high risk of severe birth defects, spontaneous abortion, and neurodevelopmental impairment; it requires strict pregnancy prevention measures via the iPLEDGE REMS program [^b8580712] [^992adbe0]. Spironolactone is **not considered safe in pregnancy** because of anti-androgenic effects and animal data suggesting potential feminization of male fetuses; it should be avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and alternative therapies are unsuitable [^06fe731d] [^b20e2bd4]. If either drug is used inadvertently, immediate discontinuation and urgent maternal-fetal consultation are recommended [^992adbe0].

## Isotretinoin

### Teratogenicity and fetal risks

- **Severe birth defects**: Facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, microphthalmia, anotia, cardiovascular and CNS malformations, thymic and parathyroid abnormalities [^992adbe0].
- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Documented IQ scores < 85 and other neurodevelopmental deficits [^992adbe0].
- **Pregnancy loss**: Increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature birth [^992adbe0].

---

### Regulatory status and pregnancy prevention

- **Contraindication**: Absolute contraindication in pregnancy; Category X [^b8580712].
- **iPLEDGE REMS**: Mandatory risk management with two negative pregnancy tests before initiation, monthly tests during therapy, and two effective forms of contraception for one month before, during, and one month after treatment [^9b66f17a].
- **Immediate action**: Stop isotretinoin and refer for specialist counseling if pregnancy occurs [^992adbe0].

---

## Spironolactone

### Potential fetal risks

- **Anti-androgenic effects**: Theoretical risk of feminization of male fetuses based on animal data; human data are limited but concerning [^06fe731d] [^b20e2bd4].
- **Animal findings**: Rat studies show feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed in utero [^784e15ba].
- **Human data**: Limited case reports do not show a clear increase in major malformations, but risk cannot be excluded [^06fe731d].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Avoidance in pregnancy is advised; **use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks** and alternatives are unsuitable [^06fe731d] [^b20e2bd4]. If exposure occurs, **individualized risk assessment and counseling** are recommended, with consideration of stopping therapy [^06fe731d].

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^5638efb5]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

SAFA is a pragmatic, multicentre, double blind, randomised trial with two (1:1) parallel treatment arms: spironolactone compared with placebo. A pragmatic trial design was chosen to test the intervention in a real-life context. This design included a participant reported outcome measure and allowed concomitant use of topical treatments. The trial protocol paper has been published. We revised the target sample size (details later) and made amendments to allow retention of research participants during the covid-19 pandemic through flexible trial procedures, particularly through remote follow-up.

Participants

Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were women aged 18 years or over with facial acne for at least six months; had acne of sufficient severity to warrant treatment with oral antibiotics, as judged by the trial clinician; and had an investigator's global assessment (IGA) of least 2 (mild or worse). Women at risk of pregnancy had to be willing to use their usual hormonal or barrier method of contraception for the first six months of the trial and for at least four weeks afterwards. Participants had to be willing to partake and give written informed consent and had sufficient English to self-complete the Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire. We excluded potential participants if they: had a score from the IGA acne of 0–1 (clear or almost clear); had ever taken spironolactone; had taken oral isotretinoin within the past six months; had taken oral antibiotics (longer than one week) for acne within the previous month; started, stopped, or changed hormonal contraception, co-cyprindiol, or other hormonal treatment within the past three months, or were planning to start, stop, or change within the next three months; were intending to become pregnant in the next six months; were spironolactone contraindicated (eg, taking potassium sparing diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocker or hereditary problems of galactose intolerance); had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; or had serum potassium concentrations above the upper limit of laboratory reference range.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^8d4649a2]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Setting

Participants were recruited through primary care (search and mail-out or opportunistic recruitment), secondary care (opportunistic recruitment), and by advertising in the community and on social media. Baseline assessments were conducted in secondary care clinics to ensure standard clinical assessments because the IGA for acne was an inclusion criterion and an important secondary outcome. Baseline appointments also included a pregnancy test, blood test (to exclude renal impairment or raised serum potassium), participant photo (to aid subsequent recall about acne changes), and contraceptive counselling. A research nurse or dermatologist, or both, conducted the baseline visit.

Participants were followed up face-to-face (or by video call or telephone due to the covid-19 pandemic) in secondary care at six weeks and 12 weeks, with a primary outcome assessment at 12 weeks, and longer term follow-up by questionnaires at 24 weeks and up to 52 weeks.

Intervention and comparator

Trial participants were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg spironolactone or matched placebo (one tablet daily) for the first six weeks and then two tablets daily (totalling 100 mg spironolactone or matched placebo) at (or after) six weeks, providing the participant was tolerating side effects. Treatment continued for 24 weeks in both groups.

Participants in both groups could continue to use their usual topical treatments throughout the trial but adherence to topical treatment was not promoted beyond usual care. Participants were asked not to change topical treatments between baseline and 12 weeks or take oral treatments for acne other than study medication; although, women who had been on oral contraception for more than three months could continue this medication. After 12 weeks, participants in both groups could receive usual care, such as oral antibiotics, hormonal treatments, or isotretinoin, if judged necessary by their usual clinical team.

In both groups, spironolactone or placebo was stopped at 24 weeks, participants were informed of their treatment allocation and entered an unblinded follow-up period for up to 52 weeks. After 24 weeks, participants could seek any treatment from their usual clinical team, including spironolactone if they wished.

### An overview of acne therapy, part 2: hormonal therapy and isotretinoin [^29692335]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic actives for acne have changed little in the last decade. Recognition that acne is an inflammatory condition, not an infectious one, has led to a call for reduction in antibiotic use, which has culminated in a re-evaluation of our nonantibiotic choices. Spironolactone and oral contraceptives have become more acceptable first-line choices, and earlier use of isotretinoin has been proposed.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^1d1e4ca1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Two authors of this review (JDR, AML) confirm that, based on their extensive experience of successful use of the drug to treat large numbers of women with persistent or late-onset acne, spironolactone is pivotal to their clinical practice. Such experience suggests that the important role of spironolactone in this hard-to-manage patient population has been largely underrecognized and provided the rationale for this systematic review. What the review has highlighted is a paucity of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females. The results should not be misinterpreted to mean that the drug is ineffective at safe dosages, but rather that there is a lack of robust evidence in support of expert opinion, which currently drives treatment recommendations either for or against more widespread use.

Every one of the 10 RCTs was at high risk of bias, with the most common reason being lack of blinding. Even in the more recent trials, sample sizes were not justified by reporting of power calculations or the assumptions on which they had been based. This lack of difference in efficacy between treatments might have been due, at least in part, to insufficient power. Moreover, as no single outcome measure had been used consistently across the trials, pooling of data from similar comparisons was not possible.

The trials fell into two categories: (1) comparisons of spironolactone monotherapy versus placebo; and (2) comparisons of mono or combination therapy versus active treatment. GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence showed that all of the comparisons versus placebo were rated 'very low quality' and all of the comparisons versus active therapy were of low or very low quality. With one exception, the choices of active comparator did not include standard oral therapies such as antibiotics or isotretinoin, nor was there any direct head-to-head comparison of spironolactone monotherapy with a COC of proven anti-acne efficacy, such as cyproterone acetate plus ethinyl estradiol.

### Efficacy and safety of topical clascoterone cream, 1%, for treatment in patients with facial acne: two phase 3 randomized clinical trials [^9336ccca]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acne is the eighth most prevalent disease in the worldand affects more than 640 million people globally. The onset of acne often coincides with pubertal hormonal changes, and the condition affects approximately 85% of adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 25 years. However, acne can also persist into, or develop during, adulthood. Novel therapeutic innovations for the treatment of acne have been sparse in recent years, with no new mechanism of action introduced and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since isotretinoin in 1982.

Acne is a multifactorial condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes colonization in the pilosebaceous unit, and inflammation. Current first-line treatments targeting 1 or 2 aspects of acne pathophysiology include benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, and topical or oral antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance in acne is a concern. Oral isotretinoin, which may be used for more severe cases, affects multiple acnegenic pathways. Although efficacious for the treatment of acne, it is associated with adverse effects and must be used with caution in females of childbearing age owing to known teratogenicity. Females with acne can be treated with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) or spironolactone, both of which affect androgens.

Androgen receptors (ARs) are expressed throughout the skin and are found in the sebaceous glands, sebocytes, and dermal papilla cells. Circulating and locally (skin) synthesized androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) bind to the AR and stimulate sebum production in both males and females.

Androgen inhibition is an effective strategy for the treatment of acne in females. Certain COCs (eg, norgestimate, norethindrone) are approved by the FDA to treat acne in females; these drugs suppress androgen production, thereby reducing circulating androgens. Spironolactone is an aldosterone inhibitor and AR blocker, that is used off label to treat acne in females.

Both COCs and spironolactone are associated with systemic adverse effects, are contraindicated in pregnancy, and are unsuitable for use in males with acne. Other AR inhibitors and/or antiandrogens have not been approved for the treatment of acne in males.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^777a6a14]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenism follow-up in adolescents — Before initiation of any medical therapy, expectations of treatment should be discussed with the patient; for those using isotretinoin, these patients should be counseled to use dual methods of contraception (eg, condoms and an OCP) because of the significant risk of teratogenicity. During management, patients should be assessed at routine intervals (every 3–6 months) for adverse effects and response to treatment until their condition is stable; they then should be monitored annually. With combination therapy, often antiandrogens can be discontinued or tapered over time, with continuation of oral contraception as monotherapy. Monitoring serum androgens is not recommended. Although data are unclear, consider monitoring potassium levels if patients taking spironolactone have medical comorbidities that affect renal function, and management should be individualized based on spironolactone dose and other comorbidities. Adolescents with hirsutism or acne can be treated with a goal of symptom control before assignment of a final diagnosis, and anticipatory guidance is critical to help patients understand the timeline for expected responses to therapy.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^058507c5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Spironolactone, a synthetic 17-lactone steroid, acts as a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with moderate affinity for both progesterone and androgen receptors. Spironolactone is predominantly utilized in clinical practice as a potassium-sparing diuretic, however it has been used off-label for acne since the 1980s. A reduction in sebum may be achieved by blocking dihydrotestosterone binding to the androgen receptor within sebocytes and inhibiting androgen-induced sebocyte proliferation. The systemic effects of spironolactone on adrenal synthesis of androgen precursors may also contribute to clinical efficacy, although at therapeutic doses this may be unlikely. The diuretic effect of spironolactone may benefit women who experience a premenstrual acne flare associated with fluid retention.

Successful long-term management of acne in adult women presents a considerable therapeutic challenge. As an anti-androgen and potential inhibitor of sebogenesis, spironolactone represents a possible alternative to oral isotretinoin and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the only licensed anti-acne medications that significantly reduce sebum secretion, but which may be associated with serious adverse effects in some patients. Antibiotics are often over-prescribed in acne, drive antimicrobial resistance in targeted and non-targeted bacteria, and have no effect on sebum synthesis.

A Cochrane review focusing primarily on hirsutism included only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of oral spironolactone for acne in its analyses and concluded there was insufficient evidence for effectiveness in treating acne. In contrast, a narrative review, based largely on clinical experience, highlighted the potential therapeutic usefulness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females, and detailed recommendations about appropriate use and monitoring during therapy.

Take-home messages from these different reviews are contradictory. In view of this clinical uncertainty, we conducted a hybrid systematic review of all studies that had assessed the clinical efficacy of oral spironolactone for acne in women. The primary aim was to determine whether oral spironolactone monotherapy produces a degree of improvement in acne that is clinically important and comparable to conventional drug-based remedies. Secondary aims were to identify evidence that could better inform clinicians on the selection of patients likely to benefit, and/or reveal the most appropriate dosing regimen.

Research and knowledge gaps in acne — priority areas span populations, mechanisms, assessment, therapies, devices, and diet. Identified needs include treatment of acne in persons of color and in pregnant women; mechanistic work on molecular and cellular drivers, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, acne scar pathophysiology, and immunopathogenesis; clinical tools to better characterize acne in the office and validated patient‑reported outcomes; topical therapy data including efficacy, safety, and side effects in children 8–12 years of age plus compliance and allergy quantification; comparative studies on duration of oral antibiotics; hormonal questions including duration of therapy, large prospective studies of spironolactone for postadolescent women, comparative effectiveness trials of COCs, and standardized PCOS workup; isotretinoin long‑term safety (causal links to depression and inflammatory bowel disease), prevention of isotretinoin‑exposed pregnancies, and optimal total cumulative dosing; rigorous randomized and comparative‑effectiveness trials for acne chemical peels and for light and laser devices including sources/wavelengths and lesion types; and long‑term diet trials of low‑glycemic index diet, milk (skim vs whole), and prospective studies of fish oil, probiotics, oral zinc, and topical tea tree oil.

### Contraceptive use in acne [^84675303]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous follicle. It is well established that androgen hormones play a major role in sebum production and excretion, and are vital in the pathogenesis of acne. Isotretinoin notwithstanding, hormonal therapies such as combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and spironolactone are the only treatments that can affect sebum production and the androgen component of acne. Contraceptives are also used during isotretinoin therapy for pregnancy prevention. It is important for a dermatologist to be familiar with all the available methods of contraception to provide essential counseling to patients. The aim of this paper is to review the role of hormones in acne pathogenesis, discuss the use of hormonal therapies for acne, and detail various alternative contraceptive methods in relation to isotretinoin treatment and pregnancy prevention.

### Optimizing the trial design for a comparative effectiveness study of spironolactone versus oral antibiotics for women with acne: a Delphi consensus panel [^616dec87]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

For women with acne, their acne often persists into adulthood, with over 50% of women reporting acne between 20&ndash;29 years of age and over 35% of women reporting acne between 30&ndash;39 years of age.1 While mild acne can usually be managed with topical medications, moderate to severe acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, spironolactone, and isotretinoin.2 Although oral antibiotics are the most common systemic medication prescribed for women with moderate to severe acne, spironolactone may represent a safe and effective therapeutic alternative that can decrease our reliance on oral antibiotics for the treatment of acne.3&ndash;5 However, while spironolactone use is increasing, oral antibiotics are still prescribed 3 to 5 times more often than spironolactone.3.

Spironolactone for adult women

The results of the spironolactone for adult female acne trial, published in The BMJ in 2023, showed that oral spironolactone alongside topical treatment is effective for improving outcomes for women with persistent acne, with greater effects seen at 6 months than 3 months. Spironolactone was well-tolerated starting at a dose of 50 mg increasing to 100 mg per day, although higher doses can be associated with adverse effects, particularly menstrual irregularity. Previous small trials suggest that the effectiveness of spironolactone may be similar to oral tetracycline for acne, but comparable data are limited. Ongoing trials of spironolactone compared with oral tetracycline for acne mean that more information should be available in the next few years.

Baseline check of renal function and potassium levels is advised prior to starting spironolactone for acne. However, large observational studies show that abnormal renal function or potassium levels are very unusual in this population. Ongoing monitoring is unnecessary for most young women and has recently been advocated just for women aged over 45 years. Spironolactone is less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines commonly used for acne, so it would be appropriate for spironolactone to be treated with no special restriction beyond contraceptive counselling, as is the case for oral tetracyclines.

Spironolactone is not currently licensed for the treatment of acne. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises that clinicians can use a licensed medicine outside the terms of its licence (off-label prescribing) if they are satisfied that this is in the best interest of the patient, an alternative, licensed medicine would not meet the patient's needs and there is sufficient safety and efficacy evidence. In addition, the prescriber should take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including monitoring and follow-up.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^b2d60376]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^3d192071]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for health care

Although spironolactone has been used widely in the community to treat hypertension and some related disorders, the medication is not licensed for the management of acne and some clinicians might be reticent to prescribe it off license in this context. The findings from this trial show the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of spironolactone in women with acne. Adopting a combined approach using oral spironolactone and topical agents has the potential to reduce the long term prescribing of oral antibiotics and therefore to reduce the likelihood of emerging bacterial resistance. Treatment courses of spironolactone over three months are likely of greater benefit than shorter treatment duration.

Participants were given contraceptive advice at each visit and a pregnancy test was carried out at baseline, yet despite this measure, seven pregnancies were reported in the trial. Although spironolactone is cautioned against in pregnancy, the effects are probably less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines, which are commonly used for acne in young women, so in usual practice, spironolactone would be treated with no special restriction beyond contraceptive counselling. Consensus is growing that, although baseline checks of renal function and potassium levels is advisable before starting patients on spironolactone, ongoing monitoring is unnecessary for most young women.

Table 3.
Medical Management of Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Hormonal effect in hidradenitis suppurativa is suggested by typical disease onset around or after puberty, exacerbation during pregnancy for some patients (Fig. 3), association with PCOS, and worsening with menstrual cycles. The mechanism by which hormones affect the disease is unclear (there is no evidence for significant differences between hidradenitis suppurativa and control patients in mean basal levels of estrogen and other sex hormones), yet clinical evidence suggests that combination oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and finasteride can be effective (Table 3). Both ethinyl estradiol with norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol with cyproterone acetate resulted in similar improvement, with 50% (12/24) of patients improving or clearing completely. Progestin-only contraceptives should be used cautiously; a case series suggests these may sometimes trigger hidradenitis suppurativa. Spironolactone or finasteride should be considered as monotherapy in women with mild-to-moderate symptoms or as adjunctive agents for more severe disease. Patients reporting hidradenitis suppurativa flares around menses or with features of PCOS may more likely benefit. Metformin, 500 mg 2–3 times daily, was associated with significant improvement in a 24-week uncontrolled, prospective study. Most patients (22/25) were women with features of PCOS.

Oral retinoids are typically either ineffective in hidradenitis suppurativa, or have efficacy limited mostly to milder cases. – Expert opinion suggests acitretin is superior to isotretinoin, but comparative evidence is lacking. Oral retinoids should be prescribed by those familiar with side effects, including teratogenicity, and laboratory monitoring, and mostly considered if nodulocystic acne is concomitant.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^1af44c3f]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Participants in the spironolactone group were more likely to report overall acne improvement from baseline photo than those in the placebo group (table 3). Although this difference was not statistically significant at 12 weeks, the odds ratio was larger and statistically significant at 24 weeks (table 3). Post hoc analyses showed that this result equated to a number needed to treat of 5 (95% confidence interval 3 to 12) at 24 weeks.

Table 3
Secondary outcomes

Using the IGA score, clinicians were significantly more likely to consider treatment as successful for participants in the spironolactone group at 12 weeks (table 3). The IGA was not measured at 24 weeks because no face-to-face assessments were done at this point. The adjusted odds ratio from the participant's global assessment score at 12 weeks was not statistically significant, but was statistically significant at 24 weeks in favour of the spironolactone group (table 3).

Before unblinding at 24 weeks, a significantly higher proportion of people receiving spironolactone felt satisfied that their skin had been helped compared with those receiving placebo (table 3; number needed to treat of 4 (95% confidence interval 3 to 6)).

The results for all the other Acne-QoL subscales and for total Acne-QoL score at 12 and 24 weeks were also statistically significant in favour of the spironolactone group (appendix table S4).

Although numbers are small, up to 52 weeks, fewer women in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group reported that they were taking oral antibiotics (six (6%) of 103 v 12 (14%) of 89) or isotretinoin (two (2%) of 103 v six (7%) of 89) (appendix table S5). At the time of the final follow-up questionnaire (up to 52 weeks), women in both groups reported continuing or commencing spironolactone: 36 (35%) of 103 women in the intervention group and 25 (28%) of 89 in the control group reported that they were taking this medication.

### Post-adolescent acne in women: more common and more clinical considerations [^da9e1021]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Current evidence suggests that post-adolescent acne in women is on the rise. Acne in this subgroup of patients commonly follows a specific pattern that can often be treatment resistant and/or prone to relapse, including after oral isotretinoin therapy. With a plethora of medications to choose from for acne treatment, many of which have been used in the past by patients without success, dermatology practitioners often find oral contraceptives and spironolactone to be of benefit in otherwise healthy adult females. Also, some of these patients may have concurrent hormonal anomalies such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or other underlying endocrine disorders, which should also be appropriately worked up by the clinician and managed accordingly. This article reviews some of the underlying pathophysiological factors, available treatment options, and screening guidelines to assist clinicians in the management of acne in adult females.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^5147c512]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

While endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing some new insights, this systematic review has highlighted existing important gaps in the evidence about how best to utilize oral spironolactone in managing acne in women, including clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize the risk of side effects, the lowest effective dose, the possible requirement for concomitant therapies and what these should be, which types of acne are likely to be responsive, and how effective spironolactone is compared with standard therapies. It is interesting to note that several current acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone on the basis of consensus and/or expert opinion. Others either do not mention spironolactone, or specifically say it is regarded as ineffective, not recommended or there is insufficient evidence to support its use. All, including those that purport to be evidence-based, have failed to identify the majority of studies that were included in this systematic review. Although there were five relevant studies that, to date, have proved unobtainable (two of which were almost certainly duplicate publications of included case series), we are confident that all the RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until such time as higher quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will have to continue to rely on recommendations largely based on expert experience or reached via consensus of expert panels. While this review has identified some very-low-quality evidence which showed that the 200 mg daily dose was statistically significantly more effective than placebo versus inflamed lesions, it has also confirmed that this dose is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse side effects than lower doses. Hence, there would appear to be no merit in using these higher doses for managing acne, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. in obese women with PCOS). Data from the multiple case series suggest that any future RCT examining lower doses is likely to generate results that confirm the effectiveness and better safety profile of doses ≤ 100 mg/day.

### Trends in the proportion of young women and girls prescribed spironolactone [^8131b9f7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Spironolactone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cardiovascular disease, with clinical trials primarily evaluating drug safety among older adults with heart failure. However, it is also widely prescribed for androgen-related conditions such as acne in young women and girls, frequently requiring a higher dose than cardiovascular uses (100–200 mg/d vs 25 mg/d). To address the lack of trial data on higher doses in younger women, some safety issues have been evaluated through observational studies. However, concerns of vulvar pain from spironolactone-induced androgen deprivation have been raised in a case series, a potential safety concern not yet evaluated on a population scale. Given its established widespread use for acne, including among adolescents with increased susceptibility to hormonal impacts, targeted safety studies may be needed. However, the total proportion of younger women and girls using spironolactone across its broad range of indications is currently unknown. To inform the need for additional safety studies in this population, we assessed prescribing trends from 2000 to 2020 stratified by age.

### Spironolactone in adolescent acne vulgaris [^25d78518]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is the most common skin condition affecting adolescents, most likely due to elevated androgen levels during puberty. Androgens stimulate and enlarge the sebaceous glands and keratinocytes, resulting in increased production of sebum and abnormal hyperproliferation of keratinocytes which lead to the formation of acne lesions. Current standard of care for AV includes topical therapies for mild cases and antibiotics or oral retinoids for severe cases. In recent years, spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist and diuretic, has been applied to the treatment of AV due to its anti-androgen effects. Spironolactone is currently recommended in women who use oral contraceptives, are refractory to or contraindicated for standard treatment, show clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, or present with late-onset or persistent-recurrent AV past the teenage years. It is not prescribed to adolescents due to potential side effects; however, current data studying adults indicate that most side effects are mild, and that potential associations with hyperkalemia and increased risk of cancer are not sufficiently supported. Hence, we believe that spironolactone may be a safe and effective therapy for adolescent AV.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^2214a212]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^32b12677]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Side Effects Reported in RCTs and Case Series

None of the studies carried a clear statement as to how information on side effects had been elicited, e.g. spontaneous reporting versus an open-ended question at each visit. Within the RCTs, there was no difference in the proportion of participants who dropped out due to side effects: 14/303 (4.6%) receiving spironolactone at any dose versus 10/343 (2.9%) receiving the comparators (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71–3.52; p = 0.26). Dropout rates due to side effects could not be calculated for two trials. In the case series, 49/729 (6.7%) women dropped out due to the side effects of spironolactone (ITT population). This was not significantly different to the rate in the RCTs (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39–1.23; p = 0.20).

Due to inadequate reporting in 8/10 RCTs, the proportion of women experiencing any side effect(s) could not be calculated. In the case series, at least 241 women experienced side effects equivalent to 48.0% of the PP and 43.9% of the ITT population. Reported rates varied from 0 to 90.7%, with the highest rates associated with the 200 mg/day dose. The most common side effect in both the RCTs and case series was menstrual irregularities: 38/264 (14.4%) in the RCTs and 216/543 (39.8%) in the case series (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26–0.49; p < 0.00001). From the case series, it was apparent these were dose-related: 137/176 women receiving 200 mg/day experienced menstrual disturbances, compared with 66/349 on lower daily doses (RR 4.12, 95% CI 3.27–5.19; p < 0.00001).

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^6912d272]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) anti-androgens — clinical use, contraception, and safety considerations are as follows: In combination with effective contraception, anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS if there is a suboptimal response after a minimum of six months of COCP and/or cosmetic therapy; given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed, acknowledging the lack of evidence in the PCOS population; whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women and adolescents, parents/or guardian/s, regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses when anti-androgens are used and, to prevent this, women who can get pregnant should be strongly counselled to use effective contraception (e.g., intrauterine device or COCPs); anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in the presence of another effective form of contraception for women with contraindications for COCP therapy or when COCPs are poorly tolerated; when prescribing anti-androgens, healthcare professionals should consider that spironolactone at 25-100mg / day appears to have lower risks of adverse effects, cyproterone acetate at doses ≥ 10mg is not advised due to an increased risk including for meningioma, finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity, flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity, and the relatively limited evidence on anti-androgens in PCOS needs to be appreciated with small numbers of studies and limited numbers of participants.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

Spironolactone versus Placebo

Three trials evaluated this comparison. One provided useful data for a 200 mg daily dose in a crossover trial that examined 29 women. For the inflamed lesion count, the MD in favor of spironolactone was 26.1 lesions fewer, despite baseline imbalance in favor of the placebo (p < 0.00001; PP population of 21, both phases combined). Data for the first phase, which would be free of any potential carryover effects, were not reported. Combined data from both phases showed that 18/21 women taking spironolactone, compared with 5/21 taking placebo, reported improvement (RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.64–7.89; p = 0.001), and 15/20 versus 4/20 had at least a 50% reduction in inflamed lesion count (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.51–9.34; p = 0.005). In a mixed gender RCT, 24/30 participants receiving spironolactone (50 mg/day, including 27 women) improved, compared with 2/25 receiving placebo (PP population); separate data were unavailable for females. A similar problem arose in the third trial, which also included males. Data could not be extracted for three women receiving the 50 mg dose, but 6/9 women receiving doses of 100–200 mg/day improved, irrespective of which outcome measures were used (PP population). In neither mixed gender trial was the extent of improvement quantified. For details and quality of evidence, see Table 2.

Hirsutism in premenopausal women — antiandrogen efficacy and safety: In analyses of individual agents versus placebo, spironolactone 100 mg/d, finasteride 2.5 to 5 mg/d, and flutamide 500 mg/d each showed a significant reduction in hirsutism scores, and pooled across trials antiandrogens were significantly more effective than placebo with a weighted mean difference of −7.02 [95% CI (−11.51 to −2.52)]. Spironolactone is generally well tolerated but should not be used if there is renal impairment, may have a dose-dependent association with menstrual irregularity unless an OC is used concomitantly, and may rarely result in hyperkalemia; it may cause increased diuresis and occasionally postural hypotension and dizziness early in treatment. OCs containing DSP have a mild mineralocorticoid effect and should not be used with a potassium-sparing diuretic. If spironolactone is inadvertently used during early pregnancy, there is a danger that a male fetus could be feminized although the absolute risk is not known. Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is used worldwide but is not available in the United States, and in one systematic review the OC CPA (2 mg) with 35 mcg EE was similar to antiandrogen therapy and more effective than placebo.

Prepregnancy counseling — medication and supplement review specifies that all prescription and nonprescription medications should be reviewed during pregnancy counseling, the pregnancy safety of each medication and supplement should be discussed, and medications with potential teratogenicity should be reviewed with their specific risks. The importance of reliable contraception should be emphasized when a patient is taking potentially teratogenic medications, and for a patient who desires pregnancy, potentially teratogenic medication should be adjusted in collaboration with the prescribing health care provider before the patient discontinues contraception. The lowest effective doses of the safest medications should be used whenever it is medically reasonable to do so. Male partners should also be screened for the use of androgens, such as testosterone, because androgen use is associated with azoospermia and infertility in males, which may be reversible in some cases with cessation.

The only exceptions are if I have had surgery to remove the uterus (a hysterectomy) or both of my ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), or my doctor has medically confirmed that I am post-menopausal.

Initial: ______

4. I understand that hormonal birth control products are among the most effective forms of birth control. Combination birth control pills and other hormonal products include skin patches, shots, under-the-skin implants, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Any method of birth control can fail. That is why I must use two different birth control forms at the same time, starting one month before, during, and for one month after stopping therapy every time I have any sexual contact (penis-vaginal) with a partner who could get me pregnant, even if one of the forms I choose is hormonal birth control.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^a553bd14]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, treatment of PCOS in general populations is often symptom‐ and context‐dependent, but generally comprises lifestyle management as first‐line therapy, including diet modification and physical activity. Education and counselling around the chronic nature of the condition and psychological support are also vital aspects of management for women with PCOS. Pharmacotherapies are commonly used to manage PCOS, depending on individual needs and symptoms. Cosmetic light therapy, along with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is the recommended treatment for management of menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism and acne, with anti‐androgens as second‐line pharmacological treatments when COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. For individuals seeking fertility treatment, ovulation‐induction agents such as letrozoleare recommended as first‐line therapy. For metabolic features of PCOS including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dysglycemia, alongside lifestyle modification, metformin is recommended first line, and in some cases, glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists or metabolic surgery. Given the broad spectrum of symptoms and outcomes associated with PCOS, a tailored combination of lifestyle and pharmacological therapies is essential to improve quality of life and mitigate comorbidities in women with PCOS.

In pregnancy, however, the treatment of PCOS can present unique challenges. While lifestyle and/or weight management remain important and can improve pregnancy outcomes, the physiological demands of pregnancy, combined with the metabolic and endocrine disturbances characteristic of PCOS, often necessitate additional pharmacological support. However, pharmacological options used to manage PCOS in non‐pregnant individuals are unsuitable during pregnancy including the COCP and GLP‐1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide), due to contraindications and safety concerns. Anti‐androgens, including spironolactone and finasteride, are contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Similarly, thiazolidinediones, which can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic features pre‐pregnancy, have raised concerns around growth restriction and teratogenicity, precluding their use in pregnancy. While metformin has been used in pregnancy for decades, and offers a potentially safe pharmacological option for managing metabolic disturbances in PCOS pregnancies, its efficacy and long‐term safety have been questioned. Potential benefits include preventing early pregnancy loss and limiting excess GWG in PCOS pregnancies, but there are conflicting reports regarding its efficacy for other outcomes such as GDM, preterm birth, and preeclampsia. Furthermore, concerns regarding its long‐term safety, particularly for offspring metabolic health, continue to fuel debate and contribute to inconsistent clinical recommendations around the use of metformin during pregnancy.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^dd1b69c5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

### Compliance with pregnancy prevention measures during isotretinoin therapy [^7a5cd9f2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 150 women annually become pregnant while taking isotretinoin despite participation in the iPLEDGE program. Noncompliance with the requirement to be abstinent or use 2 contraceptive methods may be a contributing factor.

Objective

We sought to determine the degree of adherence to contraception or abstinence among women taking isotretinoin.

Methods

We conducted an anonymous survey of women of childbearing potential taking isotretinoin for at least 2 months.

Results

Among 75 participants, 21 (28%) chose abstinence as their primary means of pregnancy prevention, of whom 4 (19%) were sexually active during treatment. The most commonly chosen contraceptive methods among the 39 women who were sexually active were condoms (35, 90%) and oral contraceptive pills (18, 46%). Twelve women (31%) admitted to having intercourse at least once using 1 or fewer forms of contraception; 10 failed to use condoms, and 1 reported completely unprotected intercourse. Among sexually active oral contraceptive pill users, 7 (39%) reported missing 1 or more pills in the previous month.

Limitations

Data were self-reported, thus participants may have inaccurately reported contraception use.

Conclusions

Encouraging the use of highly effective, patient-independent contraception and limiting abstinence to women who have never been sexually active may further reduce the rate of isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^a6434291]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Information for Patients

See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.

Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Sotret is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients) form.
Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Sotret therapy is initiated, and that they should use 2 forms of effective contraception simultaneously for 1 month before starting Sotret, while taking Sotret, and for 1 month after Sotret has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. They should also sign second Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form prior to beginning Sotret therapy. They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using 2 forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Sotret at any time during pregnancy. Female patients should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another Sotret prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
Isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking Sotret, but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about 1 million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include 4 with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however 2 of these reports were incomplete, and 2 had other possible explanations for the defects observed.
Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Sotret treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Sotret and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Sotret treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient's family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Sotret therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of isotretinoin therapy.
Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, "anxious" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin.
Patients must be informed that they must not share Sotret with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events.
Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to Sotret.
Patients should be reminded to take Sotret with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid.
Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy.
Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during Sotret therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages).
Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight.
Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy.
Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with isotretinoin capsules in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal). There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK).
Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with isotretinoin capsules developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of isotretinoin capsules. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of isotretinoin capsules if any significant abnormality is found.
Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Sotret should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur.

### Is there a role for antiandrogen therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa? A systematic review of published data [^f72ce738]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa is a disease with deep-seated chronic painful nodules, abscesses, and draining sinus tracts, which manifests on the apocrine gland-rich skin areas of the body. Observational findings demonstrate that the disease usually appears after puberty, exhibits pre-menstrual flares in women, improves in pregnancy, and worsens post-partum, which indicates a role of hormones and particularly of androgens in its pathophysiology. Because increased androgen levels in serum have not been widely reported, an end-organ androgen hypersensitivity has been postulated.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present evidence for antiandrogen therapeutic options for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in different medical electronic databases using the keywords "hidradenitis", "suppurativa", "acne inversa", and "antiandrogen" on 1 December, 2018. The main therapeutic options were subsequently used as separate keywords with the disease terms in a separate search.

Results

The main therapeutic options yielded were cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, finasteride, and metformin. One randomized controlled crossover trial and seven case series were identified following use of a standard extraction form for eligibility.

Conclusion

The existing studies do not allow a robust evidence-based recommendation for the use of antiandrogens in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to define the role of hormonal treatment as an alternative or concomitant therapy together with antibiotics or biologics.

### Should dermatologists prescribe hormonal contraceptives for acne? [^7f6225d5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT One of the primary factors contributing to the development of acne vulgaris is excess sebum. Sebaceous glands and sebum excretion are regulated, at least in part, by androgen hormones. Acne treatments that block this androgen effect include spironolactone and combination oral contraceptives (COC). Three COC are now FDA approved to treat moderate acne. Dermatologists must become experts at prescribing these hormonal contraceptives. Likewise, it is vital to be aware of contraindications to hormonal contraceptive therapy. Proper patient selection relies on an appropriate medical history and an assessment of blood pressure. A pelvic exam and/or Papanicolaou smear are not required prior to initiating therapy with a COC. It is important to counsel patients about potential adverse effects of COC pills and to establish appropriate expectations concerning acne improvement.

### Interventions for hirsutism [^59d381dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What medical therapies are associated with greatest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating hirsutism?

Bottom Line

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been associated with improvement for mild hirsutism, as has flutamide (250 mg) twice daily and spironolactone for more severe cases. Finasteride and gonadotropin-releasing analogues are associated with inconsistent results and metformin is not associated with benefit.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^6c62f4e0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone

Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is frequently used in female patients with HS to counteract hormonal influences on disease activity. Spironolactone is not compatible with pregnancy because of its antiandrogen properties and ability to cross the placenta, which can interfere with the sexual development of a male fetus. A 2019 systematic review evaluating exposure to spironolactone in utero did not find significant evidence of feminization of male individuals; however, human data were limited to case reports. Of note, spironolactone is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding despite a potential risk of lactation suppression from diuresis.

Oral Contraceptive Pills

Combined oral contraceptive pills are used as monotherapy or in combination with spironolactone for female patients with HS, but are contraindicated during pregnancy. In terms of compatibility with breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pills may suppress lactation and there are some reports of infants experiencing breast enlargement while being breastfed by exposed mothers. Thus, it is generally recommended to wait until at least 6 weeks after delivery to start oral contraceptive pills.

### Spironolactone [^06fe731d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis [see Data]. Rat embryofetal studies report feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed to spironolactone in utero. Limited available data from published case reports and case series did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with spironolactone. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with heart failure, cirrhosis and poorly controlled hypertension during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Because of the potential risk to the male fetus due to anti-androgenic properties of spironolactone and animal data, avoid spironolactone in pregnant women or advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a male fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

 Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Clinical classification of heart disease may worsen with pregnancy and lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure.

### Long-term use of spironolactone for acne in women: a case series of 403 patients [^63c98252]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data regarding the long-term outcomes of spironolactone use for women with acne and its effect on truncal acne.

Objective

To comprehensively describe outcomes of patients treated with spironolactone in routine clinical practice, including long-term outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case series of 403 adult women treated for acne with spironolactone at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2019. Rates of objective, as assessed by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, and subjective acne clearance were evaluated, as well as rates of treatment discontinuation, dosage changes, and drug survival. Logistic regression was used to assess for association between incidence of menstrual adverse effects and combined oral contraceptive use.

Results

As evaluated by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, at the first follow-up, 75.5%, 84.0%, and 80.2% of patients with available data had reduction or complete clearance of acne on the face, chest, and back, respectively. The mean drug survival was 470.7 days. Menstrual adverse effects were less common among those using combined oral contraception (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.50).

Limitations

This study was conducted at a single academic medical center.

Conclusions

Spironolactone improves clinical outcomes and is well tolerated for many adult women with acne using it for an extended duration.

### Coping with the isotretinoin registry [^519e57ea]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

The isotretinoin registry has arrived. It has a lofty goal of preventing all isotretinoin pregnancies. How we got to this point and what the registry means to prescribers and patients have many dermatologists confused and concerned. Will it be burdensome, will it preclude the use in most offices of this most important drug? Will it breed a new group of "isotretinologists" who are willing to take on the challenge? This article endeavors to answer these questions and to put most concerns at rest. The new system seems ultimately to have few changes compared to the risk management program we are already (technically) following. The difference is that compliance with all the rules will be monitored and mandatory. The system seems user friendly, is accessible to the computer-savvy as well as those of us still addicted to telephone, and may well turn out to be much fuss made over minimal hassle. What is clear is that this is likely our last chance to save this wonderful drug from oblivion. It is time for dermatologists to step to the plate and do what is in the best interest of their patients.

### Isotretinoin: still the cause of anxiety for teratogenicity [^f0988c35]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin is known as a potent teratogenic agent. Pregnancy should be ruled out before isotretinoin is prescribed. In this study, we evaluated the fetal outcomes of pregnant women who had inadvertently been exposed to isotretinoin during or before pregnancy. We collected data of pregnant women who had admitted to the Teratology Information Service due to isotretinoin exposure. Data regarding medications and comorbidities were documented. Outcomes were grouped as: live births, stillbirths, live births with congenital malformations, induced abortions (due to fetal abnormalities), spontaneous abortions, and elective abortions. We found that three women had gone to elective abortions. Three babies were live born without birth defects, of which, maternal exposure periods were between 0 and 3weeks, 9 and 10weeks before last menstrual period. One woman, exposed to isotretinoin up to the fourth week of gestation, decided ongoing her pregnancy with no current drug-related complications. Although many risk management programs worldwide have been used to prevent isotretinoin-related teratogenicity, the results of the present study showed that women became pregnant during isotretinoin intake and opted for pregnancy termination. Attention should be paid to the risk management programs mandating effective contraceptions, in order to lessen the drug-related terminations.

### Compliance with national guidelines on isotretinoin: where are we 2 years since the last audit? Results of the national isotretinoin Re-audit 2014 [^95a402b3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In 2010, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) published clinical guidelines for the safe introduction and continued use of isotretinoin in patients with acne in the UK. The BAD provides UK dermatologists with a facility for national audit, and it undertook an audit on compliance with these guidelines in 2012.

Aim

To determine current clinical practices relating to use of isotretinoin among dermatologists in the UK (including geographical variations) as measured against BAD standards, and to ascertain any improvement since the 2012 audit.

Methods

The 2012 isotretinoin audit proforma was used, with additional questions on clinical setting, complaints and litigation. A web-based survey tool was used for data entry and submission, with email invitation to working, UK-based BAD members (n = 1226) in December 2013 and weekly reminders during the 8.5-week data collection period. Responders were requested to enter data for the three most recent consecutive patients (including one male and one female patient) who had completed treatment within the previous 6 months.

Results

In total, 338 (27.6%) respondents provided data on 1013 patients. Serum lipids were checked in 93.4% of patients and documentation of mental health and/or mood state was recorded in 82.1%. Regarding the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP), 91.6% of female patients of childbearing potential had signed the PPP information form, while 93.3% who had followed the PPP had taken pregnancy tests both before and during treatment, and 54.7% had taken a pregnancy test 5 weeks post-treatment.

Conclusion

Overall, there is currently good compliance with standards. Certain aspects of care that are less frequently preformed, such as pregnancy testing post-treatment, are highlighted.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^256d2136]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 June 2003). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. All included trials were small (no more than 41 participants) randomised and controlled. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Two trials investigated spironolactone versus placebo; one trial was a dosage studies of spironolactone; one trial compared spironolactone with spironolactone in combination with dexamethasone; one trial used topical spironolactone for the treatment of acne, one trial compared three treatments; spironolactone, finasteride, cyproterone acetate. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

All sample populations were small and confidence intervals were wide. In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in Ferriman-Galwey scores 12 months after the end of treatment in those women who received 100mg/day spironolactone compared to 12.5 mg/day cyproterone acetate (first 10 days of cycle) (WMD -1.18, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.26) and 5mg/day finasteride (WMD -2.34, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.45).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Six months treatment with 100 mg/day spironolactone compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant subjective improvement in hair growth and a decrease in Ferriman-Galwey scores. Spironolactone 100mg/day is superior to finasteride 5 mg/day and low dose cyproterone acetate 12.5 mg/day (first 10 days of cycle) up to 12 months after the end of treatment. The effectiveness of treatment for acne vulgaris cannot be determined due to the small sample populations involved in the trials. Its value in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research.

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^9819cf89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.

Objectives

Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality, morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to determine if there is a blood-pressure lowering dose response with spironolactone.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95%CI:16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95%CI:4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. There may be a dose response effect with spironolactone up to 50 mg/day, but the confidence intervals around the mean end-of-study blood pressure for doses ranging 25–500 mg/day all overlapped. In other words, it appears that doses > 50mg/day do not produce further reductions in either SBP or DBP. One cross-over study found that spironolactone 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly change SBP or DBP compared to placebo, SBP: -9.9 (95%CI:-21.15,1.35); DBP -2.34 (95%CI:-7.92,3.06).

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited available evidence, spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary (essential) hypertension when doses of 100–500 mg/day are given. A dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, compared to placebo. Given the lack of a dose-response, coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses, doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. There is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.

Data

Animal Data

Teratology studies with ALDACTONE have been carried out in mice and rabbits at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day. On a body surface area basis, this dose in the mouse is substantially below the maximum recommended human dose and, in the rabbit, approximates the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic or other embryotoxic effects were observed in mice, but the 20 mg/kg dose caused an increased rate of resorption and a lower number of live fetuses in rabbits. Because of its antiandrogenic activity and the requirement of testosterone for male morphogenesis, ALDACTONE may have the potential for adversely affecting sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis. When administered to rats at 200 mg/kg/day between gestation days 13 and 21 (late embryogenesis and fetal development), feminization of male fetuses was observed. Offspring exposed during late pregnancy to 50 and 100 mg/kg/day doses of ALDACTONE exhibited changes in the reproductive tract including dose-dependent decreases in weights of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicle in males, ovaries and uteri that were enlarged in females, and other indications of endocrine dysfunction, that persisted into adulthood. ALDACTONE has known endocrine effects in animals including progestational and antiandrogenic effects.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Spironolactone is not present in breastmilk; however, limited data from a lactating woman at 17 days postpartum reports the presence of the active metabolite, canrenone, in human breast milk in low amounts that are expected to be clinically inconsequential. In this case, there were no adverse effects reported for the breastfed infant after short term exposure to spironolactone; however, long term effects on a breastfed infant are unknown. There are no data on spironolactone effects on milk production. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for spironolactone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from spironolactone or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

ALDACTONE is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor renal function.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^341b2fb9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — medical therapy for hirsutism highlights that no combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that antiandrogens are used empirically with important cautions. No combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hirsutism; observational or nonrandomized studies note improvement but no studies of adequate power confirm benefit, few comparative studies exist, and no one type has been shown superior; oral contraceptives may have additive benefit when combined with other modalities, most commonly spironolactone, and if a pill contains drospirenone it may be necessary to reduce the dose of spironolactone and evaluate potassium levels. None of the antiandrogen agents were developed to treat hyperandrogenism in women or are FDA-approved; a meta-analysis could only include 12 out of 348 eligible trials and found these agents are mildly effective; as a class they are teratogenic with a risk of feminization of the external genitalia in a male fetus, so they are frequently used with oral contraceptives. Spironolactone usual dosage is 25–100 mg, twice a day; a full clinical effect may take 6 months or more; approximately 20% of women will experience increased menstrual frequency; it should be used cautiously in women with renal impairment; and rarely exposure has resulted in ambiguous genitalia in male infants. Flutamide common dosage is 125–250 mg/d; the risk of teratogenicity is significant and contraception should be used; it has been combined with lifestyle and metformin therapy for PCOS and may have additive effects. Finasteride inhibits both forms of 5-α-reductase and is available as a 5-mg tablet for prostate cancer and a 1-mg tablet for male alopecia.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^a64e22c1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin

The oral retinoid isotretinoin is used for treating severe acne. It was originally marketed under the brand name Roaccutane. The MHRA licensed indication for isotretinoin is for severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne, or acne that is at risk of permanent scarring) that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy. The licence states that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. The MHRA has defined the groups of healthcare professionals who can take the role of Lead Prescriber in making the decision to initiate isotretinoin treatment following a face-to-face assessment with the patient.

Acne conglobate (severe nodular cystic acne) and acne fulminans (acne conglobate with systemic symptoms) require urgent specialist dermatology review and potentially earlier treatment with isotretinoin. Otherwise, it is first necessary to follow the stepwise management of acne recommended in the NICE guidance.

Isotretinoin is an effective treatment for severe acne. There are a number of known and potential adverse effects associated with treatment. Most people will experience dryness of the skin and lips, which can be helped by emollients and lip balm, and a flare in acne is common at the start of treatment. Both of these adverse effects are dose dependent. Blood abnormalities are reasonably common, but in healthy people are usually not serious.

Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic, and therefore, pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and for 1 month after stopping. All people with childbearing potential (people who may be able to become pregnant) must be entered into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP).

Prescribers:

To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points:

- I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin.

- I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy.

- I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling, or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer.

- I will comply with the iPLEDGE REM requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide.

- Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin, and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy.

### Developing a systematic approach to safer medication use during pregnancy: summary of a centers for disease control and prevention – convened meeting [^4dadc643]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

To address information gaps that limit informed clinical decisions on medication use in pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) solicited expert input on a draft prototype outlining a systematic approach to evaluating the quality and strength of existing evidence for associated risks. The draft prototype outlined a process for the systematic review of available evidence and deliberations by a panel of experts to inform clinical decision making for managing health conditions in pregnancy. At an expert meeting convened by the CDC in January 2013, participants divided into working groups discussed decision points within the prototype. This report summarizes their discussions of best practices for formulating an expert review process, developing evidence summaries and treatment guidance, and disseminating information. There is clear recognition of current knowledge gaps and a strong collaboration of federal partners, academic experts, and professional organizations willing to work together toward safer medication use during pregnancy.

9 CONTRACEPTION CONSIDERATIONS OF LONG‐TERM SYSTEMIC RETINOID USE

Systemic retinoids are known teratogens, with a "black box" warning of extreme risk to the exposed fetus for severe birth defects. Adolescents of childbearing potential taking systemic retinoids should be counseled about their options for contraception, inclusive of highly effective methods such as intrauterine devices (levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system, intrauterine copper contraceptive) and subcutaneous injection (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) and implants (etonogestrel‐releasing contraceptive implants). The failure rates of these long‐acting reversible contraceptives are less than 1%. 122 In the United States, all patients of childbearing potential on isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE program contraceptive regulations; specifically, those who are sexually active must use two forms of contraception, including one highly effective form, while on isotretinoin. Acitretin does not have a mandated risk management program, but contraceptive counseling should be as rigorous as for isotretinoin and include long‐term contraceptive planning, given the prolonged half‐life of the drug. The acitretin package insert also states that two forms of contraception are required. Teratogenicity resulting from male retinoid use has not been reported. Table 12 summarizes the pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids.

Table 12
Pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids

While isotretinoin is cleared within several months, acitretin has a much longer half‐life. In addition, acitretin taken with ethanol converts to etretinate, which is stored in fat and has a prolonged elimination and release into circulation. 123 Therefore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 years after cessation of acitretin therapy. When choosing a systemic retinoid for treatment of DOC, isotretinoin should be considered preferentially for patients of reproductive potential. In addition, because of the prolonged half‐life of acitretin, clinicians should consider transitioning patients of childbearing potential from acitretin to isotretinoin at the onset of puberty or at least consider long‐acting, reversible forms of contraception.

In adolescent patients continuing on a systemic retinoid from childhood, or those just starting a systemic retinoid with abstinence as the chosen form of contraception, discussions regarding contraception should be undertaken early and reviewed each visit. Providers, in shared decision‐making with patients, should have a plan to start contraception either at a specific age (eg, 16 years of age) or before sexual debut, employing the assistance of a gynecologist or other provider with expertise in contraception as needed.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^c28cdebc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the somewhat limited evidence available, some tentative conclusions can still be drawn. First, at a daily dose of 200 mg, spironolactone was found to be significantly superior to placebo versus inflamed lesions in a crossover trial in which 21 of 29 women completed 3 months of treatment. Baseline imbalance and a possible carryover effect of spironolactone into the second phase would have reduced the magnitude of the difference in efficacy between spironolactone and placebo, which was already large. This statistically significant result was not reported by the authors of a frequently cited Cochrane review, which evaluated the effects of spironolactone for hirsutism and acne. Equally, the Cochrane review may have also inadvertently misled authors of subsequent reports by stating that "there was no evidence for effectiveness [of spironolactone] for the treatment of acne vulgaris". In contrast to the crossover trial, no conclusions can be drawn from the two parallel group comparisons versus placebo regarding the absolute efficacy of lower doses of spironolactone. Spironolactone appeared to be more effective than placebo, but by how much was not quantified and indeed the difference may not have been clinically significant. The very-low-quality evidence provided by the case series consistently shows that lower doses do have a measure of anti-acne activity, but they contributed no information on relative efficacy.

The trials that assessed comparative efficacy versus the anti-androgens flutamide, finasteride, cimetidine, ketoconazole and various COCs consistently found no difference between the spironolactone arm and the anti-androgen arm. With the exception of the COCs for which anti-acne efficacy has been established beyond doubt, independent verification of the efficacy of the comparators is scarce and/or contradictory. What these anti-androgens have in common with spironolactone and COCs is the expectation that they will reduce sebum secretion at the doses used via their effects on androgen synthesis, action or sequestration (see Table 5). Demonstrating no difference in efficacy versus these agents is unhelpful in terms of quantifying the effect size for spironolactone, especially as some of the trials most likely had too few participants to detect a significant difference, if in fact such a difference existed.

### The management of acne vulgaris in pregnancy [^4f081a53]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common condition in adolescence and also for many women of childbearing age. The management of acne in pregnancy is complicated by the lack of clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in this patient population and safety concerns regarding retinoid use in pregnancy. Of primary concern to both patients and clinicians is the safety profile of medications used during pregnancy. This review seeks to clarify what management options are available to treat acne during pregnancy and what data are available to guide decision making. Topical treatments are considered the safest option during pregnancy. They have the best safety profile and minimize the levels of systemic absorption, and therefore the least risk of fetal exposure. If these are applied properly with a strong emphasis on adherence, excellent results can be achieved.

a Inhibition of steroidogenesis in the adrenals, ovaries and/or peripheral tissues, including skin, reduces serum levels of androgens and androgen precursors

Four of the RCTs evaluated spironolactone in combination with a COC. Hirsutism or PCOS was the primary diagnosis and acne was the secondary diagnosis. Since COCs are potent anti-androgens, and are effective as monotherapy for acne, superiority of the combination needs to be demonstrated over the COC alone. Despite this, only one trial included a COC monotherapy arm and found no benefit of adding spironolactone to norgestimate/EE, although, at trend, the combination was more effective. In this three-arm trial, treatment allocation was unbalanced, with three times as many women in the combination arm as those receiving COC monotherapy. Any added benefit of spironolactone might have been revealed had treatment arms been of equal size.

One potentially more useful trial put spironolactone head-to-head against oral tetracycline and found no difference in efficacy over 8 weeks of treatment; however, caution is necessary in interpreting the results as this trial was also unbalanced, with 63 women receiving spironolactone but only 14 receiving tetracycline. Interestingly, the duration of therapy was consistently short (2–3 months) for those RCTs in which acne was the primary diagnosis, and much longer (9–12 months) for the trials in which hirsutism was the primary diagnosis. After only 3 months of treatment, the response of acne to spironolactone may not be optimal. The case series show that clinicians often use longer courses to manage acne in the real world. Using the PP population, improvement rates were significantly higher in the case series compared with those RCTs that had also used an outcome measure that could be dichotomized. This difference in efficacy rates may be an indication that longer treatment is likely to be more successful.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Rat embryofetal studies report feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed to spironolactone in utero. Limited available data from published case reports and case series did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with spironolactone. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with heart failure, cirrhosis and poorly controlled hypertension during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Because of the potential risk to the male fetus due to anti-androgenic properties of spironolactone and animal data, avoid spironolactone in pregnant women or advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a male fetus.

The estimated background risk of major congenital anomalies and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major congenital anomalies and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Clinical classification of heart disease may worsen with pregnancy and lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Clinical classification of heart disease may worsen with pregnancy and lead to maternal death. Closely monitor pregnant patients for destabilization of their heart failure.

Pregnant women with symptomatic cirrhosis generally have poor outcomes including hepatic failure, variceal hemorrhage, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction and maternal death. Outcomes are worse with coexisting esophageal varices. Pregnant women with cirrhosis of the liver should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death.

### Compliance with pregnancy prevention programmes of isotretinoin in Europe: a systematic review [^19c57c91]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Most of the publications on isotretinoin, pregnancy and compliance with the pregnancy prevention programme (PPP) originate from North America. Information specific for the European situation is very limited. The aim of this study was to identify publications describing the use of isotretinoin in humans and the compliance with the PPP in Europe, a systematic search in Medline and Embase was conducted using the terms 'isotretinoin, pregnancy (and Europe)'. Furthermore, a manual search in publications was performed. A total of 17 publications were identified. Publications consisted of case reports of exposed pregnancies, surveys among dermatologists or pharmacists and database studies evaluating compliance with the PPP. The studies and surveys dealt with groups of patients exposed to isotretinoin before or during pregnancy and/or compliance with the isotretinoin PPP. Where the information was provided, in 6–26% of cases isotretinoin was prescribed in full accordance with the PPP. Pregnancy incidence was seen in 0·2–1·0 per 1000 women of childbearing age using isotretinoin. Between 65% and 87% of these pregnancies were terminated. This review of studies in Europe performed to date shows failures in the implementation of the PPP. Therefore, the isotretinoin PPP must be scrutinized to identify whether new measures should be taken or whether the failures in the implementation need to be corrected. New measures should take into account the definition of the ultimate goal of a PPP and the acceptable burden. In the meantime, stakeholders could make a start with adjustments in the implementation of the PPP by taking responsibility and enhancing the performance by explicit instructions, monitoring the performance and adjusting, if necessary.

### Trends in the proportion of young women and girls prescribed spironolactone [^97321e33]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We estimate 1.2% of insured young women and girls initiated spironolactone, with this proportion rising considerably in recent years. Consistent with prior studies, many prescriptions were associated with acne. However, this condition represented only a portion of total use. Most initiators had androgen-related conditions, indications frequently requiring higher doses than those examined in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease. Limitations of this analysis included potential misclassification of indication, as some diagnoses are more likely to be recorded due to better insurance reimbursement. Nonetheless, we expect minimal misclassification across cardiovascular and androgen-related categories. A total of 29.4% lacked a diagnosis for the examined conditions; these patients may have been prescribed spironolactone to manage ascites and edema-related symptoms during cancer treatment, an indication that could not be incorporated without cancer registry linkage. Despite these limitations, our findings indicate spironolactone among young women and girls is notable and growing, with the great majority having indications requiring higher doses than those examined in trials. Further investment in safety studies may be warranted.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure during or 1 month after isotretinoin therapy immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch telephone number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com).

Risk Summary

Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy because isotretinoin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient. There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and premature births following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy in humans. If isotretinoin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. If pregnancy occurs during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

Data

Human Data

Major congenital malformations that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include malformations of the face, eyes, ears, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. External malformations include: skull; ear (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Internal abnormalities include: CNS (including cerebral and cerebellar malformations, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular; thymus gland; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred as a result of the malformations.

Cases of IQ scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported in children exposed in utero to isotretinoin. An increased risk of spontaneous abortion and premature births have been reported with isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of isotretinoin in either animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from isotretinoin, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with isotretinoin, and for at least 8 days after the last dose of isotretinoin.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^e35c68a8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Generalized psoriasis — female of childbearing potential — acitretin risk and dosing considerations are outlined, with plaques involving 35% of her body surface area. Because "there are no safe levels for oral retinoids in the face of pregnancy, the FDA has placed a 3-year postdosing moratorium on pregnancy with acitretin", and "female patients of childbearing potential should never receive oral acitretin". Reported laboratory abnormalities with acitretin include "up to 16%" transaminase elevations and "between 25% and 50%" triglyceride elevations. For monotherapy efficacy, the authors state acitretin may need "doses exceeding 25 mg/d to obtain significant improvement". The discussion also notes that "systemic isotretinoin has a much shorter half-life than acitretin" with "safe and relatively effective use in female psoriasis patients of childbearing potential" reported.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^a6a72265]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle management is recommended as the first-line treatment option for PCOS. However, in some circumstances where lifestyle management is unsuccessful, pharmacological agents including the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), anti-obesity agents, metformin, and anti-androgen medications, could be employed for clinical management. The COCP is often prescribed for adult women with PCOS, for management of irregular menses and clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism and acne). Similarly, COCPs are recommended for adolescent girls diagnosed with PCOS and those considered to be "at risk for PCOS". Metformin has been used for ovulation induction, promotion of weight loss and/or maintenance, and reduction of pregnancy complications.

Anti-androgen medications such as spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, and cyproterone acetate (CPA) have been utilised to decrease hyperandrogenism-related symptoms. Anti-androgen medications act in one of three ways; either by competitively inhibiting the androgen-binding receptors; decreasing androgen production (although the manner in which this occurs is not well-understood); or inhibiting 5-α-reductase in the skin, which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into its active form, 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Spironolactone and finasteride are dose-dependent competitive inhibitors of the androgen receptor and have also been observed to inhibit 5-α-reductase activity. Other anti-androgens such as CPA, flutamide, and bicalutamide are thought to competitively inhibit testosterone binding to the androgen receptor. Via these mechanisms, anti-androgen medications could ameliorate the hyperandrogenic state of PCOS and improve the various hyperandrogenism-related symptoms associated with the condition.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^2e43f3df]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — spironolactone safety and potassium monitoring: Common side effects include diuresis (29%), menstrual irregularities (22%), and breast tenderness (17%), and non–clinically relevant potassium elevations may occur in about 13.7% of patients; in 967 women aged 18 to 45 years taking 50 to 200 mg daily, only 0.75% of 1723 potassium measurements exceeded 5.0 mmol/L and 6 of the 13 abnormal tests were normal on repeat; serum potassium testing is therefore not required, but should be considered in older patients and in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or digoxin, with measurements performed at baseline, during therapy, and after dose increases; patients should also be educated to avoid foods high in dietary potassium such as low-sodium processed foods and coconut water; spironolactone may be used safely with drospirenone-containing COCs, with no elevations in serum potassium in a series of 27 patients receiving spironolactone 100 mg daily plus ethinyl estradiol 30 μg/drospirenone 3 mg.

### Oral isotretinoin: new developments relevant to clinical practice [^153f0af4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Oral isotretinoin is unrivalled in efficacy and remission capability for treatment of acne. In addition to appropriate monitoring and continued vigilance for safety concerns, appropriate dosing to mitigate avoidable dose-dependent adverse effects is the responsibility of prescribers. Low-dose regimens are better tolerated and effective in inducing acne clearance. Although much progress has been made since the advent of isotretinoin, there remain many unanswered questions regarding optimization to maximize response while minimizing the potential for avoidable adverse events. The ongoing availability of isotretinoin is imperative to patients with acne, their caregivers, and physicians.

Prescribers

To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be enrolled and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can enroll by signing and returning the completed enrollment form. Prescribers can only activate their enrollment by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points:

I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin.
I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy.
I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling, or I will refer the patient to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer.
I will comply with the iPLEDGE REMS requirements described in the booklet entitled iPLEDGE REMS Prescriber Guide.
Before beginning treatment of patients who can become pregnant with isotretinoin and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin treatment, during isotretinoin treatment and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin treatment, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy.
I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any patient who can become pregnant until verifying the patient has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin and another pregnancy test one month later.
I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the patient who can become pregnant is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry.

### Severe hypokalaemia in primary aldosteronism during pregnancy [^62afb885]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is rarely seen in pregnancy despite being a common cause of secondary hypertension. Spironolactone, the first-line treatment, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential anti-androgenic effects; treatment options are thus limited. We present a case in which severe hypokalaemia associated with PA was discovered during pregnancy. Eplerenone was used as a short-term treatment without adverse effects to the fetus before unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in the second trimester after the patient was refractory to medical treatment. This case report adds to the limited literature on management of PA in pregnancy, which could influence future risk-benefit discussions regarding surgical versus medical management of this condition.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^df95bbbf]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy and lactation — heart failure medication counseling notes that in 2015 the FDA adopted the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule retiring categories A through X and providing a descriptive risk summary; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are associated with multiple second- and third-trimester fetal harms and are, therefore, strictly contraindicated, and there are no specific data for ARNI or ivabradine. For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, spironolactone has dose-dependent feminization findings in animal offspring with limited data for eplerenone. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) medications considered acceptable during pregnancy within multidisciplinary shared decision-making include furosemide, beta blockers (most commonly metoprolol), hydralazine, and nitrates. Regarding lactation, breastfeeding may be associated with LV recovery; postpartum women who breastfeed can start ACEi (enalapril or captopril preferred), metoprolol remains the preferred beta blocker, and a medication safety resource is available via LactMed.
