## Question

Asthma exacerbation indecattion of admission

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for hospital admission in asthma exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including ED versus outpatient settings and age groups. Then, I should verify the objective severity thresholds based on lung function and oxygenation. Next, I will review clinical severity features and risk factors that modify disposition. After that, I need to check the timing of reassessment and how response to therapy changes disposition. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight special populations and documentation requirements, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't miss anything important. This question centers on ED disposition decisions for asthma exacerbations, with extensions to primary care and inpatient contexts, and it must cover adults, adolescents, and children, including preschoolers, because thresholds and transfer criteria differ by age and setting [^95315a0d] [^e89a5341].

> I will now examine objective severity thresholds, since these drive admission decisions most reliably. Wait, let me verify the exact cut points: GINA recommends hospitalization if pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF is less than 25% predicted or personal best, or if post-treatment FEV1 or PEF remains less than 40% predicted or personal best; discharge is reasonable when post-treatment lung function is 40–60% predicted if risk factors are low and follow-up is assured, and discharge is recommended when post-treatment lung function exceeds 60% predicted or personal best after considering risk and follow-up availability [^95315a0d] [^669e596a]. Hold on, I should also confirm oxygenation thresholds: in pediatrics, SpO2 less than 92% on room air is associated with high morbidity and likely need for hospitalization, whereas SpO2 less than 90% signals the need for aggressive therapy in children and adults; in adults, targeting 93–95% saturation during acute care is reasonable while avoiding hyperoxia [^e89a5341] [^f287ff33] [^3a7bcd04].

> Next, I should review clinical severity features that, even without formal spirometry, push toward admission. Let me think about red flags: inability to speak in full sentences, accessory muscle use, paradoxical pulse, cyanosis, agitation or drowsiness, and a silent chest indicate severe or life-threatening disease and warrant immediate transfer to higher acuity care; in children, inability to speak or drink, marked tachypnea, and chest retractions carry the same implication [^5d6cd62d] [^e89a5341]. I should double-check that these align with guideline language, and yes, GINA explicitly lists these as features mandating urgent transfer and ICU-level care when present [^5d6cd62d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disposition based on a single assessment. I need to ensure we incorporate response to therapy and timing of reassessment. GINA advises reassessing clinical status and measuring lung function about 1 hour after initial treatment, because post-treatment severity better predicts admission and ICU transfer than arrival severity; patients with little or no response or ongoing deterioration should be admitted or transferred, whereas those with substantial improvement and adequate lung function may be discharged with close follow-up [^669e596a] [^a39b7f7e]. Let me verify that this applies across ages; yes, the principle is consistent, with pediatric-specific observation windows and escalation triggers embedded in GINA's pediatric sections [^e89a5341].

> I should confirm which patient-specific risk factors modify disposition even when lung function is borderline. Female sex, older age, non-White race, prior severe exacerbations, ICU admission or intubation, frequent ED visits or oral steroid bursts, poor adherence, and limited social support increase the likelihood of admission; conversely, reliable follow-up and good inhaler technique mitigate risk and may allow discharge at lower lung function thresholds [^95315a0d] [^2cc876c3] [^0e1902be]. But wait, what if the patient has poor perception of airflow limitation? GINA notes that some patients, particularly males with a history of near-fatal asthma, may have poor symptom perception, so objective measures and a lower threshold for admission are prudent in that subgroup [^350ec9b6].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overlook age-specific triggers for admission. In children 5 years and younger, immediate transfer is indicated for SpO2 less than 92%, respiratory rate greater than 40 per minute, inability to speak or drink, cyanosis, or silent chest; lack of response to 6 puffs of salbutamol over 1–2 hours or recurrence within 48 hours also mandates hospitalization, and social factors such as caregiver inability to manage at home further lower the threshold for admission [^e89a5341] [^5c90d4c1]. I should double-check that these pediatric thresholds are consistent with GINA 2025, and they are, including the emphasis on close observation after initial therapy and clear escalation criteria [^e89a5341].

> Next, I should review the role of adjunctive therapies and diagnostics that influence disposition and safety. Early systemic corticosteroids are recommended for essentially all but the mildest exacerbations to hasten recovery and reduce relapse; in severe cases, add ipratropium and consider intravenous magnesium, which reduce hospitalizations in adults and children; do not routinely obtain chest radiography or antibiotics unless there is suspicion of alternative pathology or infection, and avoid routine leukotriene antagonists in the acute setting [^04b03156] [^ffe4805f] [^f93be9ed] [^5d6cd62d] [^e5307e4b] [^fd0dfd63]. Wait, I initially thought to include a blanket statement about noninvasive ventilation, but I should correct that: evidence for NIV in acute asthma is limited and mixed, so NIV should be reserved for selected cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure with close monitoring rather than routine use [^7aa40035].

> I need to ensure the discharge readiness criteria are explicit and actionable. Discharge is appropriate when the patient is clinically stable, able to ambulate without significant dyspnea, has post-treatment FEV1 or PEF at least 60% predicted or personal best, SpO2 at least 92–95% on room air, and demonstrates reliable inhaler technique; a short course of oral steroids, continuation or initiation of ICS-containing controller therapy, and a written action plan with follow-up within 2–7 days are essential to reduce relapse risk [^95315a0d] [^0953331a] [^10445ef5]. Hold on, I should verify that SABA-only discharge is discouraged; yes, GINA explicitly recommends against SABA-only treatment after discharge due to increased risk of relapse and poor outcomes, reinforcing the need for ICS-containing maintenance therapy [^c0664696].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, but I will keep checking it against the evidence as I go. Admission is indicated for any life-threatening feature, pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF less than 25% predicted, or post-treatment FEV1 or PEF less than 40% predicted; it is also indicated for post-treatment values 40–60% predicted when risk factors are present or follow-up is uncertain, and for inadequate response to therapy after about 1 hour despite appropriate bronchodilators and corticosteroids; discharge is reasonable when post-treatment lung function exceeds 60% predicted, symptoms have resolved, oxygenation is adequate, and reliable follow-up is assured, with lower thresholds acceptable if risk is low and social supports are strong [^95315a0d] [^669e596a]. I should confirm that this aligns with GINA's disposition algorithm, and it does, including the emphasis on serial reassessment and individualized risk integration [^669e596a].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and follow-up elements that reduce readmissions and improve safety. Record pre- and post-treatment lung function, oxygen saturation, clinical severity features, risk factors, and the rationale for admission or discharge; provide a written asthma action plan, reinforce inhaler technique, arrange follow-up within 2–7 days, and communicate with the primary care provider; consider referral to asthma specialty care for patients with repeated ED visits, hospitalizations, or persistent poor control despite adherence [^10445ef5] [^3b601924] [^0c177238]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps are associated with improved outcomes; yes, comprehensive discharge bundles and early follow-up reduce relapse and improve control, supporting their routine implementation [^3b601924].

Hospital admission for asthma exacerbation is indicated for **severe or life-threatening features** (e.g. oxygen saturation < 90%, altered consciousness, silent chest, or peak flow < 50% predicted) [^95315a0d] [^f287ff33], **poor response to initial therapy** (FEV1/PEF < 60% predicted after 1 hour) [^669e596a], or **high-risk patients** with prior ICU admission, intubation, or frequent ED visits [^0c177238]. Additional indications include **significant comorbidities** (e.g. pneumonia, pneumothorax, cardiac disease) [^ea1a8eb8], **social risk factors** (unreliable follow-up, poor adherence, living alone) [^3ed126d8], or **pediatric red flags** (respiratory rate > 40, SpO2 < 92%, inability to speak or feed, or poor response to bronchodilators) [^e89a5341]. Admission decisions should be individualized, integrating clinical judgment, response to therapy, and patient-specific risk factors [^3ed126d8].

---

## Clinical severity indicators

Several **clinical severity indicators** guide the decision to admit a patient with an asthma exacerbation:

- **Oxygen saturation (SpO2)**: SpO2 < 90% on room air is a strong indicator of severe asthma and warrants hospitalization [^f287ff33]. In pediatric patients, SpO2 < 92% is associated with high morbidity and likely need for hospitalization [^e89a5341].

- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)**: PEF or FEV1 < 50% of predicted or personal best indicates severe airflow obstruction and necessitates admission [^95315a0d]. Post-treatment PEF or FEV1 < 60% of predicted or personal best after 1 hour of therapy also indicates a need for hospitalization [^669e596a].

- **Respiratory rate and accessory muscle use**: Respiratory rate > 22 breaths per minute, accessory muscle use, or paradoxical respirations are signs of severe asthma requiring admission [^95315a0d].

- **Altered mental status**: Drowsiness, confusion, or altered consciousness indicates severe hypoxemia and imminent respiratory failure, necessitating immediate hospitalization [^5d6cd62d].

- **Silent chest**: A silent chest on auscultation indicates severe airway obstruction and imminent respiratory failure, requiring immediate admission [^5d6cd62d].

---

## Response to initial therapy

The patient's response to initial bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy is critical in determining the need for admission. Poor response — with **FEV1/PEF < 60% predicted** after 1 hour of therapy — indicates severe asthma and warrants hospitalization [^669e596a]. Lack of clinical improvement — persistent dyspnea, wheezing, or respiratory distress despite initial therapy — also indicates a need for admission [^5d6cd62d].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of **hospitalization**:

- **History of severe exacerbations**: Prior ICU admission, intubation, or mechanical ventilation significantly increases the risk of future severe exacerbations and necessitates admission [^0c177238].

- **Frequent ED visits or hospitalizations**: Patients with frequent ED visits or hospitalizations (> 2 per year) are at higher risk and often require admission [^0c177238].

- **Poor adherence to medication**: Non-adherence to controller medications increases the risk of severe exacerbations and hospitalization [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Presence of comorbid conditions such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, cardiac disease, or psychiatric disorders increases the risk of severe asthma and necessitates admission [^notfound].

---

## Social and environmental factors

Social and environmental factors also influence the decision to admit. Unreliable follow-up — limited access to healthcare, lack of transportation, or inability to arrange timely follow-up — supports admission [^3ed126d8]. Living alone or lacking caregiver support increases the risk of poor outcomes and may necessitate admission. Poor adherence to medication or inability to manage asthma at home likewise supports admission [^3ed126d8].

---

## Pediatric-specific indications

Children with asthma exacerbations have specific indications for **hospital admission**:

- **Respiratory rate**: > 40 breaths per minute in children aged 2–5 years [^e89a5341].

- **Oxygen saturation**: SpO2 < 92% on room air [^e89a5341].

- **Inability to speak or feed**: Due to respiratory distress [^e89a5341].

- **Poor response to bronchodilators**: Lack of improvement after initial bronchodilator therapy [^e89a5341].

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c0664696]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

Asthma exacerbations remain a leading cause of hospitalization in the pediatric population, and many children who require hospitalization for status asthmaticus are managed using clinical care pathways (CPGs). Clinical care pathways are often created or adopted by healthcare systems in order to establish specific, evidence-based guidelines that standardize and coordinate quality care in both the emergency room and inpatient settings. This paper reviews the use of these guidelines and the updated evidence-based recommendations regarding best-practice for acute asthma care of hospitalized children, including the 2020 recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel (NAEPP).

### Factors associated with hospital admission in adult patients with asthma exacerbations: a systematic review [^2cc876c3]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A variable proportion of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma require admission to hospital. Previous studies have identified select factors associated with admission following ED presentation; however, no review has synthesized the evidence in this regard. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding factors associated with hospital admission following ED presentation.

Methods

Searches were conducted in seven electronic databases and common sources of grey literature. Studies reporting disposition for adults after ED presentation were included. Admission proportions and factors associated with hospitalization that remained statistically significant in multivariable analyses (p < 0.05) were reported.

Results

Out of an initial 5865 identified articles, 15 articles met full inclusion criteria and 11 were included in the analyses. Female sex (n = 2) and older age (n = 2) were individual factors associated with admission. Patient vital signs and severity followed by patient attributes were the two most frequent domains associated with admission. Admission proportions were analyzed in 10 studies at an median of ∼20% with no clear change between 1996 and 2012.

Conclusions

Factors such as patient demographics (e.g., female sex, older age), patient vital signs/severity, and history are associated with admission following ED presentation for acute asthma. These can be employed by ED clinicians to effectively discern patients at high risk for admission and lead to more evidence-based decision-making.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Independent risk factors for death in patients admitted for asthma exacerbation in Taiwan [^d3c6de24]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma exacerbation, characterized by a progressive increase in asthmatic symptoms and a progressive decrease in lung function, accounts for a large proportion of the asthma health-care cost burden. Patients with severe asthma exacerbation may need emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospitalizations and require changes in asthma treatment. – Notably, the frequency of ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation is increasing among children, young adults, and the elderly. – For patients experiencing asthma exacerbation at ED arrival and on hospital admission, physicians' knowledge and recognition of mortality risk factors are critical to identifying patients who require additional treatment efforts. However, few studies focus on patients admitted for asthma exacerbation and investigate the independent factors to predict in-hospital mortality in this patient population. Although some epidemiologic predictors (e.g. comorbidities, sex, and age) are associated with mortality in patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation, the potentially preventable factors associated with mortality have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, physicians still face challenges in refining the overall management of asthma and in reducing mortality in patients admitted for asthma exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^95315a0d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — criteria for hospitalization versus discharge from the emergency department prioritize that clinical status and lung function 1 hour after treatment are more reliable predictors than arrival status, and provide spirometric thresholds and risk factors to guide decisions. Hospitalization is recommended if pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 25% predicted or personal best, or if post-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 40% predicted or personal best. Discharge may be possible when post-treatment lung function is 40–60% predicted after considering patient risk factors and availability of follow-up care, and discharge is recommended when post-treatment lung function is > 60% predicted or personal best after considering risk factors and follow-up care availability. Other factors associated with increased likelihood of admission include female sex, older age and non-white race; use of more than eight beta2 agonist puffs in the previous 24 hours; severity indicators such as respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation < 95%, and final PEF < 50% predicted; past history of severe exacerbations; and previous unscheduled office and emergency department visits requiring use of OCS.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^894ba4b5]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to prescribe ongoing ICS-containing treatment on discharge home to reduce the risk of asthma-related hospitalization and death.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^dcc3f188]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Refer for specialized investigations — indications for referral: Referral for expert advice and further diagnostic evaluation is advised for patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite treatment, for diagnostic uncertainty (especially if an alternative diagnosis needs to be investigated), for patients with suspected asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggesting an additional pulmonary diagnosis, when chronic airways disease is suspected but syndromic features of either asthma or COPD are few, and for patients with comorbidities that may interfere with assessment and management. When atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggest an additional pulmonary diagnosis, this should prompt early referral, without waiting for a trial of treatment for asthma or COPD. Referral may also be appropriate for issues arising during ongoing management of asthma, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, as outlined in the GINA and GOLD strategy reports.

### Discharge of the asthmatic patient [^e9cf8e91]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be a challenging disease to treat in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The growing database on therapeutic interventions at the time of transition from the acute to chronic phase of this disease is encouraging. Glucocorticoids and inhaled beta-agonists clearly reduce readmission and relapse. Other medications and educational interventions also appear effective. Still, no true discharge guidelines have been established. Multiple statements by consensus panels have recommended using FEV1 or PEFR as indicators of readiness for discharge, but this has not been prospectively validated from either the emergency department or inpatient setting. In contrast, some studies argue that pulmonary functions do not accurately predict relapse and readmission, so the usefulness of these discharge recommendations is debatable. Large studies, especially in the adult asthmatic population, are needed to validate these recommendation.

### A prospective multicenter study of factors associated with hospital admission among adults with acute asthma [^0e1902be]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine patient characteristics associated with hospital admission after emergency treatment for asthma, and whether disposition guidelines are followed.

Subjects and Methods

We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study involving 64 emergency departments in the United States and Canada. Consecutive adult patients with asthma exacerbations were interviewed, and their charts were reviewed using standardized protocols. Telephone follow-up at 2 weeks determined relapse.

Results

Of 1805 patients, 363 (20%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18% to 22%) were hospitalized. Among patients with severe exacerbations (final peak flow < 50% of predicted), 122 (49%; 95% CI: 43% to 55%) were hospitalized. Admission was associated with final peak flow, female sex, nonwhite race, severity of chronic illness, and severity of exacerbation. Admission predictors were similar regardless of hospital funding, region, or size. Among patients with mild or moderate exacerbations of asthma (peak flow ≥ 50% predicted), the likelihood of admission was associated significantly with the number of predefined risk factors for death from asthma. Of patients who were discharged from the emergency department, 62 (5%; 95% CI: 4% to 6%) relapsed within 72 hours. Relapse was not associated with final peak flow (P = 0.39).

Conclusion

Associations between patient characteristics and disposition were similar across sites. Despite guidelines to the contrary, half of patients with final peak flow < 50% were discharged. After emergency department treatment and discharge, short-term relapse was uncommon among patients with asthma, suggesting that strict peak flow cutoffs may be unnecessary if risk factors in patients with mild or moderate exacerbations are considered.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^9b863b55]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Identification of patterns of factors preceding severe or life-threatening asthma exacerbations in a nationwide study [^c8d50217]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Risk factors for incipient asthma exacerbation include sex, age, race, socioeconomic status, baseline lung function, smoking history, exposure to viruses, active sinusitis, and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. 1 Frequent asthma exacerbation is a risk factor associated with progression to severe disease and excessive decline in lung function. 2 Severe exacerbation is recognized as an indication for evaluating the required level of interventional asthma management to reduce the potential risk of death. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Using cluster analysis, many studies have described the heterogeneity of severe asthma symptoms during nonexacerbation periods. 1, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have reported on the heterogeneity of patient factors preceding worsening symptoms leading to severe or life‐threatening exacerbation in a real‐world setting.

Previous reports to date have relied on information extracted by physicians from limited medical histories and on information provided by relatives or friends of patients who died from severe asthma. 3, 4, 5 Other studies have shown that short‐acting beta‐agonist (SABA) usage was increased from around 5 days preceding emergency hospitalization. 13, 14 However, these previous data were from strictly controlled clinical trials with good compliance to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or ICS/long‐acting beta‐agonist (LABA) use, while in general clinical practice, variable asthma drug compliance and smoking habits prevail as confounding factors. To accurately predict and reduce exacerbation, it is necessary to determine the factors influencing the pattern of exacerbation in a real‐world setting and adjust management strategies for each patient accordingly.

We recently performed a nationwide, prospective, multicenter study in which patients admitted for severe or life‐threatening asthma were recruited at emergency hospitals throughout Japan. 15 The results demonstrated that significant heterogeneity exists among patients with severe or life‐threatening asthma exacerbation. We further estimated trajectories of asthma symptoms using k ‐means for longitudinal data in this study.

Inaccurate assessment of asthma severity often delays the provision of an appropriately intensive treatment, consequently leading to hospital admission or even death. In recent real‐world adult asthma studies, symptoms assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring have been proposed as potentially reliable tools for managing patients more effectively and for predicting uncontrolled asthma at home or the general practitioner's office. 16, 17, 18 To predict, prevent, and manage severe or life‐threatening asthma exacerbation, we herein assessed serial VAS scores from the 14 days before emergency hospitalization and sought to identify predictors of asthma worsening using cluster analysis.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^422389a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Factors associated with hospital admission among emergency department patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^2f002b96]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVES To determine the patient factors associated with hospital admission among adults who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to determine whether admissions were concordant with recommendations in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines.

Methods

The authors performed a prospective multicenter cohort study involving 29 EDs in the United States and Canada. By using a standard protocol, consecutive ED patients with COPD exacerbation were interviewed, and their charts were reviewed. Predictors of admission were determined by multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Of 384 patients, 233 (61%; 95% confidence interval = 56% to 66%) were admitted. Multivariate analysis showed that a higher likelihood of admission was associated with older age, female gender, more pack-years of smoking, recent use of inhaled corticosteroid, self-reported activity limitation in the past 24 hours, higher respiratory rate at ED presentation, and a concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients who reported the ED as their usual site for problem COPD care, or who had mixed COPD and asthma, were less likely to be admitted. The authors confirmed five of the seven testable indications for hospital admission in the GOLD guidelines.

Conclusions

Several patient factors were independently associated with hospital admission among ED patients with COPD exacerbations. Overall, concordance with admission recommendations in the GOLD guidelines was high. The authors also identified a few novel predictors of admission (female gender, ED as the usual site for problem COPD care, mixed diagnosis of COPD and asthma, recent use of inhaled corticosteroid) that require replication in future studies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0c177238]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — indications for considering referral for expert advice, where available, include scenarios of diagnostic uncertainty, suspected occupational asthma, persistent or severely uncontrolled disease, risk factors for asthma-related death, frequent systemic corticosteroid use, complications or sub-types, and pediatric considerations. When confirming diagnosis is difficult, indications include when a patient has symptoms of chronic infection or features suggesting a cardiac or other non-pulmonary cause, for which "immediate referral recommended," or when the diagnosis is unclear even after a trial of therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or systemic corticosteroids. For suspected occupational asthma, "Refer for confirmatory testing and identification of sensitizing or irritant agent, and specific advice about eliminating exposure and pharmacological treatment." Persistent or severely uncontrolled asthma or frequent exacerbations include when symptoms remain uncontrolled or lung function is low despite correct inhaler technique and good adherence with Step 4 treatment (medium-dose ICS-LABA), or when the patient frequently uses asthma-related health care (e.g., multiple ED visits or urgent primary care visits). Risk factors for asthma-related death include a near-fatal asthma attack (ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation for asthma) at any time in the past, or suspected or confirmed anaphylaxis or food allergy in a patient with asthma. Indications also include frequent courses of oral corticosteroids, e.g., "two or more courses a year." Symptoms suggesting complications or sub-types of asthma may prompt referral, e.g., aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Additional reasons for referral in children 6–11 years include symptoms or exacerbations that remain uncontrolled despite medium-dose ICS with correct inhaler technique and good adherence.

### The role of anticholinergics in acute asthma treatment: an evidence-based evaluation [^8aff2ead]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The role for anticholinergic medications in acute asthma is not well-defined. Thus, the use of therapy with anticholinergics and beta(2)-agonists, either simultaneously or in sequence, has produced positive as well as negative results in trials. Therefore, the current recommendations for the use of these drugs in the emergency department (ED) and hospital management of asthma exacerbations are not precise. This review answers the following question: what level of evidence is available in the literature to support the use of anticholinergic medications in combination with beta(2)-agonists in acute asthma patients? We limited the search on our therapy question to systematic reviews of randomized trials and/or randomized controlled trials not included in the reviews. After an extensive review of the most relevant evidence, the following conclusions may be emphasized. (1) The use of multiple doses of ipratropium bromide are indicated in the ED treatment of children and adults with severe acute asthma. The studies reported a substantial reduction in hospital admissions (30 to 60%; number needed to treat, 5 to 11) and significant differences in lung function favoring the combined treatment. No apparent increase in the occurrence of side effects was observed. (2) The use of single-dose protocols of ipratropium bromide with beta(2)-agonist treatment produced, particularly in children with more severe acute asthma, a modest improvement in pulmonary function without reduction in hospital admissions; in adults, the data showed a similar increase in pulmonary function with an approximately 35% reduction in the hospital admission rate. In patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma, there is no apparent benefit from adding a single dose of an anticholinergic medication.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7061f270]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium (as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes in adult and pediatric patients not responding to initial treatment and having persistent hypoxemia, and in pediatric patients whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care), to reduce hospital admissions, including in adult patients with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation.

### Focused assessment of patients with asthma in the emergency department [^64810606]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma remains a common cause for presentation to the emergency department. Multiple clinical asthma scores (CAS) have been developed to assess the severity of an asthma exacerbation. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine if adoption of a CAS and asthma guidelines identifies patients with more severe asthma and to identify factors that predict the need for hospital admission. The results identified the admission rates in the pre- and post-CAS groups to be similar. Within the post-CAS group, patients requiring admission received more aggressive therapy and were frequently hypoxic on initial presentation. In conclusion, CAS aids in identifying severe asthma exacerbations. Lack of response to aggressive therapy or hypoxia on initial presentation should prompt the emergency department physician to arrange for admission.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring during exacerbation treatment, and titrate treatment according to the response. Transfer patients immediately to an acute care facility when presenting with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation not responding to treatment or continuing to deteriorate. Obtain close monitoring in patients with little or slow response to short-acting β-agonists.

### The acute management of asthma [^a1cb226b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Asthma exacerbations. 5: assessment and management of severe asthma in adults in hospital [^5b04ac16]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge discrepancy between the management of severe asthma recommended by evidence-based guidelines and that observed in clinical practice. The recommendations are relatively straightforward and have been widely promoted both in guidelines and reviews. Specialist physicians need to be more proactive in their implementation of such guidelines through the use of locally derived protocols and assessment sheets, reinforced by audit. The common occurrence of severe asthma and its considerable burden to the community would support such an approach.

### Patient-and parent-initiated oral steroids for asthma exacerbations [^466462f7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways affecting an estimated 334 million people worldwide. During severe exacerbations, patients may need to attend a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with systemic corticosteroids, which can be administered intravenously or orally. Some people with asthma are prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCS) for self-administration (i.e. patient-initiated) or to administer to their child with asthma (i.e. parent-initiated), in the event of an exacerbation. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient- or parent-initiated oral steroids for adults and children with asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR from its inception to 18 May 2016 and trial registries from their inception to 24 August 2016; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data; we excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies where adults (aged 18 years or older) or children of school age (aged 5 years or older) with asthma were randomised to receive: (a) any patient-/parent-initiated OCS or (b) placebo, normal care, alternative active treatment, or an identical personalised asthma action plan without the patient- or parent-initiated OCS component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify any studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were hospital admissions for asthma, asthma symptoms at follow-up and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite comprehensive searches of electronic databases and clinical trial registries, we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Five potentially relevant studies were excluded for two reasons: the intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (three studies) and studies had a cross-over design (two studies). Two of the excluded studies asked the relevant clinical question. However, these studies were excluded due to their cross-over design, as per the protocol. We contacted the authors of the cross-over trials who were unable to provide data for the first treatment period (i.e. prior to cross-over).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials (non-cross-over design) to inform the use of patient- or parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in people with asthma.

### Final comments… [^15d2d90a]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The updated guideline moves away from a rigid categorization of disease and recognizes that identifying disease severity alone does not lead to optimal asthma management. The key elements of assessment and monitoring are refined to include the separate but related concepts of severity, control, and responsiveness to treatment. Classifying severity is emphasized for initiating therapy; assessing control is emphasized for monitoring and adjusting therapy. Asthma control is now weighted equally with asthma severity in determining appropriate therapy, with the recognition that asthma severity can change over time and is most readily recognized by ongoing care of asthma. In identifying disease severity, an exacerbation requiring oral systemic corticosteroids is the marker of risk. In assessing asthma control, risk not only includes the history of exacerbations, but also incorporates objective measurements of lung function and treatment-related adverse events.

Final decisions about severity or control classifications are guided by the most severe category in which any feature of impairment or risk occurs. CLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA SEVERITY Ideally, asthma severity is determined before initiating therapy. The EPR-3 guideline classification divides asthma severity into four groups: intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. "Mild-intermittent, " a classification in previous reports, has been eliminated. This term really only applies to mild disease, and not to patients with periods of moderate or severe exacerbation. CLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA CONTROL The guideline recommends that every patient with asthma be able to recognize symptoms that suggest inadequate asthma control. 4, 5 As with asthma severity, assessment of control is determined by current impairment and future risk.

The symptoms and history used to determine current impairment are the same as those used to determine impairment in evaluating disease severity, namely daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, frequent use of short-acting beta agonists for symptom relief, and inability to do normal activities because of symptoms. EXACERBATIONS One of the major differences from previous guidelines involves reinstating the 1991. 26 cut points of FEV 1 or PEF as criteria for discharge from the urgent care setting and identifying patients for whom response to therapy is incomplete and who usually require continued treatment or hospitalization. The limited value of pulmonary function measures in very severe exacerbations is acknowledged.

For home management of acute exacerbations, the EPR-3 report no longer recommends doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^da0a3408]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

Immediate transfer to hospital — children ≤ 5 years with asthma is indicated when any of the following are present: at assessment, child unable to speak or drink, cyanosis, "Respiratory rate > 40 per minute," "Oxygen saturation < 92% when breathing room air," or silent chest on auscultation; lack of response to initial bronchodilator treatment including "Lack of response to 6 puffs of inhaled salbutamol [albuterol] (2 separate puffs, repeated 3 times) over 1–2 hours" or "Persisting tachypnea* despite three administrations of inhaled SABA, even if the child shows other clinical signs of improvement"; or a "Social environment that limits delivery of acute treatment, or parent/caregiver unable to manage acute asthma at home." Additionally, "Children with features of a severe exacerbation that fail to resolve within 1–2 hours despite repeated dosing with inhaled SABA must be referred to hospital," other indications include "recurrence of signs of a severe exacerbation within 48 hours," and early attention should be sought for those "aged less than 2 years." During transfer, continue care with "inhaled SABA, oxygen (if available) to maintain saturation 94–98%, and give systemic corticosteroids."

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^10fc1cda]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^3210d746]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

### Out-of-hospital presentation and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the United States: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^27bf9628]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To describe the demographic, clinical, and emergency medical service (EMS) response characteristics associated with EMS activations for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in the US.

Methods

Using a nationwide set of out-of-hospital patient care report data from 2018 to 2019, we analyzed 9-1-1 EMS activations where asthma/COPD exacerbation was indicated by symptom, impression, or treatment provided. We excluded patients with ages less than 2 years or unknown, nonemergency transports, and encounters with any indication of anaphylaxis. Demographic, clinical, and EMS response characteristics were described for pediatric and adult patients with asthma/COPD exacerbations.

Results

A total of 1,336,988 asthma/COPD exacerbations were included, comprising 5% of qualifying 9-1-1 scene activations from 2018 to 2019. Most patients were adults (96%). Most adult patients were female (55%), whereas most pediatric patients were male (58%). Most activations occurred in urban settings (82%), particularly in pediatric patients (90%). Most asthma/COPD exacerbations were managed by advanced life support units (94%). Inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroid therapy were administered to 75% and 14% of all patients, respectively. Adults more often had oxygen saturation < 92% (43% vs 20% of pediatric patients) and were more often treated with assisted ventilation (9% vs 1%).

Conclusion

In this large nationwide sample of 9-1-1 activations treated and transported by EMS, 5% were for asthma/COPD exacerbation. Future work should focus on evidence-based standardization of EMS protocols and practice for asthma/COPD exacerbations to improve the quality of EMS care.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^9d4abb40]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Evaluation

Asthma and COPD exacerbations are clinical diagnoses without disease-specific confirmatory laboratory or radiographic findings. Thus, it is important to consider other diseases that can mimic or precipitate an exacerbation, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, heart failure, and myocardial infarction, as well as less common conditions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, or vocal cord dysfunction. Table 1,– outlines the initial evaluation of asthma and COPD exacerbations. Pulse oximetry is the primary method used to assess oxygenation, recognizing it may overestimate blood oxygen content among patients with darker skin tones, but an arterial blood gas assessment should be considered in select patients. – Sputum bacterial culture and viral pathogen testing are indicated in both asthma and COPD exacerbations, although bacterial culture results should be interpreted with caution because colonization can occur in both severe asthma and COPD.

Assessing Severity:

After confirming the diagnosis, a clinician should consider the severity of the exacerbation to guide management (Table 1). Severity of an asthma exacerbation is defined by changes in vital signs. Severity of COPD exacerbation was defined historically by the treatments used with severe disease requiring an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization; however, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report now recommends using objective data first outlined in the 2021 Rome Proposal that more closely mirrors severity grading of asthma exacerbations (Table 1). Major differences between the definitions of severe disease are the focus on peak expiratory flow and FEV 1 in asthma (severe disease being defined as a peak expiratory flow or FEV 1 of ≤ 40%–50% predicted or best measurement and life-threatening asthma as < 25%) and the incorporation of an elevated C-reactive protein level and acute hypercapnia in severe COPD exacerbations.

### Adherence with controller medication in adults with asthma-impact of hospital admission for acute exacerbation [^7dfe7cc6]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Uncontrolled asthma is associated with higher risk of hospital admissions and death. Low adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), the cornerstone of asthma therapy, is well-documented. Our aim was to investigate if hospital admission with an acute exacerbation of asthma changes ICS adherence.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study comprises 241 patients hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation over 12months (May 2019-April 2020). The primary outcome was proportion of ICS adherent patients, defined as Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) ≥ 80%, in the six-month period before and after admission.

Results

The pre- to post-admission proportion of ICS adherent patients increased from 10% to 13% (p = 0.25) and the mean ICS MPR increased from 34% to 42% (p < 0.001). Different patterns of post-discharge adherence were observed, as adherent patients remained adherent, while patients with poor pre-admission adherence increased their adherence during two months after discharge followed by a decline in MPR. Co-variates such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), GINA 2020-treatment step did not predict improvement in adherence after discharge.

Conclusions

Admission with an asthma exacerbation did not increase the proportion of patients adherent with controller medication, primarily ICS. Although an improvement in adherence was initially seen primarily in previously poorly adherent patients, this increase was transient as it decreased over time post-discharge.

### Early discharge of patients hospitalized with acute asthma: a controlled study [^06c3df84]. Respiratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the optimal length of stay and timing of release from hospital in patients admitted with acute asthma. We hypothesize that it might be safe to discharge patients from hospital once they have responded clinically to intensive anti-asthma treatment. In a non-randomized prospective controlled study, we compared two discharge protocols in consecutive patients admitted for acute severe exacerbations of bronchial asthma. Patients in group A were discharged after remission of signs and symptoms and those in group B after improvement but before complete remission of signs and symptoms. Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) were monitored but were not used as discharge criteria for either group. Patients with complicating disease and who were likely to be non-compliant were excluded. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and best PEFR at discharge were significantly lower in group B (87 admissions) than group A (80 admissions). The mean (± SD) LOS was 1.8(± 1) days vs. 3.5(± 1.4) days and best PEFR was 58(± 17)% predicted versus 71(± 15)% predicted respectively (P < 0.001 for both variables). No patient in either group relapsed within 4 weeks of discharge from hospital. We concluded that the release of asthmatics who respond promptly to intensive treatment and are compliant with medication despite incomplete resolution of symptoms, signs and PEFR at the time of discharge from hospital may not be associated with increased risk of early relapse.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^3b601924]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

The condition is responsible for substantial morbidity with 11% of children in the United Kingdom describing recurrent episodes of wheeze, and resulting in days lost from school and time lost from work for their parents/carers. Although in the United Kingdom, most school-age children with asthma are managed in primary care, each year there are in excess of 25,000 hospital admissions for children under the age of 14 years. Of the 195 asthma deaths investigated by the National Review of Asthma Deaths, 10 were in children under the age of 10 years.

The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Task Force defines exacerbations (or asthma 'attacks') as events characterised by a change from the patient's previous status, which may be severe (necessitating urgent action such as a course of steroids and/or hospitalisation) or moderate (prompting a temporary change of treatment). Many definitions include a fall in peak flow (e.g. to 50% or 75% of the patient's best) though this may not be helpful in younger children or those unfamiliar with undertaking the manoeuvre, and may be indicative of poor asthma control rather than exacerbation. Frequent exacerbations in children not only have an impact on quality of life and school attendance but are also associated with an accelerated loss of lung function.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^62f83440]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the most common obstructive lung diseases, account for more than one million hospitalizations and nearly six million hospital days each year in the US alone. Readmission rates at 30 days, following hospitalization for asthma and COPD exacerbations, are approximately 10% and 20%, respectively. Readmission rates at 90-days in patients with COPD exacerbations are estimated to be about 35%. In-hospital mortality for patients admitted with asthma or COPD exacerbations ranges from 0.2% to 38%; higher mortality rates correspond to populations with a greater acuity of illness, including those requiring mechanical ventilation. The economic burden from these hospitalizations and re-admissions is enormous; annual direct costs are estimated to be $16 billion, representing more than 30% of the total medical care costs for these two conditions.

Studies performed using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, (ICD-9) billing codes or physician-documented diagnosis to identify the study population, indicate that up to 50% of patients hospitalized with asthma or COPD exacerbations do not receive guideline recommended care. In a previous study using chart abstraction, we found that relying on ICD-9 billing codes may lead to overdiagnosis of COPD exacerbations in up to 25% of patients, potentially because confirmatory testing (e.g. spirometry) to document obstructive lung disease is rarely performed. To our knowledge, similar data on asthma exacerbations is not available. Objective measurement of expiratory airflow obstruction is considered essential to the diagnosis of asthma and COPD, as other diseases can present with similar symptoms. A recently completed audit of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations found substantial variations in care, with spirometry prior to hospital admissions available in only about three-quarters of patients. While confirmatory spirometry is recommended by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines to establish a diagnosis of asthma or COPD, is not routinely performed during hospitalizations for exacerbations, due to concerns about its feasibility (e.g. inadequate test quality) and a lack of data supporting its utility.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^841bdc93]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation terminology — the academic term 'exacerbation' is commonly used in scientific and clinical literature, although hospital-based studies more often refer to 'acute severe asthma'; however, the term 'exacerbation' is not suitable for use in clinical practice as it is difficult for many patients to pronounce and remember; the term 'flare-up' is simpler and conveys the sense that asthma is present even when symptoms are absent; the term 'attack' is used by many patients and healthcare providers but with widely varying meanings and may not be perceived as including gradual worsening; and in pediatric literature the term 'episode' is commonly used, but understanding of this term by parent/caregivers is not known.

### Gaining insights into asthma-related COVID-19 risk [^e95aee4c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rates of admission to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19 were increased among patients with asthma over those in the general population. However, this increase was of the same magnitude as the historic increase in influenza- and pneumonia-related hospitalizations among those with asthma.

When assessing phenotypic characteristics, the authors found that patients with more severe asthma, described as more frequent exacerbations and more medication use, were more likely to have ICU admission or death. Interestingly, the hazard ratios do not clearly reflect a consistent dose-dependent effect of inhaled steroids, which is most pronounced in those with intermittent and, even more so, regular use of inhaled corticosteroid plus add-on therapy. These findings suggest that there may be a threshold of asthma severity, or a phenotype indicated by the use of add-on therapy, for which this risk is most substantial. Neither atopy or eosinophil count significantly influenced the risk of diagnosis, hospitalization, or mortality in this dataset.

### Predictors of repeated acute hospital attendance for asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a7ddee7d]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in children 1 and its worldwide prevalence is still rising, with an estimated 300 million people affected. 2 For many years, daily symptoms have been the focus of treatment guidelines, and physicians have used control questionnaires to guide treatment adjustments. However, current guidelines 3, 4 have an increasing focus on the risk of adverse outcomes, such as asthma attacks, as this risk is not directly correlated with daily control. Children with largely well‐controlled symptoms are still at risk of developing severe asthma attacks. 5

Asthma attacks are common 6 and are associated with high healthcare costs 7 as well as missed school and workdays. They cause anxiety 8 and carry a risk of death and long‐term effects such as loss of lung function. 9 These acute events are especially relevant for children among whom there is the greatest potential for loss of lung function. Attacks often follow a viral respiratory tract infection 10, 11 but secondary care attendance is generally preventable. Attacks may occur despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids, 5, 12 though it is neither affordable nor safe to provide all children with more aggressive treatment, particularly in low‐middle income countries. It is therefore important to be able to identify patients at greatest risk of further attacks and hospital admission to better prioritize limited resources and provide additional education and support or adjustments to treatment where most needed.

### Ipratropium treatment of acute airways disease [^958adab8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the use of ipratropium bromide in adults with acute exacerbation of either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during admission and at discharge from 3 teaching hospitals.

Methods

An extensive range of clinical and demographic data was retrospectively extracted from the medical records of consecutive patients aged ≥ 12 years admitted to the medical wards of the hospitals during 1999–2001 with acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD, either as a primary diagnosis or as a major comorbidity.

Results

Data were gathered for 302 patients (97 with asthma, 205 with COPD). Almost 90% of all patients received ipratropium bromide during their hospital admission. The indication for using ipratropium bromide during hospitalization was considered appropriate in 84% of the asthma patients and 68% of the COPD patients. Over 20% of the patients with asthma had been using ipratropium bromide prior to the hospital admission, and almost one-third of the patients with asthma were discharged with ipratropium bromide, even though its role in chronic asthma is limited. More than 90% of the patients received nebulized drug therapy during their hospital stay, with 41% being prescribed nebulized therapy at discharge. This was often considered inappropriate, given that > 50% of all patients had been using inhaler devices and nebulizers concurrently while hospitalized.

Conclusions

In the majority of cases, ipratropium bromide had been used during hospitalization in accordance with guidelines for the management of acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. However, there was also evidence of potentially inappropriate prolonged use of the agent in the community setting, particularly for asthma. Also of concern was the relatively high use of nebulized drug therapy when delivery via other means was appropriate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e5307e4b]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use antibiotics routinely in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations unless there is strong evidence of lung infection (such as fever or purulent sputum or radiographic evidence of pneumonia).

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5d6cd62d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory failure due to severe acute exacerbations of asthma [^7aa40035]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition causing inflammation and changes to the airways. Care of people with asthma includes routine and urgent management across primary and tertiary care; however, due to sub-optimal long-term care and delays in obtaining help during acute exacerbations, the mortality and morbidity related to asthma is still a major health concern. There is reason to believe that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) could be beneficial to patients with severe acute asthma; however, the evidence surrounding the efficacy of NPPV is unclear, despite its common use in clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NPPV in adults with severe acute asthma in comparison to usual medical care with respect to mortality, tracheal intubation, changes in blood gases and hospital length of stay.

Search Methods

We carried out a search in the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (July 2012). Following this, the bibliographies of included studies and review articles were searched for additional studies (July 2012).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults with severe acute asthma as the primary reason for presentation to the emergency department or for admission to hospital. Asthma diagnosis was defined by internationally accepted criteria. Studies were included if the intervention was usual medical care for the management of severe acute asthma plus NPPV applied through a nasal or facemask compared to usual medical care alone. Studies including patients with features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were excluded unless data were provided separately for patients with asthma in studies recruiting both COPD and asthmatic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

A combination of two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where required. All data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. For continuous variables, a mean difference and 95% confidence interval were used and for dichotomous variables, risk ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated.

Main Results

We identified six trials for inclusion. Five studies on 206 participants contributed data, while one study was available in abstract form only and was not fully incorporated into this review. For the primary outcome of endotracheal intubation there were two studies that contributed data: two intubations were needed in 45 participants on NPPV and no intubations in 41 control patients (risk ratio 4.48; 95% CI 0.23 to 89.13). There were no deaths in either of these studies. Length of hospital stay was reported in two studies, though meta-analysis was not possible. Hospitalisation was reported in one small study, in which there were three admissions out of 17 on NPPV and 10 admissions out of 16 in control patients (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09, 0.84).

Authors' Conclusions

This review of studies has highlighted the paucity of data that exist to support the use of NPPV in patients in status asthmaticus. As such this course of treatment remains controversial despite its continued use in current clinical practice. Larger, prospective randomised controlled trials of rigorous methodological design are needed to determine the role of NPPV in patients with asthma.

### Identification and management of adults with asthma prone to exacerbations: can we do better? [^0dccb409]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Definition and risk factors for exacerbations

Severe exacerbations, defined as the need for courses of high dose corticosteroids or hospitalization because of asthma, occur most commonly in patients with severe asthma. This group can experience exacerbation rates ranging from 1.5 to over 4 exacerbations per year. Information on previous asthma control, co-morbidities and demographic factors as well as physiological and inflammatory biomarkers may help identify some individuals prone to exacerbations. These factors are often associated with severe asthma. A history of a recent exacerbation within the last 3 months is associated with a considerably increased risk of a future exacerbation [relative risk (RR) 3.7]. Several co-morbidities in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma are associated with recurrent exacerbations including severe nasal sinus disease [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.7], gastro-esophageal reflux (OR 4.9), recurrent respiratory infections (OR 6.9), psychological problems (OR 10.8) and obstructive sleep apnea (OR 3.4). Current smokers with asthma are more likely to experience exacerbations compared to non-smokers with asthma. A raised body mass index is also a risk factor for exacerbations [RR 1.7 (1.2–2.3)] and hospitalization because of asthma. Hospital admission rates for asthma in the US are associated with lower socio-economic status and are higher in black and Hispanic patients with asthma compared to whites. A low pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of 60 to 80% of predicted gives a 2.4-fold increased risk of an exacerbation, which rises to 4.6-fold increased risk when the pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 is < 60% of predicted. Addition of information gained from questionnaires, including a history of pet ownership, increases the likelihood of identifying exacerbations over the next 30 months to a medium risk (RR 3.0) or high risk (RR 11).

The categorisation of patients with severe asthma by cluster analyses into different phenotypes termed early onset atopic asthma, obese non-eosinophilic asthma, early symptoms predominant asthma and inflammation predominant asthma found that exacerbation rates were high in each of the distinct categories, but that no sub-group was more prone to exacerbations. Thus despite the association between known risk factors and exacerbations it remains difficult to accurately predict in an individual patient with asthma whether they will go on to develop an exacerbation in the future.

### Risks of poor asthma outcome in 14, 405 children and young people in london [^0ecc7e5a]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The definition, for the purpose of this study, for asthma exacerbations included hospital admissions and/or GP-coded episodes of asthma attacks and/or GP prescriptions for short courses of oral corticosteroids. While prescriptions for OCS are used as an outcome and/or a marker for an attack in most published studies investigating asthma medications and care, these may not always be prescribed appropriately. In this population of CYP, at least 5% had suffered from severe asthma attacks (i.e. had been admitted to hospital); however, it is unclear how many of the 1485 children prescribed 2123 short courses of oral prednisolone had severe attacks without being admitted to hospital. A common problem in the UK is that severity of asthma attacks is not often assessed objectively, as recommended in the current SIGN/BTS guideline, table 17. While there is uncertainty of the level of overlap in those classified with exacerbations, it is clear from this data that not all asthma exacerbations were coded as such by the general practitioners, making it difficult to identify those in need of a post exacerbation review as recommended in NICEand the SIGN/BTSguidelines.

### The frequency of asthma exacerbations and healthcare utilization in patients with asthma from the UK and USA [^92cde649]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using data from > 200,000 patients with asthma in both the US and UK, we demonstrated that the frequency and risk of asthma exacerbations, HRU, and healthcare costs (US only) all increased with disease severity. In particular, these outcomes increased in patients with higher GINA Step, a frequent history of exacerbations, and severe uncontrolled and severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma status. Interestingly, the results suggest a higher exacerbation frequency, lower medication use and higher ED/hospital re-admission rates in the US compared with the UK. Appropriate post-discharge medication, healthcare practitioner follow-up, and asthma management plans should be ensured for patients admitted to the ED or hospital for asthma. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma warrant more attentive post-discharge clinical supervision given their increased risk of a recurrent ED/hospital re-admission.

The patient should be followed to ensure that asthma symptoms return to well controlled and that lung function returns to their personal best (if known), and refer for expert advice if ICU treatment was required or if there were one or more other exacerbations in the last 12 months.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations… [^f93be9ed]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is intravenous magnesium sulfate effective for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation that has not responded to first-line therapy can be treated effectively with intravenous magnesium sulfate. In children, magnesium sulfate reduced hospital admissions by 68%. In adults, magnesium sulfate reduced admissions by 25%. Evidence Summary A 2016 Cochrane review of three RCTs found that treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate reduced the odds of hospital admissions by 68% in patients 18 months to 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations. A 2014 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs found a 25% reduction in hospital admissions in adults who were treated in the emergency department with intravenous magnesium sulfate for asthma exacerbation. 2 The number needed to treat to prevent one admission was 7. Most of the studies were double-blinded trials comparing intravenous magnesium sulfate vs. placebo after first-line therapy was ineffective. The authors reported statistically significant but clinically minimal improvements in the secondary outcomes of forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow. Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend treating patients with acute asthma exacerbation with repeated doses of short-acting bronchodilators, early oral corticosteroids, and controlled-flow oxygen if available.

3 In those with severe exacerbations, ipratropium should be added and nebulized short-acting bronchodilators should be considered. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered if the patient does not respond to intensive initial treatment. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network.

### Pediatric asthma admissions: chronic severity and acute exacerbations [^fada3f8f]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Factors resulting in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for asthma exacerbations remain largely unclear. We compared ICU and general pediatric ward admissions for asthma exacerbations. Charts of 56 (2- to 18-year-old) patients admitted consecutively to the ICU during a 1-year period for asthma exacerbations were compared with charts of 56 age-, sex-, race-, and era-matched patients admitted to a general pediatric ward. Few patients in both groups received oral steroids before admission. Children with different chronic asthma severities had comparable severities of acute exacerbation. In conclusion, acute asthma exacerbations dissociate in severity from chronic asthma and are under-treated with systemic corticosteroids.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5908ddac]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pulmonary function testing in patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to the emergency department. Document peak expiratory flow or FEV1, if possible and without unduly delaying treatment, before initiating treatment. Monitor lung function at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response to treatment has occurred or a plateau is reached.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^8facfa30]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Sex differences in asthma and COPD hospital admission, readmission and mortality [^f9c074a8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes vary by sex. We investigated whether males and females with asthma or COPD are managed differently in-hospital when admitted for an exacerbation.

Methods

Data from the National Asthma and COPD Audit Programme were used to determine three cohorts of people hospitalised for an exacerbation: (1) adults with asthma, (2) children and young people (CYP) with asthma, and (3) adults with COPD. Outcomes included the following in-hospital interventional measures: spirometry recording, respiratory specialist review, respiratory medication administration and discharge bundle recording. Linked hospital data were used to determine 30-day and 90-day readmissions and Office for National Statistics data for 90-day mortality. Random effects logistic regression was used to investigate the association between sex and in-hospital outcomes, readmission and mortality.

Results

16 370 adults with asthma, 7156 CYP with asthma and 28 354 adults with COPD were included. Female adults with asthma had higher odds of being seen by a respiratory specialist (a OR 0.1.13, 1.02–1.26) and higher odds of readmission within 30 and 90 days (a OR 1.22, 1.10–1.37, a OR 1.34, 1.23–1.46) compared with males. Female adults with COPD had higher odds of being seen by a respiratory specialist, (a OR 1.10,1.02–1.19), being administered non-invasive ventilation (a OR 1.18, 1.09–1.29), and receiving a discharge bundle (a OR 1.07, 1.00–1.14), and lower odds of readmission within 90 days (a OR 0.95, 0.90–1.01), or mortality within 90 days (a OR 0.88, 0.81–0.96). Lastly, female CYP had higher odds of steroids administered within 1 hour (a OR 1.13, 1.00–1.28) and higher 30-day and 90-day readmission compared with males (a OR 1.21, 1.00–1.44 and 1.17, 1.03–1.34).

Interpretation

Sex differences in in-hospital care exist in adults COPD, which may impact readmissions and mortality; however, little to no sex differences in in-hospital care were seen in people with asthma yet females were more likely to be readmitted to hospital.

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on asthma exacerbations in new zealand: an interrupted time series analysis [^a5976619]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study found an overall reduction in asthma exacerbation rate by 33% across all demographic groups. This reduction is similar to the 36% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for asthma observed by Davies et alin Scotland and Wales following lockdown. Our study however captured exacerbations by measuring changes in hospitalizations for asthma and in dispensings of OCSs. We saw a reduction in overall hospital admissions for asthma by 41.6% and in OCS dispensings by 32.6%. This suggests that the reduction in severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization may have been greater than the exacerbations managed in primary care by OCSs. This contrasts with the findings reported by Shah et al, which found a significant reduction in severe asthma exacerbations following lockdown for those managed in primary care with OCSs, but no significant reduction in exacerbations requiring hospital care. This difference may be due to the way exacerbations data are captured in the 2 studies. In the United Kingdom, national primary care data are available, whereas in NZ, there are no national primary care data sets; thus, we were only able to measure exacerbations managed in primary care via OCS dispensings as a proxy marker. We found that most of the exacerbation data were related to OCS use. There is a possibility that this may have overestimated exacerbation rates because OCSs can be used for indications other than for asthma; however, because we only had patients with asthma in the study, the risk is likely to be low. We tried to improve the accuracy of this by including only those OCSs that are used for asthma exacerbations. In contrast, these data may have underestimated asthma hospitalizations because NZ data sets capture hospitalizations only if the patient is admitted but do not capture attendance at emergency departments nor presentation at accident and emergency clinics in the community. However, emergency department or accident and emergency clinic presentation without OCS dispensing is unlikely to be a true exacerbation and our inclusion of OCS dispensing data is likely to capture most outpatient presentations of exacerbations. This is true also for our identification of the asthma cohort because patients were identified with asthma on the basis of their dispensing records of asthma medication and/or presentation to hospital with asthma. It may be that patients are using asthma medication for other reasons (eg, for general shortness of breath or respiratory tract infections, or in the case of inhaled budesonide, for management of COVID-19). Conversely, there are likely patients with asthma who are not captured in this cohort if they do not use regular asthma medication and have not had a hospitalization for asthma. Because this is a database study, the accuracy of the data included also relies on the accuracy of coding captured by the Ministry of Health data sets.

### Prognostic nomogram for inpatients with asthma exacerbation [^fc13fe95]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the clinical characteristics, admission status, and all-cause in-hospital mortality of patients with asthma exacerbation who required hospitalization. We also developed a nomogram that predicted in-hospital mortality. Our study revealed that the mortality rate of patients who were admitted due to exacerbation was 0.6%. Moreover, in-hospital mortality was associated with older age, male sex, disturbance of consciousness, pneumonia, and heart failure at admission. A nomogram was generated based on seven variables at admission to predict in-hospital death.

In this study, the in-hospital mortality rate for asthma was 0.6%, which is broadly comparable to the previous reports based on nationally representative data of the US (0.5%) and UK (0.43%). There may be several reasons behind the difference in asthma-related mortality observed in our study with that observed in previous studies; one of the most likely reasons may be the age difference among patients included in the study. Our study did not include young patients, including infants and children, and the proportion of older patients was higher than that in previous reports. Since young patients with asthma are reported to have relatively favorable outcomes, it is likely that in-hospital mortality is higher in the present study than previous reports. The proportion of patients who required intubation/mechanical ventilation was 3.9%, which is similar to that indicated by the previous US report (4.2%).

Patients with clinical features of both asthma and COPD have been referred to have "asthma COPD overlap" (ACO) syndrome. Our previous study has demonstrated that compared with asthma alone, patients with ACO exhibit significantly higher in-hospital mortality. In this study, although the in-hospital mortality of patients with ACO was higher than that of patients with asthma alone, the difference was not significant, probably because of the low death rate among the study population.

Previous studies have reported that short-term mortality of patients with asthma exacerbation is associated with older age, male sex, transferred on admission, mechanical ventilation, past intubation, and more comorbid conditions. Our study also identified these factors as the predictors of short-term in-hospital mortality in patients with asthma exacerbation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reveals for the first time that in-hospital mortality is associated with lower level of consciousness.

### Asthma-related emergency admissions and associated healthcare resource use in Alberta, Canada [^4b592240]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is among the most common chronic conditions in Canada, affecting 4 million individuals. Asthma exacerbations are potentially life-threatening events in which symptoms progressively escalate, and lung function worsens to a point where urgent care may be needed. At least 65 000 asthma-related emergency department (ED) admissions occur in Canada each year. In Alberta, there were over 10 000 asthma-related ED admissions annually from 2011 to 2015. Patients with a history of an asthma-related hospital or ED admission are at increased risk of asthma-related death.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention recommend that patients who are admitted to the ED for asthma exacerbation receive a follow-up appointment within 2–7 days of discharge, for reassessment of treatment and understanding of self-management strategies. The Health Quality Ontario asthma quality standard follows the same recommendation. Despite these recommendations, asthma often remains uncontrolled, and exacerbations continue to result in additional healthcare resource use (HCRU), increasing the risks for future asthma hospitalisation. An earlier study with over 115 000 asthma-related ED discharges in Alberta showed 26% of patients had repeat ED admissions during the study period (1999–2011), and 5.1% were readmitted within 30 days. Furthermore, only half of the patients had a follow-up visit within 30 days after discharge. The burden of ED admissions is substantial on the Canadian healthcare system as EDs are plagued with staffing shortages, reduced services and capacity issues. Decreasing preventable ED admissions of any aetiology is a priority to free oversubscribed emergency services and to sustain the healthcare system in Canada.

Given the potential benefits of follow-up care and education strategies post-ED discharge to reduce readmissions, there is a lack of current real-world evidence characterising if and how these interventions are implemented in clinical practice. The objective of this study is to better understand contemporary patterns of physician visits, admissions to inpatient services and ED readmissions following an asthma-related ED admission to identify opportunities for better asthma management in Canada, specifically in the province of Alberta.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^04b03156]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer systemic corticosteroids in acute care settings to speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapses in all adult, adolescent, and pediatric (6–11 years of age) patients with asthma exacerbation, except for the mildest exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^350ec9b6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.

Exacerbations

Exacerbations were defined as hospital admission for asthma attack or GP-coded entry for asthma attack or GP prescription for a short course of oral corticosteroids: during the 12 months: (i) 749 (5%) CYP were admitted to hospital for 797 episodes; 32 (< 1%) of these CYP had between 2 and 6 admissions; (ii) 910 (6%) CYP were coded by the GPs as having had 1168 asthma attacks; 170 (1%) had between 2 and 12 asthma attacks; (iii) 1485 (10%) CYP had 2123 prescriptions for short courses of oral corticosteroids; 408 (3%) were prescribed between 2 and 11 courses (see Table 2). While each of the three defined exacerbation events were unique, it was not possible to determine the level to which these episodes overlapped.

### Asthma diagnosis and management [^86252e62]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). This article provides an evidence-based review of diagnosis and management of asthma. Early recognition of asthma exacerbations and initiation of treatment are essential. Treatment is dictated by the severity of the exacerbation. Treatment involves bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other treatment modalities including magnesium, heliox, and noninvasive ventilator support are discussed. Safe disposition from the ED can be considered after stabilization of the exacerbation, response to treatment and attaining peak flow measures.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Is severity assessment after one hour of treatment better for predicting the need for admission in acute asthma? [^a39b7f7e]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine if severity assessment after 1 h of treatment is better than assessment at presentation for predicting the requirement for hospital admission for emergency department (ED) patients with acute asthma.

Methods

Prospective, observational study conducted in 36 Australian ED for a 2-week period in 2001 involving patients aged 1–55 years presenting with asthma. Data collected included severity assessment according to the National Asthma Guidelines (Australia) at presentation and 1 h, and disposition. Descriptive analysis was applied.

Results

720 cases were analysed. Patients with 'mild' asthma at either assessment time had a greater than 80% chance of discharge home. Patients assessed as 'severe' at either assessment had a greater than 85% chance of requiring hospital admission, but the 1 h assessment was better at predicting the need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. For the 'moderate' group, the initial assessment was a poor predictor of the need for admission however those who met the criteria for 'moderate' severity at 1 h had an 84% chance of requiring admission.

Conclusion

Assessment of asthma severity after 1 h of treatment is better than initial severity assessment for determining the need for hospital admission for patients initially assessed as having 'moderate' asthma and for predicting the need for ICU in patients initially assessed as 'severe'.

### Effect of low climate impact vs. high climate impact inhalers for patients with asthma and COPD-a nationwide cohort analysis [^1421f3bc]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ICS delivered by low climate impact inhalers was not associated to a higher risk of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and all-cause mortality than ICS delivered by high climate impact inhalers. ICS delivered by low climate impact inhalers was also not associated to a higher risk of all-cause mortality, exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, or all-cause admission. ICS delivered by low climate impact inhalers was neither associated to a lower or a higher risk of admission with pneumonia. Finally, ICS delivered by high climate impact inhalers was associated to a slightly higher risk of exacerbations requiring a prescription of prednisolone without hospitalisation.

This is the first study comparing COPD exacerbation and death of ICS delivered by low and high climate impact inhalers in patients with both asthma and COPD. Our study is large, has complete follow-up, and available data for controlling several important confounders such at spirometry measures, tobacco history, MRC and BMI. Furthermore, we found no difference in safety profile depending on ICS delivered by low and high climate impact inhalers in patients with asthma and COPD, despite extensive theories on different anatomical deposition patterns, pharmacokinetic properties and device managing. This finding should be interpreted in the light of the extensive damage to the climate from high climate impact inhalers.

The patients in our primary analysis were very closely matched by nine clinical characteristics (age, gender, tobacco exposure, exacerbations requiring hospitalization, MRC, BMI, FEV 1%, ICS dose and entry date) in order to minimize bias by indication.

Analyses of secondary outcomes similarly revealed no difference in safety profile for ICS delivered by low vs. high climate impact inhalers, with comparable HRs for pneumonia. The analysis on the effect of ICS delivered by high and low climate impact inhalers was elaborated by secondary outcome analyses on all-cause mortality, exacerbations requiring hospitalization or all-cause admission.

One outcome analysis did show an increased risk in patients treated with ICS delivered by high climate impact inhalers: exacerbations requiring prescriptions of prednisolone, but not hospitalization. However, the clinical relevance remains uncertain with a CI almost crossing one. We analysed hospitalisations with exacerbations and hospitalisations with pneumonia as well as exacerbations treated with prednisolone, but we did not analyse exacerbations of concomitant asthma and COPD treated only with antibiotics, as this is not a standard recommended treatment regimen when a patient also suffers from asthma, however, we may have missed some exacerbations / pneumonias not requiring hospitalisation in this context and a difference between groups cannot be ruled out in our study set-up.

### Asthma outcomes: exacerbations [^00a97f79]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The goals of asthma treatment include preventing recurrent exacerbations. Yet there is no consensus about the terminology for describing or defining "exacerbation" or about how to characterize an episode's severity.

Objective

National Institutes of Health institutes and other federal agencies convened an expert group to propose how asthma exacerbation should be assessed as a standardized asthma outcome in future asthma clinical research studies.

Methods

We used comprehensive literature reviews and expert opinion to compile a list of asthma exacerbation outcomes and classified them as either core (required in future studies), supplemental (used according to study aims and standardized), or emerging (requiring validation and standardization). This work was discussed at a National Institutes of Health-organized workshop in March 2010 and finalized in September 2011.

Results

No dominant definition of "exacerbation" was found. The most widely used definitions included 3 components, all related to treatment, rather than symptoms: (1) systemic use of corticosteroids, (2) asthma-specific emergency department visits or hospitalizations, and (3) use of short-acting β-agonists as quick-relief (sometimes referred to as "rescue" or "reliever") medications.

Conclusions

The working group participants propose that the definition of "asthma exacerbation" be "a worsening of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids to prevent a serious outcome". As core outcomes, they propose inclusion and separate reporting of several essential variables of an exacerbation. Furthermore, they propose the development of a standardized, component-based definition of "exacerbation" with clear thresholds of severity for each component.

Pandemic Effects on Exacerbations

Asthma

Unexpectedly marked changes in the incidence of acute asthma attacks during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been observed internationally. In the United States, a study of 3,959 children and adolescents with diagnosed asthma found all-cause healthcare encounters decreased significantly during the pandemic compared with the preceding year. This included well-child visits (48.1% during the pandemic vs. 66.6% in the prior year; P < 0.01), emergency department visits (9.7% vs. 21.0%; P < 0.01), and inpatient admissions (1.6% vs. 2.5%; P < 0.01), despite a 100-fold increase in telehealth encounters. Asthma exacerbations that required treatment with systemic steroids also decreased (127 vs. 504 exacerbations; P < 0.01). A Harvard-led multicenter study found a significant decrease in asthma exacerbations in the first six months of 2020 compared with 2019 (–0.47 exacerbations per year [95% confidence interval (CI), –0.76 to –0.19; P = 0.001], a relative reduction of 41%).

In a large UK National Health Service Trust hospital, a significant reduction in all-cause and exacerbation-related asthma and COPD admissions (∼30% and 40%, respectively) was observed, although patients also reported a subjective decline in disease control and a negative impact on their mental health. Also in the United Kingdom, a study of a primary care database of 9,949,387 patients containing 100,165 patients with asthma found a significant reduction in attendance to primary care for asthma exacerbations during the pandemic in all age groups, both sexes, and across most regions in England.

During pandemic measures, a Japanese survey of 10,226 inpatient subjects diagnosed with asthma exacerbations in 83 hospitals between October 2018 and September 2020 found a > 70% decrease in pediatric patients with asthma exacerbations requiring hospital admission.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^1cefc6a1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data about the feasibility of measuring lung function in hospitalized patients suspected of having an asthma or COPD exacerbation. A recent single-hospital study by Rea and colleagues found that spirometry, performed upon hospital discharge, can serve as a baseline against which post-discharge measurements can be compared. However, we are not aware of studies that have specifically examined the quality of spirometry tests obtained early in the course of hospitalizations for patients with COPD or asthma exacerbations and their utility in confirming the presence of obstructive lung disease.

Rea and colleagues also showed that approximately 16% of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbations did not meet the GOLD criteria for COPD by spirometry on hospital discharge. Data about the prevalence of patients with a physician diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation but in whom spirometry fails to confirm obstructive lung disease (i.e. overdiagnosis) are lacking.

To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted a multi-center study in adults hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation to: a) evaluate the quality of spirometry tracings; and b) assess the utility of confirmatory spirometry for the presence of obstructive lung disease in patients hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation. The findings reported in this study may help determine the need for confirmatory testing in clinical care setting, or as part of quality improvement efforts, such as pay-for-performance, in adults hospitalized with a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbation.

Assessment of response and additional bronchodilator treatment — severe exacerbation in children: Children with a severe asthma exacerbation must be observed for at least 1 hour after initiation of treatment; if symptoms persist after initial bronchodilator, a further 2–6 puffs of salbutamol may be given 20 minutes after the first dose and repeated at 20-minute intervals for an hour, consider adding 1–2 puffs of ipratropium, and failure to respond at 1 hour or earlier deterioration should prompt admission to hospital with addition of nebulized ipratropium and a short course of oral corticosteroids. If symptoms have improved by 1 hour but recur within 3–4 hours, the child may be given more frequent doses of bronchodilator (2–3 puffs each hour) and oral corticosteroids should be given, and children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3–4 hour period should be referred immediately to hospital. If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1–2 hours, no further treatment may be required; further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3–4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24 hours), and if symptoms persist beyond 1 day, inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated.

Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.

### An early rehabilitation intervention to enhance recovery during hospital admission for an exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease: randomised controlled trial [^ba06f1b9]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic asthma, bronchiectasis, and interstitial lung disease, are at increased risk of mortality, morbidity, and further episodes of unscheduled hospital admission. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the second most common cause for unscheduled hospital admission in the United Kingdom, accounting for the largest component of health costs associated with the disease.

Admission to hospital has negative effects on physical performance and health status from which the patient may not fully recover. Treatment of the acute episode is predominantly targeted at improvement of ventilatory function, with little attention paid to these wider systemic impacts. Consequently, physical performance and activity may be reduced for a prolonged period after hospital stay, increasing the risk of readmission.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is of established efficacy in stable chronic respiratory diseases, and small scale trials of pulmonary rehabilitation delivered after discharge from hospital for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have suggested a reduction in the short term risk of readmission. However, the effects of the acute episode on physical fitness and skeletal muscle function may occur rapidly during the inpatient phasesuggesting that a rehabilitation intervention delivered at the time of the acute illness might preserve physical function and reduce the risk of subsequent admission to hospital. This is supported by previous small scale trials of exercise based therapy during acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which have suggested such interventions are feasible and may be effective. An early exercise/mobility intervention is a component of wider enhanced recovery programmes, which have been successfully implemented for patients undergoing elective surgery but have not been widely applied to unscheduled medical admissions.

We conducted a randomised clinical trial of a progressive, exercise based rehabilitation intervention delivered immediately after unscheduled admission to hospital for an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease. The principles underpinning the intervention were that it should be delivered early in the admission with the aim of preventing decline in physical performance, should be provided intensively making best use of the time spent in hospital, and should be continued after discharge to maximise the restoration of physical performance and activity and obviate the need to extend the hospital stay to provide treatment. We hypothesised that this intervention would reduce the risk of readmission in the following year and accelerate recovery of physical functioning.

Acute asthma exacerbations in children 5 years or younger — assessment of severity outlines: conduct a brief history and examination concurrently with the initiation of therapy; the presence of any of the features of a severe exacerbation listed in Box 12–2 are an indication of the need for urgent treatment and immediate transfer to hospital (Evidence D); oxygen saturation from pulse oximetry of < 92% on presentation (before oxygen or bronchodilator treatment) is associated with high morbidity and likely need for hospitalization, and saturation of 92–95% is also associated with higher risk; oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color; agitation, drowsiness and confusion are features of cerebral hypoxemia; a quiet chest on auscultation indicates minimal ventilation, insufficient to produce a wheeze; and PRAM and PASS have been developed for assessing the severity of acute asthma exacerbations in children.

Diagnosis of asthma in children under 5 (BTS/NICE/SIGN) and under 6 (GINA) in primary care

It is generally accepted that a diagnosis of asthma in a young child is difficult and should be strictly questioned under the age of 2 when an alternative diagnosis is more likely.

A diagnosis of asthma is suggested by the presence of:
Characteristic variable symptoms of recurrent wheeze, breathlessness or cough with multiple triggers (other than just with viral infections), a family or past history of atopic disease, absence of symptoms to suggest an alternative diagnosis (e.g. failure to thrive).
A positive trial of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS). ○ Beclometasone or equivalentto 50–100 mcg daily delivered standard aerosol particle metered -dose-inhaler(MDI)plus spacer with mask is given twice a day for 8–12 weeks. The ICS is then withdrawn. ○ A trial is deemed positive if there is symptomatic improvement whilst the child is on the ICS and there is symptomatic worsening when the ICS is withdrawn.

If the child remains symptomatic and has not responded to the ICS then referral to a respiratory paediatrician is recommended.

The BTS/NICE/SIGN Guideline also recommends that any pre-school child with an admission to hospital or 2 or more admissions to an emergency department with wheeze within a 12- month period should be referred to a respiratory paediatrician and that objective tests are carried out when the child reaches the age of 5.

### The frequency of asthma exacerbations and healthcare utilization in patients with asthma from the UK and USA [^5c0c49e6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

As expected, in both countries, the use of ICS/LABA and OCS increased with markers of disease severity including GINA Step, Leidy category, and exacerbation history, and was higher in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma or severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma status versus patients who had non-severe asthma. In the current study, despite the increased medication usage in patients with more severe disease, total HRU during the 30 days after an exacerbation was still highest in these patients. Reflecting this, a previous study demonstrated in patients with persistent asthma symptoms that despite high-intensity treatment, the number of asthma exacerbations over a 5-year period remained relatively unchanged. Most strikingly, the proportion of patients with asthma-related ED/hospital re-admissions in the 30-day period following a previous ED/hospital admission approximately doubled between GINA Step 3 and Step 5. Similarly, a history of frequent exacerbations and a severe disease classification increased asthma-related re-admission rates, with up to 23% experiencing an asthma-related re-admission within 30 days of discharge. These trends are reflected in a previous small-scale US-based study, which demonstrated that the majority of ED visits were made by the most severe patients (≥ 6 ED visits in the previous year) and that markers of severity were independent predictors of high ED use. Together, these results indicate that patients with severe disease are the most likely to require further healthcare utilization after an asthma exacerbation, suggesting that higher levels of step-up care and the use of novel drug classes may be needed.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^eb946f0d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Personalized control-based asthma management — Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction, and in control-based asthma management treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves assessment of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel to achieve the goals of asthma treatment; asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after the introduction of control-based guidelines or practical tools; since 2014, GINA has emphasized personalized management of modifiable risk factors and patient preferences while non‑modifiable risk factors such as a history of past ICU admission should also be documented; for many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations, and when ICSs were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function with decreases in exacerbations and asthma-related mortality; however, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations, some continue to exacerbate despite well-controlled symptoms, and side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses are stepped up, therefore both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk) should be considered when choosing treatment and reviewing response.

### Identification of patterns of factors preceding severe or life-threatening asthma exacerbations in a nationwide study [^bd96f6bd]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The work presented here is a secondary analysis of our previous study, 15 representing details of the events that occur shortly before and during severe or life‐threatening asthma exacerbation. Our results document a gradual increase in the VAS score for asthmatic symptoms over 6‐8 days before hospital admission, to hospital, leading to moderate severity (VAS > 3.3) at 24 hours before admission in all 190 patients surveyed (Figure 2). These results are consistent with a previous study by Tattersfield et al. 13 reported a gradual decline PEF over 5‐7 days associated with severe exacerbation. These investigators also reported that changes in PEF, asthma symptoms, and use of rescue beta‐agonists before exacerbation occurred in a parallel manner. Herein, using serial VAS scores of asthma symptoms, we have identified 3 groups of patients with diverse backgrounds but showing distinct characteristics leading up to severe or life‐threatening exacerbation. As assessed in a real‐world setting rather than a controlled trial, these patients fell into 3 groups with rapid, fairly rapid, or slow progression. We found that there were no differences among these 3 clusters in overuse of SABA before admission, baseline asthma severity, comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or outcome after hospital admission. Interestingly, there were differences in ICS or ICS/LABA compliance, perception of dyspnea, and baseline hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli. These findings imply that optimal personalized management regimens, aimed at preventing severe or life‐threatening asthma exacerbation in normal daily life, would differ even among patients within these clusters.

### Caseworker-assigned discharge plans to prevent hospital readmission for acute exacerbations in children with chronic respiratory illness [^b68c9800]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic respiratory conditions are major causes of mortality and morbidity. Children with chronic health conditions have increased morbidity associated with their physical, emotional, and general well-being. Acute respiratory exacerbations (AREs) are common in children with chronic respiratory disease, often requiring admission to hospital. Reducing the frequency of AREs and recurrent hospitalisations is therefore an important goal in the individual and public health management of chronic respiratory illnesses in children. Discharge planning is used to decide what a person needs for transition from one level of care to another and is usually considered in the context of discharge from hospital to the home. Discharge planning from hospital for ongoing management of an illness has historically been referral to a general practitioner or allied health professional or self management by the individual and their family with limited communication between the hospital and patient once discharged. Effective discharge planning can decrease the risk of recurrent AREs requiring medical care. An individual caseworker-assigned discharge plan may further decrease exacerbations.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of individual caseworker-assigned discharge plans, as compared to non-caseworker-assigned plans, in preventing hospitalisation for AREs in children with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis.

All randomised controlled trials comparing individual caseworker-assigned discharge planning compared to traditional discharge-planning approaches (including self management), and their effectiveness in reducing the subsequent need for emergency care for AREs (hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and/or unscheduled general practitioner visits) in children hospitalised with an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease. We excluded studies that included children with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Review methodological approaches. Relevant studies were independently selected in duplicate. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted the authors of one study for further information.

Main Results

We included four studies involving a total of 773 randomised participants aged between 14 months and 16 years. All four studies involved children with asthma, with the case-planning undertaken by a trained nurse educator. However, the discharge planning/education differed among the studies. We could include data from only two studies (361 children) in the meta-analysis. Two further studies enrolled children in both inpatient and outpatient settings, and one of these studies also included children with acute wheezing illness (no previous asthma diagnosis); the data specific to this review could not be obtained. For the primary outcome of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, those in the intervention group were significantly less likely to be rehospitalised (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.50) compared to controls. This equates to 189 (95% CI 124 to 236) fewer admissions per 1000 children. No adverse events were reported in any study. In the context of substantial statistical heterogeneity between the two studies, there were no statistically significant effects on emergency department (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.05) or general practitioner (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.44) presentations. There were no data on cost-effectiveness, length of stay of subsequent hospitalisations, or adherence to medications. One study reported quality of life, with no significant differences observed between the intervention and control groups. We considered three of the studies to have an unclear risk of bias, primarily due to inadequate description of the blinding of participants and investigators. The fourth study was assessed as at high risk of bias as a single unblinded investigator was used. Using the GRADE system, we assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate for the outcome of hospitalisation and low for the outcomes of emergency department visits and general practitioner consultations.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that individual caseworker-assigned discharge plans, as compared to non-caseworker-assigned plans, may be beneficial in preventing hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations in children with asthma. There was no clear indication that the intervention reduces emergency department and general practitioner attendances for asthma, and there is an absence of data for children with other chronic respiratory conditions. Given the potential benefit and cost savings to the healthcare sector and families if hospitalisations and outpatient attendances can be reduced, there is a need for further randomised controlled trials encompassing different chronic respiratory illnesses, ethnicity, socio-economic settings, and cost-effectiveness, as well as defining the essential components of a complex intervention.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Predictors of repeated acute hospital attendance for asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^376aeba7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have identified individual‐level and factors related to asthma severity that are associated with a greater risk of future asthma attacks requiring emergency care or hospital readmission. This description of the current evidence base and its limitations could help inform future prospective studies that robustly assess the magnitude and interaction of such risk factors. In future, being able to identify children at risk of future asthma attacks requiring emergency care will guide specific interventions such as educational sessions, management of comorbidities, and personalized treatment adjustments. This approach has the potential to reduce the chance of long‐term complications such as loss of lung function, psychological morbidity, and death.

### Confirmatory spirometry for adults hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^a1cc93eb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The study findings have several implications. First, the relatively high frequency of adequate quality spirometry tests (about three-quarters of patients tested) should be encouraging to clinicians who may want to use spirometry in the inpatient setting to confirm the diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Second, the high rates of patients who did not meet the asthma or COPD diagnostic criteria by spirometry (about 20%), which were even higher among obese patients (33%). Given these findings, we recommend that clinicians routinely obtain spirometry in hospitalized patients suspected of having an asthma or a COPD exacerbation.

In conclusion, we found that adequate quality spirometry can be obtained in most patients hospitalized with exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Clinical practice and quality improvement efforts that include spirometry for confirmation of obstructive lung disease may help to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis, which could lead to inappropriate care in this population.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^6518a2df]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma CPG — step-down therapy is presented as: "stepping down (not discontinuing) inhaled corticosteroids dose or discontinuing long-acting beta agonists. (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed)." It is standard practice to make decisions about stepping down therapy after a patient has maintained asthma control on a regimen for at least three months, and even when a patient is on a stable regimen for three or more months, stepping down is avoided during pregnancy, times of stress, recent acute illness, planned travel, peak allergen seasons, and/or for patients who cannot be closely monitored. The recommendation is based on four SRs and two RCTs, with the strongest evidence to avoid complete discontinuation of ICS in adults due to increased exacerbations and asthma symptoms; an SR showed asthma exacerbations were statistically no more likely among patients who reduced the ICS dose compared to those who maintained their ICS dose, another SR found that lowering ICS dose versus continuing a stable dose resulted in inconclusive evidence for exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life, while the same SR reported that stepping down the ICS component of a ICS/LABA versus continuing a stable dose ICS/LABA resulted in equivalent levels of asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. For patients on ICS/LABA, stepping down to ICS alone versus continued stable dose ICS/LABA was examined in both an SR and an RCT; the SR found statistically significant differences favoring continued ICS/LABA therapy with respect to asthma control and asthma-related quality of life, although the authors noted the evidence was insufficient to show effects on important outcomes such as exacerbations requiring hospital admission and serious adverse events.

### Economic impact of a more extensive use of FENO testing on the Italian population with asthma [^eb8c4060]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A second limitation relates to the management of severe asthma patients who in about 70% of cases present comorbidities. The analysis excluded the cost component for the management of concomitant diseases, anyway the latter should have an impact only on the frequency of hospital accesses, for example more admissions for patients with more comorbidities, and not on the economic value of the hospitalization. In fact, a comorbid asthmatic hospitalized patient is not treated differently from an asthmatic patient without comorbidity and the reimbursement applied to the hospital admission is the one already considered in the analysis. This aspect, has been totally captured by the population we considered in the analysis, which derives from estimates on administrative databases.

One of the advantages of FeNO testing is to discriminate refractory Type- 2 high patients that are likely to require personalized therapies like biologics. In Italy there are published data on the consumption and expense of biologics but these figures are not disaggregated for the different specific indications (for example data on dupilumab are referred to severe atopic dermatitis, severe and refractory asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps), therefore an analysis on the number of patients treated with biologics for asthma according to a FeNO test was not feasible. Moreover, the investigation is complicated by a not homogeneous diffusion of the test across the different Italian Regions.

In the analysis we gave an overview of the costs for the management of patients with asthma for both SOC and FeNO testing scenarios in Italy by combining different sources of data. The number of serious exacerbations per year requiring hospitalization was derived from two different sources reporting data at national level for patients older than 15 years and younger than 14 years, therefore there was a lack of information for patients aged 14–15 years. As the number of non-serious exacerbations was estimated by the difference between the total estimated exacerbations and the severe ones, the exacerbations for patients aged 14–15 years were classified as non-severe, thus underestimating the real management cost. Moreover, the analysis considered only specialist visits performed by the patients leading to another possible cause of underestimation of costs.

Another point relates to the effects of the determination of FeNO on the treatment optimization leading to a decrease in the frequency of exacerbations, consumption of oral corticosteroids and, therefore, the appearance of complications resulting from the use of these drugs. In this context a therapeutic adherence is assumed, anyway patients' compliance is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to measure and might only partially depend on the use of FeNo test for asthma control. A limited therapeutic adherence may decrease the advantages of FeNO testing.

### Development of a risk prediction model to predict the risk of hospitalization due to exacerbated asthma among adult asthma patients in a lower middle-income country [^858a1e4a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

By setting the cut-off threshold at 4.5, our model was able to capture 69% of the asthma patients who will incur future hospitalizations due to exacerbations. Most of the prior models reported to have sensitivity lower than the present model. These models have been developed commonly by using large healthcare databases and their predictor variables are limited to variables that can be obtained from those databases.

A case-control study design was adopted to evaluate the criterion validity of the present model considering the limitation of time and logistics. However, the ideal study design recommended for this purpose is a follow-up study where high-risk asthma patients should be followed up, to see whether they get hospitalized due to exacerbations as predicted by the risk prediction model.

The hospitalization status of these asthma patients was confirmed clinically using an admission criterion supported by clinic records. Verification bias is a possibility in this method, as there was no such gold standard test that can be applied to all participants to confirm their status of hospitalization. But this has been minimized by strictly adhering to admission criteria in selecting cases, and by reviewing and reconfirming their admission status by a clinician at both clinic and ward settings.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^db0a98d6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial presentation during an acute exacerbation indicates that for "Initial asthma presentation is during an acute exacerbation," the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium-dose MART (Evidence D)." The alternative initial treatment (Track 2) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA (Evidence D)."
