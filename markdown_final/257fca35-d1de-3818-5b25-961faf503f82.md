## Question

Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail on Monday, 10 more pieces of mail on Tuesday than on Monday, 5 fewer on Wednesday than on Tuesday, and 15 more pieces of mail on Thursday than on Wednesday. How many pieces of mail did Lauren send?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many pieces of mail Lauren sent across Monday through Thursday, given the daily relationships and a starting value of 65 on Monday. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base value on Monday. Then, I should calculate Tuesday's total based on Monday. Next, I will determine Wednesday's total from Tuesday. After that, I will compute Thursday's total from Wednesday. Finally, I will sum the four days and double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the base value. On Monday, Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail, so Monday = 65.

> Now, Tuesday is 10 more than Monday, so Tuesday = 65 + 10 = 75. Wait, let me verify that addition: 65 + 10 is indeed 75, so that's correct.

> Wednesday is 5 fewer than Tuesday, so Wednesday = 75 − 5 = 70. Hold on, I should verify the subtraction: 75 − 5 equals 70, which checks out.

> Thursday is 15 more than Wednesday, so Thursday = 70 + 15 = 85. I should double-check that: 70 + 15 is 85, yes.

> Next, I should review the total. Total mail = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday = 65 + 75 + 70 + 85. Let me add stepwise: 65 + 75 = 140, then 140 + 70 = 210, then 210 + 85 = 295. So the total is 295 pieces of mail.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the total might be 300, but that would have been an overestimate; the correct sum is 295, not 300. I should confirm the final addition one more time: 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = 295. Yes, that's accurate.

---

Lauren sent a total of **295 pieces of mail** from Monday to Thursday. Here's the breakdown: Monday 65, Tuesday 75, Wednesday 70, and Thursday 85. The total is 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = **295**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Day** | **Mail sent** |
|-|-|
| Monday | 65 |
| Tuesday | 65 + 10 = 75 |
| Wednesday | 75 − 5 = 70 |
| Thursday | 70 + 15 = 85 |
| Total | 65 + 75 + 70 + 85 = 295 |

---

Lauren sent **295 pieces of mail** in total.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^213c0c61]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

One trial (460 participants) evaluated the effect of a questionnaire being received on a Monday, compared to being received on a Friday. There was no evidence for an effect on response of questionnaires being received on a Monday (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.56) (Analysis 75.1). One trial (1600 participants) evaluated the effect on response of using a padded envelope compared to a priority mail envelope. There was no evidence for an effect on response of using a padded envelope (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07) (Analysis 77.1).

A small trial (135 participants) evaluated the effect on response of the questionnaire being hand‐delivered by a person known to the recipient compared to standard postal delivery. The odds of response were more than doubled when the questionnaire was hand‐delivered by a known person (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.29 to 5.23) (Analysis 78.1). Two trials (937 participants) evaluated the effect on questionnaire response of hand delivery compared to postal delivery. There was no evidence overall that response was increased using hand delivery (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.50 to 4.15). There was considerable heterogeneity amongst the trial results (I² = 88%) (Analysis 79.1). One trial (199 participants) evaluated the effect on response of sending a postal questionnaire compared with sending it by fax. The odds of response were almost halved when sending by fax (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.14) (Analysis 80.2).

### Oral nicotine marketing claims in direct-mail advertising [^bffd8333]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 1 March 2018 and 31 August 2020, tobacco companies sent an estimated 38 million pieces of oral nicotine direct-mail advertisements to US consumer households for Velo (RJ Reynolds) and On! (Altria) nicotine pouches and Revel lozenges (RJ Reynolds). Most direct-mail in this sample was sent by Altria (n = 29 ads, 19.8 million pieces) versus RJ Reynolds (n = 21 ads, 18.2 million pieces). The majority of direct-mail advertisements featured nicotine pouches (n = 35 ads; 31.8 million pieces), while a smaller proportion featured lozenges (n = 15 ads; 6.2 million pieces).

Figure 1A displays the proportion of unique advertisements (black bar) and the proportion of total mail volume sent (grey bar) containing claims by category. Out of the 50 unique advertisements, 90% contained claims that oral nicotine was an alternative to another tobacco product like cigarettes, traditional smokeless products or e-cigarettes ('it's the nicotine you're used to without the chewing, smoking, spitting, odour'; 'forget about the lighters, chargers and all that other stuff') and 70% noted that the product could be used anywhere ('for everywhere you're headed'; 'anytime, anywhere'; 'discrete satisfaction'). Around half of ads contained claims that oral nicotine was spit-free (58%), smoke-free (42%) and did not contain tobacco leaf (42%, eg, 'tobacco-leaf free'; 'we took the simple approach of extracting nicotine from tobacco leaves').

### E-mail amplification of a mock code teaching round [^a8e6433c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether e-mail could be used to supplement a teaching round, we implemented the following educational intervention: each Monday, a mock code was presented. Two e-mails were then sent the same day to all residents. One summarized the main teaching points whereas the second solicited discussion. Each Friday, a third e-mail was sent that summarized the discussion. We collected all e-mails and surveyed the residents. Fifteen of 18 residents completed the questionnaire; two were not participants in the e-round. Forty percent (7/15) of the residents attended fewer than half of the mock codes but most participants (10/13) reported reading > 95% of the e-mails. A majority reported storing (11/13), printing (7/13), and reading e-mails a second time (12/13). Seven of 13 reported learning as much or more from the e-mails as from the mock code itself. We conclude that e-mail can increase learning from a traditional mock code teaching round.

### Investigation of bioterrorism-related anthrax, United States, 2001: epidemiologic findings [^a595a224]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

From our investigation, B. anthracis–positive powder appears capable of contaminating other mail during processing, leading to exposure and subsequent development of cutaneous and possibly inhalational anthrax. The risk from cross-contaminated mail appears to be extremely low; 85 million pieces of mail were processed at facilities in New Jersey and District of Columbia after the October 9 envelopes, and no additional anthrax cases were detected through stimulated enhanced hospital-based surveillance of 10.5 million people in metropolitan areas around those postal facilities. Although the risk for B. anthracis infection from cross-contaminated mail may be low, investigations of future bioterrorist attacks with B. anthracis–positive powders should consider the potential role of secondarily contaminated items in transmission of disease. An attack using a greater number of spore-containing envelopes would likely lead to many more cases due to cross-contaminated mail.

Throughout the investigation, various reporting mechanisms were used to enhance detection of cases, including prospective syndromic surveillance in emergency departments and intensive-care units, laboratory-based surveillance, networks of clinicians such as dermatologists, and worksite absenteeism monitoring. In general, most cases of anthrax were detected through reports from clinical laboratorians and clinicians and from patient self-reporting. The role of the news media in increasing patient, clinician, and laboratorian awareness of anthrax was likely an important factor in stimulating case detection and reporting. Health departments sent alerts to health-care providers and provided training seminars for clinicians to improve case detection. Before the bioterrorism-related anthrax cases in 2001, clinician recognition of clinical findings suggestive of cutaneous or inhalational anthrax is presumed to have been very low. For our investigation, cases in the first cluster associated with the September 18 mailing went unrecognized until B. anthracis was identified in a culture of cerebrospinal fluid from the index case in Florida, underscoring the critical role of the laboratory in initiating the investigation.

### Tobacco industry marketing: an analysis of direct mail coupons and giveaways [^81f7d38b]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite marketing prohibitions, tobacco company marketing expenditures in the USA have continued to grow with tobacco companies shifting focus towards point-of-sale-marketing and direct marketing to consumers through the mail and on the web. The purpose of this observational study was to investigate the content of direct marketing sent in response to registrations on select industry websites.

Methods

An analysis of 659 tobacco company direct mail marketing pieces received between July 2011 and June 2012 was conducted. Mailings were coded for type and value of tobacco coupons, type of tobacco products promoted with coupons and number and type of giveaways offered.

Results

The most common type of mailing was tobacco coupon distribution; 86.5% of the mailings contained at least one coupon. Mailings with coupons had an average estimated coupon value of $4.17. The total coupon value of each mailing varied by the type of coupon offer and product promoted. The Camel and Marlboro coupon mailings heavily promoted snus, with over half of Camel coupon mailings (60.9%) and nearly half (44.8%) of Marlboro coupon mailings promoting snus alone. In addition, 47.9% of Marlboro coupon mailings and 11.4% of Camel mailings promoted snus alongside cigarettes.

Discussion

Tobacco companies use direct mail marketing to communicate with consumers and provide valuable tobacco coupons. More research is needed to understand the content of these mailings and how they are used by tobacco consumers in order to develop effective policy solutions.

### Role of gut microbiota in statin-associated new-onset diabetes – A cross-sectional and prospective analysis of the FINRISK 2002 cohort [^91791377]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fecal Samples

Those willing to donate a fecal sample were given a sampling kit alongside detailed instructions and a prepaid postal parcel for returning the samples via mail. Samples were collected into 50-mL Falcon tubes without a stabilizing solution and mailed to the laboratory under typical Finnish winter conditions between Monday and Thursday. The samples were frozen immediately upon reception and stored unthawed at −20 °C until sequencing in 2017.

Sequencing was performed at the University of California, San Diego. Microbial DNA was extracted using a MagAttract PowerSoil kit (Qiagen). Library preparation was carried out using a miniaturized version of the Kapa HyperPlus Illumina-compatible preparation kit (Kapa Biosystems). Samples were normalized to 5 ng with an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handling robot followed by enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair, and adapter-ligation reactions performed with a Mosquito HV liquid handling robot (TTP Labtech, Inc). PCR-amplified and barcoded libraries were quantified using PicoGreen assay.

Sequencing adapters were based on the iTru protocoland sequencing itself was performed with an Illumina Hi-Seq 4000 (Illumina Inc.) for 150-bp reads. Average read count per sample was 900 000 reads. After removing human DNA reads by mapping them against the reference genome assembly GRCh38 using Bowtie2, the reads were classified taxonomically using SHOGUN v1.0.5by mapping them against bacterial and archaeal genomic sequences found in the NCBI RefSeq database Version 82 (May 8, 2017).

To quantify differences in community composition, we used Shannon index for alpha-diversity. Aitchison distance for beta-diversity, and centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed relative abundances for species-specific differential abundance comparisons. Relative abundances were calculated by scaling the raw counts to the total sum of reads. Alpha-diversity was calculated from unfiltered species-level raw counts. To exclude very rare taxa, the species-specific analyses were filtered to a core microbiota that included species with a minimum of 1% prevalence and a minimum of 0.01% relative abundance. The Aitchison distances were also broken down into principal components, of which the first 2 were chosen to be used in downstream analyses. Finally, all microbiota features were converted into Z scores before analysis when they were used in a predictor capacity.

### Oral nicotine marketing claims in direct-mail advertising [^4077fab3]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding how oral nicotine products (eg, nicotine pouches, lozenges) are marketed to consumers, including whether potential implicit reduced harm claims are used. In the current study, we explored the marketing claims present in a sample of direct-mail oral nicotine advertisements sent to US consumers (March 2018–August 2020).

Methods

Direct-mail ads (n = 50) were acquired from Mintel and dual-coded for the following claims: alternative to other tobacco products, ability to use anywhere, spit-free, smoke-free and product does not contain tobacco leaf. We merged the coded data with Mintel's volume estimate (number of mail pieces sent to consumers) and calculated the proportion of oral nicotine advertisements containing claims by category.

Results

Of the 38 million pieces of oral nicotine direct-mail sent to US consumers, most featured claims that the product could be used anywhere (84%, 31.8 million pieces); was an alternative to other tobacco products (69%, 26.1 million pieces); and did not contain tobacco leaf (eg, 'tobacco leaf-free', 'simple' approach of extracting nicotine from tobacco; 55%, 20.7 million pieces). A slightly smaller proportion contained claims that oral nicotine was 'spit-free' (52%, 19.8 million pieces) or 'smoke-free' (31%, 11.7 million pieces).

Conclusion

Our results provide an early indication of marketing claims used to promote oral nicotine. The strategies documented, particularly the use of language to highlight oral nicotine is tobacco-free, may covey these products as lower-risk to consumers despite the lack of evidence or proper federal authorisation that oral nicotine products are a modified-risk tobacco product. Future research is needed to examine consumer perceptions of such claims.

Baseline examination

The FINRISK 2002 survey included a self-administered questionnaire, physical measurements and collection of blood and stool samples. The questionnaire, together with an invitation to the health examination, was sent by mail to all subjects. Trained nurses carried out a physical examination and blood sampling in local health centres or other survey sites. The participants were advised to fast for ≥ 4 h and avoid heavy meals earlier during the day. The venous blood samples were centrifuged at the field survey sites, stored at −70 °C and transferred daily to the laboratory of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data for physiological measures, biomarkers, dietary factors, demographic factors and lifestyle factors was collected.

Stool sample collection

At the baseline examination, all willing participants were given a stool sampling kit with detailed instructions. The participants mailed their samples overnight between Monday and Thursday under Finnish winter conditions to the laboratory of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare where the samples were stored at −20 °C. The stool samples were stored unthawed until they were transferred in 2017 to the University of California San Diego for microbiome sequencing.

Stool DNA extraction and library preparation

A miniaturised version of the Kapa HyperPlus Illumina-compatible library prep kit (Kapa Biosystems) was used for library generation. DNA extracts were normalised to 5 ng total input per sample in an Echo 550 acoustic liquid-handling robot (Labcyte Inc). A Mosquito HV liquid-handling robot (TTP Labtech Inc. was used for 1/10 scale enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair and adapter-ligation reactions). Sequencing adapters were based on the iTru protocol, in which short universal adapter stubs are ligated first and then sample-specific barcoded sequences added in a subsequent PCR step. Amplified and barcoded libraries were then quantified by the PicoGreen assay and pooled in approximately equimolar ratios before being sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument to an average read count of ~900,000 reads per sample.

### Comparison of salt-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours between parents and caregivers of children under 18 years of age and other adults who do not care for children under 18 years of age in victoria, Australia [^6ff7be1c]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). High credibility.

Methodology

Study design and participant recruitment

This was a cross-sectional study completed in a sample of Victorian adults aged 18–65 years. Full details of the methodology have been described elsewhere. In brief, participants were recruited using three strategies: (1) across four shopping centres in Victoria, (2) a Facebook advertisement campaign and (3) an online consumer research panel (Global Market Insite (GMI) Lightspeed), from September through November 2015.

Participants from all recruitment strategies used Qualtrics (Provo, UT; 2018), an online survey software instrument, to complete a questionnaire assessing salt-related KABs. On the questionnaire, participants were asked to indicate if they were parents or caregivers of a child or children < 18 years of age. Responses included 'Yes, I'm a parent', 'Yes, I care for a child/children' or 'No'. In this analysis, the sample was stratified into those who responded as 'yes' defined as 'parents/caregivers of children < 18 years of age' (termed as parents) or those who responded as 'no' (termed as other adults). Of note, the group of other adults may or may not have children aged 18 years or over. In this analysis we are particularly interested in parents/caregivers of children under 18 years of age, rather than parents/caregivers of 'adult' children, because they are the nutritional gatekeepers of the family and have a major influence in determining the dietary behaviour of children.

All participants provided informed consent. Participants were offered a piece of fruit or a chocolate as an incentive for completing the survey.

Shopping centre recruitment and data collection

Data were primarily collected during the hours of 09:00–17:00, Monday to Saturday, from September to October 2015. However, to capture a broad representation of adults, recruitment also occurred on Sundays and during late-night shopping hours (Thursday evenings) at selected sites. To capture a representative spread of participants across different socioeconomic stratum, participants were recruited from shopping centres from geographical areas of varying socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage as indicated by the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas. Each shopping centre was allocated 5 days for recruitment and data collection. The researchers approached passing shoppers and invited them to participate in the study. Participants completed an intercept survey on an iPad.

### Supporting clinical rules engine in the adjustment of medication (SCREAM): protocol of a multicentre, prospective, randomised study [^91bc4f39]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Study design

The Supporting Clinical Rules Engine in the Adjustment of Medication (SCREAM) study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised study with a cluster group design. The randomisation will be per main nursing home physician and stratified per ward (somatic and psychogeriatric). This study will be blinded for physicians and for patients; physicians will be emphatically requested not to discuss with each other about the study to avoid bias. The study follows the CONSORT guidelines.

Overall study design

In order to use the CRR, the nursing homes will have to provide the medication list, the patient characteristics and the laboratory values for each patient in a digital format.

Taking into account the extra workload for the investigators, there will be a predefined day for each nursing home to send the files: nursing home A sends the files on Mondays, nursing home B sends the files on Tuesday, and so on.

All nursing homes will send the patient data both for control and intervention groups.

The randomisation will be performed by two of the authors (BvO, CMG). The randomisation will be per main nursing home physician and stratified per ward. Physician A will be randomised in the control group and physician B on the intervention group, taking into account that the amount of patients in each group should be approximately the same.

Intervention group

The datasets will be screened through the CRR on a weekly basis. The messages delivered by the CRR will be sent via mail to the specific physicians. Each remark will be sent on a separate mail in a standardised way. In response to the report, the physician will send a feedback message within 36 h indicating, in a standardised way, whether:
the advice was not followed
the advice was followed
the advice was changed.

After receiving this feedback, the investigators will process it in the CRR, in order to create the database for the study.

Additionally, regular care will be also applied. That is according to the Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate, a yearly medication review with a physician and a pharmacist, even though there is a substantial variation, For the centres included in this study there are no dedicated clinical pharmacist working in the nursing home.

### What's the healthiest day? circaseptan (weekly) rhythms in healthy considerations [^1fcf0b37]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Biological clocks govern numerous aspects of human health, including weekly clocks-called circaseptan rhythms-that typically include early-week spikes for many illnesses.

Purpose

To determine whether contemplations for healthy behaviors also follow circaseptan rhythms.

Methods

We assessed healthy contemplations by monitoring Google search queries (2005–2012) in the U.S. that included the word healthy and were Google classified as health-related (e.g., healthy diet). A wavelet analysis was used in 2013 to isolate the circaseptan rhythm, with the resulting series compared by estimating ratios of relative query volume (healthy versus all queries) each day (e.g., (Monday-Wednesday)/Wednesday).

Results

Healthy searches peaked on Monday and Tuesday, thereafter declining until rebounding modestly on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were statistically indistinguishable (t = 1.22, p = 0.22), but their combined mean had 30% (99% CI = 29, 32) more healthy queries than the combined mean for Wednesday-Sunday. Monday and Tuesday query volume was 3% (99% CI = 2, 5) greater than Wednesday, 15% (99% CI = 13, 17) greater than Thursday, 49% (99% CI = 46, 52) greater than Friday, 80% (99% CI = 76, 84) greater than Saturday, and 29% (99% CI = 27, 31) greater than Sunday. We explored media-based (priming) motivations for these patterns and they were consistently rejected.

Conclusions

Just as many illnesses have a weekly clock, so do healthy considerations. Discovery of these rhythms opens the door for a new agenda in preventive medicine, including implications for hypothesis development, research strategies to further explore these rhythms, and interventions to exploit daily cycles in healthy considerations.

### Pediatric resident engagement with an online critical care curriculum during the intensive care rotation [^530faa3f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We conducted a prospective cohort study examining junior (post-graduate year 2) resident use of online curricula during their first rotation in medical-surgical PICUs at two large academic children's hospitals (Boston Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital) that are similar in size, patient population, and resident scope of responsibility. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both sites. ICU resident rotation directors created individualized curricula for each site that covered core concepts in pediatric critical care medicine. Both sites also provided in-person educational experiences (bedside teaching, didactic lectures, and manikin-based simulations). Site 1 delivered in-person education between 07:30 and 08:15 every weekday, and Site 2 did so between 12:15 and 13:00 every Monday through Thursday. We administered the online curricula from July 2013 to June 2015 at Site 1 and June 2015 to June 2017 at Site 2. Neither site provided protected time for curriculum completion. Although residents were informed of the expectation to complete curricula by the end of their ICU rotation, there were no formal consequences for failing to complete. At both sites, residents were e-mailed 2 weeks before their rotation and instructed to complete the curriculum before the end of their ICU rotation, with e-mail reminders provided at rotation weeks 2, 3, and 4. Residents were excluded from the time-of-use analysis if their daily schedule data were unavailable.

Curricula were delivered on OPENPediatrics, which is based at Site 1. Each lesson contained a pretest, video, and posttest. The curriculum contained 18 lessons at Site 1 and 21 lessons at Site 2. Individual lesson videos ranged in length from 4 to 36 minutes (average length 18 min). The total curriculum video duration at Site 1 was 5 hours, 12 minutes and at Site 2 was 6 hours, 50 minutes. The website required strictly linear progress; a pretest, then video, then posttest for each lesson needed to be completed before a resident could progress to the next lesson. Residents were only able to take the pretest once, but posttests could be attempted multiple times until the minimum passing score (≥ 80%) was achieved. The platform allowed residents to stop and restart within pre- or posttests, as well as within videos, if they did not complete a given item in one sitting.

### Variation and prognostic potential of the gut antibiotic resistome in the FINRISK 2002 cohort [^bf4eba07]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Baseline examination

The FINRISK 2002 survey included a self-administered questionnaire, physical measurements, and blood and stool sample collection. The questionnaire and an invitation to the health examination were mailed to all subjects. Trained nurses conducted physical examinations and blood sampling in local health centers or other survey sites. The participants were advised to fast for ≥ 4 h and avoid heavy meals earlier during the day. The venous blood samples were centrifuged at the field survey sites, stored at −70 °C, and transferred daily to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare laboratory. Data was collected for physiological measures, biomarkers, dietary, demographic, and lifestyle factors.

Stool sample collection

All willing participants were given a stool sampling kit at the baseline examination with detailed instructions. The participants mailed their samples overnight between Monday and Thursday under Finnish winter conditions to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare laboratory, where they were stored at −20 °C. The stool samples were transferred frozen in 2017 to the University of California, San Diego, for microbiome sequencing.

Stool DNA extraction and library preparation

A miniaturized version of the Kapa HyperPlus Illumina-compatible library prep kit (Kapa Biosystems) was used for library generation. DNA extracts were normalized to 5 ng total input per sample in an Echo 550 acoustic liquid-handling robot (Labcyte Inc.). A Mosquito HV liquid-handling robot (TTP Labtech Inc.) was used for 1/10 scale enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair, and adapter-ligation reactions. Sequencing adapters were based on the iTru protocol, in which short universal adapter stubs are ligated first, and then sample-specific barcoded sequences are added in a subsequent PCR step. Amplified and barcoded libraries were then quantified by the PicoGreen assay and pooled in approximately equimolar ratios before being sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument to an average read count of ~900,000 reads per sample. 107 negative controls were sequenced with the samples. The metagenomic data are available from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (accession number).

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^63eb97b8]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Best and worst day combinations at different minimum days for reliable dietary assessment of different nutrients/food groups.

For each nutrient and at each number of days, the day combinations which yielded the highest (in color) and lowest ICC scores (in gray) are shown. The plot is ranged between ICC values of 0.75–1.0, with the ICC reliability threshold at 0.9 shown as a red line - points lying below this range are not shown.

A 3-day combination of Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday precisely reached the 0.9 reliability threshold for meat intake. Notably, when extending the collection period to 4 days, even the least optimal combination - consisting of four consecutive days - surpassed this threshold. This suggests that any 4-day period within a week is sufficient to accurately capture an individual's meat consumption patterns. For dairy intake, the least optimal combination at 3 days, consisting of two weekend days, had exactly reached the 0.9 threshold, while the best combination consisted of Monday, Tuesday and Sunday. Bread consumption needed 4 days for its best combination to surpass the 0.9 threshold. The collective vegetables and fruit group required just 3 days for the worst day combination to reach the threshold, while the best combination included only weekdays (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday).

### Effect of mailing nicotine patches on tobacco cessation among adult smokers: a randomized clinical trial [^2b5c6947]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is well demonstrated in clinical trials in which NRT is accompanied by behavioral support. Epidemiologic data, however, indicate that people using NRT are no more likely to successfully quit smoking than those who do not use NRT.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of mailing nicotine patches to smokers without behavioral support on quit success rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-blinded, 2-group randomized clinical trial of adult smokers recruited across Canada by random-digit dialing of home and cell telephone numbers from June 4, 2012, through June 26, 2014. Follow-up was completed on January 5, 2015, and data were analyzed from May 24, 2015, through July 6, 2015. A total of 2093 individuals who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were interviewed at baseline and asked if they would be hypothetically interested in receiving nicotine patches by mail to quit smoking. Those who were interested and deemed eligible to participate (no contraindications to NRT) were randomized to the experimental group to be mailed a 5-week supply of nicotine patches or to a control group. Telephone follow-ups were conducted at 8 weeks and 6 months.

Interventions

Participants in the experimental group were sent a 5-week course of nicotine patches by expedited postal mail (3 weeks of step 1 [21 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 2 [14 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 3 [7 mg of nicotine], no behavioral support provided). Participants randomized to the control group were not offered the nicotine patches or any other intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day smoking abstinence at 6 months.

Results

Of the 2093 participants who were interviewed as part of the baseline survey (76.5% response rate), 1000 were found eligible for the trial and randomized to a group. Analyses were conducted on 500 participants in the experimental group (mean [SD] age, 48.0 [12.8] years; 255 female [51.0%]) and 499 in the control group (mean [SD] age, 49.7 [12.7] years; 256 female [51.3%]). Self-reported abstinence rates were significantly higher among participants who were sent nicotine patches compared with the control group (30-day abstinence: 38 [7.6%] of 500 vs 15 [3.0%] of 499; odds ratio, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.44–4.89; P = 0.002). Usable saliva samples were returned by only 50.9% of the participants. Biochemically validated abstinence at 6 months was found in 14 (2.8%) of 500 participants in the experimental group vs 5 (1.0%) of 499 in the control group (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.02–7.96; P = 0.046).

Conclusions and Relevance

The trial provides evidence of the effectiveness of mailed nicotine patches without behavioral support to promote tobacco cessation. The strength of these findings is tempered by the lack of biochemical validation for all participants.

### Increased double product on monday morning during work [^654313aa]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

It has been reported that cardiovascular events, and strokeoften occur on Mondays, especially in non-hospitalizedactive working populations younger than 65 years old. In addition, these cardiovascular events are recognized mostly during the morning. Because hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk, we examined whether blood pressure (BP) is elevated on Monday, especially in the morning during work.

### The pain course: a randomised controlled trial examining an internet-delivered pain management program when provided with different levels of clinician support [^3fa47d89]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

3.9. Time spent and summary of contacts

Significant differences were found between the Treatment Groups in the amount of clinician time required (F = 240.67, P < 0.001) with the Regular Contact Group requiring more time than both the Optional Contact and No Contact Groups (P < 0.001) and the No Contact Group requiring less time than the Optional Contact Group (P = 0.02). The mean total clinician time per participant for the Regular Contact Group over the 8 weeks of the course was 67.69 minutes (SD = 33.50), which comprised answering and making calls (Total = 890; M = 6.40; SD = 2.84; range: 1–12) as well as reading, sending, and responding to secure e-mails (Total = 783; M = 5.63; SD = 2.39; range: 0–11). Fifty-six percent (76/135) and 39% (48/123) of participants in the Optional Contact and No Contact Groups received 1 or more contacts through e-mail or telephone during the course, respectively. The mean total clinician time per participant for the Optional Contact Group was 12.85 minutes (SD = 24.61), which comprised answering and making calls (Total = 100; M = 0.74; SD = 1.28; range: 0–8) as well as reading, sending, and responding to secure e-mails (Total = 104; M = 0.77; SD = 1.08; range: 0–5). The mean total clinician time per participant in the No Contact Group was 5.44 minutes (SD = 12.38), which comprised answering and making calls (Total = 30; M = 0.24; SD = 0.657; range: 0–4) as well as reading, sending, and responding to e-mails (Total = 75; M = 0.61; SD = 1.02; range: 0–4). However, this contact was focussed on assessing and managing mental health crises rather than the provision of treatment or course-related clinical support. An additional 20.34 minutes (SD = 6.66; range: 5 minutes to 50 minutes) was required on average per participant to conduct the initial assessment through telephone before participation in the course.

### Committee opinion no. 653: concerns regarding social media and health issues in adolescents and young adults [^541a8f03]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Sexting — definition, prevalence, associated behaviors, and legal/clinical considerations: Sexting is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or suggestive images by cell phone, and a 2008 survey showed that 19% of females (aged 13–19 years) and 32% of women (aged 20–26 years) had sent nude or seminude pictures, with 31% of the former group and 46% of the latter having received such pictures. Among college-aged individuals, those reporting sexting were more likely to report other high-risk behaviors, including multiple sexual partners over the past 3 months, unprotected sex, sex after alcohol or drug use, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher likelihood of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Legal risks are noted, as the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act prohibits visual depiction of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and, under current child pornography laws, the dissemination of images of a juvenile to another person is prohibited and can result in prosecution. The gynecologist's office is a setting for routine discussion of sexual health, providing an opportunity to educate adolescents or young adults and to encourage guardians to monitor text and e-mail use, and monitoring or limiting an adolescent's text messaging has been linked to low incidence of sexting.

### Parent-adolescent communication in a digital world: a 100-day diary study [^b4d578c7]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Daily diary

During 100 consecutive days, from January to May 2023, participants received one questionnaire a day via the m‐Path app. The micro‐questionnaires were sent at 8.30 p.m. and could be started until midnight. Reminders were sent at 9.15 and 10.00 p.m. if adolescents had not completed the questionnaire. Each questionnaire consisted of 34 to 38 questions, depending on the number of follow‐up questions. After the 100 days, participants could decide to extend their participation up to 15 days to catch up for missed days.

We monitored participants' compliance daily and answered any participant questions or problems via WhatsApp, telephone, and e‐mail. Participants were messaged regularly via WhatsApp to motivate them. For instance, we updated them weekly on their response rates of the previous week. Generally, when participants missed three and four questionnaires in a row, we contacted them via WhatsApp to check whether they were experiencing any technical issues. If participants missed approximately a week of questionnaires, we called them to check whether there were any technical issues or whether we could help to motivate them.

Incentives

Adolescents received compensation for each phase of the study, except for the optional interview. Adolescents received €5,‐ for the intake interview, €5,‐ for completing the baseline questionnaire, and €1,‐ for each completed daily diary questionnaire. Participants who completed 100 questionnaires or more (including catch‐up days) received an additional €10,‐. In the middle of the study, participants could earn a €5,‐ bonus by completing 14 consecutive questionnaires in a row (Day 47 until 60). In addition, each Tuesday, we raffled two times €25,‐ based on compliance of the previous week. Participants were paid every month of the study.

### Impact of sending email reminders of the legal requirement for posting results on clinicalTrials.gov: cohort embedded pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^11d26ce1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Intervention

The experimental intervention consisted of sending reminders of the FDAAA 801 requirement through personalized emails to responsible parties of the randomly selected trials. The emails were constructed as surveys, notifying responsible parties of trials that the primary completion date was over a year old and asking for the reasons why they had not posted results on the register (see supplementary appendix). In fact the survey was a "cover" for the reminder. The personalized emails were automatically generated to include the title and the personal NCT number of the trial. The subject of the email was "Posting of basic results". The emails reminded the recipient that according to the FDAAA 801, the results of their trial should have been posted. The email outlined reasons for posting, including whether responsible parties were aware of the risk of civil penalties (up to $10 000 a day) and withholding of grant funds for federally funded trials if they failed to comply with this requirement. Emails were signed by the last author of the current study, indicating his affiliation (Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health). The emails were sent on 29 August 2012 to all responsible parties of trials as indicated in ClinicalTrials.gov (sponsors or principal investigators). A similar reminder was systematically sent at day 7 and at two and five months (see supplementary appendix).

Outcomes and measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of trials for which results were posted on ClinicalTrials.gov at three months. The secondary outcome was this proportion at six months.

Because of the quality control process of ClinicalTrials.gov, there is a delay between the posting of results by responsible parties and the day that the results appear as posted on the website. The date and "first received date" are publicly available on the website. Consequently, we extracted these data a posteriori on 18 July 2013 for the whole cohort. This extraction was done independently in duplicate by two assessors who were blinded to the allocated intervention. All disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus.

### How many days of pedometer monitoring predict weekly physical activity in adults? [^b887d3b5]. Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The study purpose was to establish the number (and type) of days needed to estimate mean pedometer-determined steps/day in a field setting.

Methods

Seven days of data were collected from 90 participants (33 males, age = 49.1 ± 16.2 years, BMI = 27.2 ± 4.1 kg/m²; 57 females, age = 44.8 ± 16.9 years, BMI = 27.0 ± 5.9 kg/m²). Mean steps/day were computed for all 7 days (the criterion), each single day, and combinations of days. Analyses included repeated measures ANOVA, intra-class correlations (ICC), and regression.

Results

There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between days. The difference was limited to Sunday and accounted for 5% of the variance. ICC analyses indicated a minimum of 3 days is necessary to achieve a reliability of 0.80. The adjusted R² was 0.79 for a single day (specifically Wednesday), 0.89 for 2 days (Wednesday, Thursday), and 0.94 for 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday). Sunday was the last day to enter the model.

Conclusions

Although there is a statistical difference between days, there is little practical difference, and the primary distinction appears limited to Sunday. Although a single day of collection is not acceptable, any 3 days can provide a sufficient estimate.

### Return to galen [^727bdc3c]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

AT THE BEGINNING of the previous century, the English editor of a minor work by Galen called for a return to that ancient scholar after centuries of neglect. The appeal did not meet with success. Galen's reputation is currently based on renown arising from tradition, rather than an awareness of his actual contributions to medical science. His methodological approach to experimental medicine seems to have fallen into obscurity, although it anticipated modern principles. This report reviews the rise and fall in popularity of Galen's medical works, in an attempt to highlight the circumstances that still prevent a full appreciation of those writings.

### Reporting of MMR evidence in professional publications: 1988–2007 [^3e73e368]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Results

The majority of comment pieces were published in Pulse (65.7%, n = 565). The BMJ published 104 comment pieces (12.1%). Practice Nurse and Nursing Standard both published 61 pieces (7%), Community Practitioner published 45 (5.2%) and Health Visitor 24 (2.7) pieces. The most common article type was news articles (n = 657, 76.3%) followed by feature (n = 99, 11.5%), review (n = 40, 4.6%) commentary (n = 35, 4.0) and editorial (n = 29, 3.3%) pieces.

A time line detailing key events in relation to MMR is available from the authors. An initial peak in the number of commentaries in 1988 covering the introduction of MMR into the CIP was followed by an apparent reduction in interest until 1994, when the Department of Health introduced the school-based "MR catch-up"campaign, "Operation Safeguard"(fig 1). In 1998 there was another peak following the publication of Wakefield et al 's paper. In 2000, despite growing public concerns and widespread media coverage, fewer than 20 comment pieces were published, and in 2001 the debate became further politicised, illustrated by media debate about whether the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, should reveal whether his baby son, Leo, had received the MMR vaccination. Media interest continued until 2005, declining thereafter.

Trends in the main focus and tone of comment pieces

The most common focus of the 860 comment pieces was on the delivery of the CIP programme (n = 122; 14%). Most (n = 109; 12.6%) were published in Pulse. There were 75 comment pieces whose main focus was on endorsing MMR vaccination, while 50 (5.8%) primarily focused on potential adverse side effects.

Less than a quarter of comment pieces (n = 196, 22.7%) offered advice or recommendations. In the two-year period following the publication of the Wakefield paper in 1998 there were very few comment pieces containing recommendations, perhaps reflecting general uncertainty about MMR evidence among the editorial teams of these journals and magazines. Recommendations appeared more commonly during 2001 and 2002, although they still featured in only a minority of comment pieces.

### HPV self-sampling among long-term non-attenders to cervical cancer screening in Norway: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^24c1a0bc]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In the opt-in arm, 403 out of 1897 (21.2%) women ordered a self-sample, of which 144 (35.7%) ordered after receiving a reminder, and 250 (13.2%) returned the self-sample for analysis. Opt-in orders were made by ordinary mail (51.6%), web (33.0%), e-mail (14.2%) or telephone to the study centre (1.2%; not presented as an option in the invitation letter). Among 445 women in the send-to-all arm who submitted a self-sample, 254 (57.1%) did so after receiving a reminder.

Self-sampling increased total participation in all age groups and screening history categories. Total participation was consistently highest in the send-to-all arm, intermediate in the opt-in arm and lowest in the control arm (Table 2a). In each arm, total participation was highest in the youngest age group (age 36–45 years), at 8.0%, 18.5% and 32.9% among controls, opt-in and send-to-all, respectively, and tended to decrease with age (P-trend in total participation by age group: 0.001, 0.15 and 0.002 for controls, opt-in and send-to-all, respectively). Participation generally decreased with increasing time since last screening test, and this pattern was evident for both clinician sampling and self-sampling, and in each intervention arm (P-trend in total participation by time since last screening test (10–15 years, 16–28 years or never screened): < 0.0001, < 0.0001 and 0.004 for controls, opt-in and send-to-all, respectively). Among women who never had been screened previously, total participation was 1.9% for controls, 11.4% for opt-in and 25.0% for send-to-all (P < 0.0001). Also, the RPD was highest among never-screeners, at 6.1 (95% CI 3.4–11.1), 13.4 (95% CI 7.5–23.8) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.7–2.8) for opt-in vs. controls, send-to-all vs. controls and send-to-all vs. opt-in, respectively (Table 2b).

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^1a3947b6]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

For individuals aged 35 years or younger (Supplementary Fig. 1A), carbohydrate consumption pattern was similar to the overall study population, with significant increases on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday (+15 g, +30 g and +18 g respectively, p < 0.001). Interestingly, these significant increments were also seen for other weekdays for the older age group, with an increase of about 11 g from Tuesday to Thursday (p < 0.05), shown in Supplementary Fig. 1B. Eaten quantity for the younger age group changed significantly over the weekend with the exception of Sunday where it decreased (−90 g, p < 0.01). In the age group 50+, this increase was not significant for any other days. Fruit consumption significantly increased during the weekend (between 35 and 40 g) as well among the older age participants. Note that fruit consumption in this study comprises consumption of both fruit juices and whole fruits, which might explain why the younger age group displayed a much higher baseline for this food category. Converse to the previous nutrient trends, intake of non-alcoholic beverages such as coffee and water decreased significantly, particularly during the weekend (all p < 0.001) in the younger age group, while this difference was either non-significant (coffee, tea and non-alcoholic beverages) or not as significant (water, p < 0.05) in the older age group. Vegetable consumption on Saturday and Sunday also decreased (−33 g and −28 g, p < 0.01) significantly in the younger age group but non-significantly in the older age group.

### Daily newspaper view of dengue fever epidemic, athens, Greece, 1927–1931 [^72c74006]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

One article cited a different newspaper claiming that the epidemic was not in fact DF but, rather, yellow fever. Two unnamed physicians asked for their opinion were cited as saying that if the disease were yellow fever, mortality rates would have been much higher. Initial reports on the epidemic in mid-August claimed that, compared with 1927, the new DF outbreak was much more malignant, on the basis of the lack of deaths reported during the previous year. I Kathimerini acknowledged the possibility that some deaths might have occurred in 1927 but, because of the previous ill health of the patients, could have been attributed to other causes.

The second month of the outbreak saw qualitatively different articles. Small news pieces about the everyday effects of the epidemic appeared frequently: entrance examinations to the universities were postponed, the army draft was deferred, theaters were closed, spouses and children were sent to resorts far from Athens, courts were closed because of the lack of judges and jurors, and the mode of taxation was changed to address lower income. Brief articles reported numbers of DF cases from Athens and elsewhere, including non-Greek cities such as Smyrna (now Ismir), Copenhagen, and Berlin, attributed to travelers from Greece. In mid-September, I Kathimerini reported that the epidemic was clearly weaker: ". the crowd at the horse races was again high after several weeks of low attendance". On the same day, a 12-word item bore the headline, "ONLY TWO DEATHS!" On September 22, I Kathimerini published a report of the Ministries of National Economy and Health about the total number of deaths caused by the epidemic, aimed at calming foreigners wishing to travel to Greece. The numbers were corrected slightly a few days later, but the overall picture did not change (Figure). I Kathimerini did not subsequently publish new numbers of fatal cases.

### Is e-mail communication effective in changing ordering patterns in the emergency department? A case study of computed tomography for pulmonary embolus [^f96f4a23]. Academic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of e-mail communication to reduce the utilization of computed tomography for pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) in young patients (aged 40 and under) in our institution.

Materials and Methods

An e-mail was sent to all of our institution's emergency department (ED) physicians in response to a series of negative PE studies in young females. The periods 90 days before and 90 days after were evaluated to assess the total number of PE studies performed in patients aged 40 and younger, the rate of positivity, and the utilization of D-dimer and ventilation/perfusion scans during each period.

Results

Over the 180-day period, a total of 65 PE studies were ordered in patients aged 40 and younger in the ED. Studies were positive for PE in 1 of 33 (3%) before the e-mail and 4 of 32 (12.5%) after (P = 0.343). There was no difference in the number of D-dimer studies ordered during each period for patients studied with computed tomography. Ventilation/perfusion scanning was not performed on any ED patients younger than 40 during the 180-day period.

Conclusions

One-time e-mail communication was not effective in changing ED ordering habits of PE studies. Scant information exists in regard to effective clinician-to-clinician communication. Further evaluation for successful mechanisms to promote health practice reform and quality improvement is necessary.

### A mixed methods study of the impact of consultant overnight working in an english emergency department [^6994a95c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Quantitative results

Total time in department

In the 54 months studied there were 186 500 adult Monday to Thursday ED attendances. A total of 43 105 (23.1%) of these were between the hours of 22:00 and 06:00. There were 26 780 (62.1%) adult attendances overnight in the 34 months prior to the introduction of a consultant overnight and 16 325 (37.9%) in the 20 months afterwards.

Figure 1A, B illustrates the raw monthly time series and fitted ITS model for total time in department, respectively. Prior to the intervention, the average total time in department during the day (06:00–22:00) Monday to Thursday was 202 min (95% CI 197 to 206) with a small significant increase over time (a slope of 0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8 min/month, p < 0.001). Average total time overnight was higher by 44 min (95% CI 38 to 50, p < 0.001); with no substantive difference in trend from the day (−0.2; 95% CI −0.6 to 0.1, p = 0.134). Following the introduction of a consultant overnight, there was no significant change in average time in department overnight relative to the day (−12 min; 95% CI −28 to 4, p = 0.148) and no significant change in trend (0.5, 95% CI −0.6 to 1.6, p = 0.382). The model was robust to a range of sensitivity analyses including adjustment for influential points in the winter of 2016/2017, monthly patient numbers and alternative autocorrelation structures. See the online supplementary appendix for full model output and details of sensitivity analyses.

### Methods for obtaining unpublished data [^903e12f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In order to minimise publication bias, authors of systematic reviews often spend considerable time trying to obtain unpublished data. These include data from studies conducted but not published (unpublished data), as either an abstract or full-text paper, as well as missing data (data available to original researchers but not reported) in published abstracts or full-text publications. The effectiveness of different methods used to obtain unpublished or missing data has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different methods for obtaining unpublished studies (data) and missing data from studies to be included in systematic reviews.

Search Methods

We identified primary studies comparing different methods of obtaining unpublished studies (data) or missing data by searching the Cochrane Methodology Register (Issue 1, 2010), MEDLINE and EMBASE (1980 to 28 April 2010). We also checked references in relevant reports and contacted researchers who were known or who were thought likely to have carried out relevant studies. We used the Science Citation Index and PubMed 'related articles' feature to identify any additional studies identified by other sources (19 June 2009).

Selection Criteria

Primary studies comparing different methods of obtaining unpublished studies (data) or missing data in the healthcare setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of unpublished studies (data) or missing data obtained, as defined and reported by the authors of the included studies. Two authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using a standardised data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

Six studies met the inclusion criteria; two were randomised studies and four were observational comparative studies evaluating different methods for obtaining missing data. Methods to obtain missing dataFive studies, two randomised studies and three observational comparative studies, assessed methods for obtaining missing data (i.e. data available to the original researchers but not reported in the published study). Two studies found that correspondence with study authors by e-mail resulted in the greatest response rate with the fewest attempts and shortest time to respond. The difference between the effect of a single request for missing information (by e-mail or surface mail) versus a multistage approach (pre-notification, request for missing information and active follow-up) was not significant for response rate and completeness of information retrieved (one study). Requests for clarification of methods (one study) resulted in a greater response than requests for missing data. A well-known signatory had no significant effect on the likelihood of authors responding to a request for unpublished information (one study). One study assessed the number of attempts made to obtain missing data and found that the number of items requested did not influence the probability of response. In addition, multiple attempts using the same methods did not increase the likelihood of response. METHODS TO OBTAIN UNPUBLISHED STUDIES: One observational comparative study assessed methods to obtain unpublished studies (i.e. data for studies that have never been published). Identifying unpublished studies ahead of time and then asking the drug industry to provide further specific detail proved to be more fruitful than sending of a non-specific request.

Authors' Conclusions

Those carrying out systematic reviews should continue to contact authors for missing data, recognising that this might not always be successful, particularly for older studies. Contacting authors by e-mail results in the greatest response rate with the fewest number of attempts and the shortest time to respond.

### Notes from the field: public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 transmission during the April 7, 2020, election-city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, March 13-may 5, 2020 [^8a9c8337]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Wisconsin was the first state to hold an election with in-person voting after stay-at-home orders were issued to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The statewide primary election, held on April 7, 2020, occurred fewer than 2 weeks after the statewide "Safer at Home" order * became effective on March 25.

On March 3, 2020, CDC published interim guidance to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 at polling locations. Mitigation measures in line with the CDC guidance and additional measures were implemented in the city of Milwaukee (in Milwaukee County) to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at in-person polling venues (Supplementary Table). In addition to the nearly 500 poll workers, election inspectors, and chief inspectors, Milwaukee city health department personnel and the Wisconsin National Guard were assigned to support mitigation efforts at each of five Milwaukee polling sites and the central count location. Mitigation measures implemented at the direction of the city health department complemented public messaging campaigns to encourage absentee voting. According to the Milwaukee Election Commission, comparing the number of persons voting in the spring of 2016 with those voting in the spring of 2020, the percentage of persons who voted by absentee mail-in ballots increased approximately fifteenfold, from 4.1% (6,874) to 68.0% (64,750) of voters; those who voted early (either in person or curbside [i.e. voting while remaining in their vehicle or at the voting place entrance]) increased by 160%, from 4.7% (7,949) to 12.2% (11,612). Although the proportion of those who voted in person on election day decreased 78%, from 91.2% (153,458) to 19.8% (18,806), † local news media reported long waiting times at Milwaukee voting locations on election day. § Overall, the number of persons who voted decreased 43%, from 168,281 to 95,168, and the number of polling sites decreased from 181 to five.

### The cost-effectiveness of opt-in and send-to-all HPV self-sampling among long-term non-attenders to cervical cancer screening in Norway: the equalscreen randomized controlled trial [^7e29c443]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of mailing a human papillomavirus self-sampling (HPV-ss) kit, directly or via invitation to order, compared with mailing reminder letters among long-term non-attenders in Norway.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis using the Equalscreen study data with 6000 women aged 35–69 years who had not screened in 10+ years. Participants were equally randomized into three arms: reminder letter (control); invitation to order HPV-ss kit (opt-in); directly mailed HPV-ss kit (send-to-all). Cost-effectiveness (2020 Great British Pounds (GBP)) was estimated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per additional screened woman, and per additional cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) from extended and direct healthcare perspectives.

Results

Participation, CIN2+ detection, and total screening costs were highest in the send-to-all arm, followed by the opt-in and control arms. Non-histological physician appointments contributed to 67% of the total costs in the control arm and ≤ 31% in the self-sampling arms. From an expanded healthcare perspective, the ICERs were 135 GBP and 169 GBP per additional screened woman, and 2864 GBP and 4165 GBP per additional CIN2+ detected for the opt-in and send-to-all, respectively.

Conclusions

Opt-in and send-to-all self-sampling were more effective and, depending on willingness-to-pay, may be considered cost-effective alternatives to improve screening attendance in Norway.

### Microenterprise intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and HIV preventive practices among economically-vulnerable African-American young adults (EMERGE): a feasibility randomized clinical trial [^12656120]. AIDS and Behavior (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Participants assigned to the experimental intervention received the following: (1) one text message each week on job openings in Baltimore, appropriate for young adults at or slightly above or below high school diploma or equivalent training. Text messages on job announcements were sent every Monday at 6PM; (2) one 2-h educational session each week on business start-up and HIV prevention on Wednesdays at 10:30AM or 3:00PM in a classroom at the CBO resource center with a PowerPoint presentation, handouts, group discussions, guest speakers, small-group activities, and completion of the session and participant checklists. The sessions were led by three female facilitators. A text message reminder to attend the educational session was sent 2 h prior to the session; (3) one mentor during the intervention period, who was aged 25 and older, lived in the Baltimore greater metropolitan area, owned a small business in Baltimore, and spoke English. Mentors included men and women who were matched according to the microbusiness interests of the participants; (4) one microbusiness start-up grant (repayment not required) in the amount of $1100.00 paid by check in a series of small payments over the study period and used for purchasing microbusiness supplies, marketing, communication, and travel. Participants were required to attend educational sessions, complete weekly text message surveys, and provide evidence of prior microbusiness purchases (e.g. receipts, goods, photos, etc.) to receive the next small payment; and (5) three text messages each week on microenterprise and HIV prevention, delivered every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 6PM to reiterate key messages from the educational sessions. In a larger effectiveness trial, the experimental intervention was hypothesized to work to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors by building skills and providing motivational messaging and financial support.

### Improving weekend patient handover [^398d7a3f]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The Royal College of Physicians state that 'handover, particularly of temporary 'on-call' responsibility, has been identified as a point at which errors are likely to occur' [1]. Working a weekend on-call covering medical wards is often busy and stressful for all junior doctors, with added pressure in trying to identify patients and tasks amongst several different pieces of paper and making important care escalation. All handover sheets from a random weekend were collected and studied. Only 57% of patients listed had the minimum expected 3 patient identifiers [2] included and just 11% had any indication of escalation planning. They were also often written on scrap pieces of paper and included varying levels of relevant patient background and information. After liaison with junior doctors and the handover committee, involving senior medical clinicians, a new handover sheet was created and uploaded onto the trust intranet, to rectify some of the problems identified. Junior doctors were also educated about the changes to weekend handover. At 2 months post-introduction, another set of weekend handover sheets were collected. All medical wards used the handover sheets for documentation of patients and tasks at a weekend and inclusion of 3 patient identifiers rose to 80%. There was also a big increase noted in clinical information and background included at weekend handover and anecdotally made weekend handover easier and less stressful. There was also increased consideration of escalation planning. The handover sheet is now being rolled out trust-wide in medicine and introduced to surgical colleagues.

### Using music as a tool for distress reduction during cancer chemotherapy treatment [^bfd0c17f]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Design

The study used a randomized two-arm pre-post design. As the intervention could not be feasibly blinded to the control arm, day-based permuted block randomization was used. All participants who enrolled in the study on an intervention day (ie, music day) were assigned to the intervention arm, while those who enrolled on a control day (ie, nonmusic day) were assigned to the control arm. At the Karmanos infusion center, most of patients receive week-based chemotherapy on either Tuesday or Thursday. Therefore, two day-based randomized block designs were used. The first block (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) was randomized across 2 weeks with a weighted block size of 3 (first week: 2 intervention days and 1 control day, and second week: 1 intervention day and 2 control days). The second block (Tuesday and Thursday) was randomized every week with block size of 2. As all six sites were expected to have a similar distribution of patients per day, the same day-based randomized block design was used across sites.

The accrual target was set at 750 participants (ie, 375 per group). Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, the power for primary outcomes was justified with 674 participants (ie, 337 per group) using an unpaired t -test. This number assumed a small effect size (d = 0.2) with > 95% power to detect a true difference between two groups when a two-sided unpaired t -test was used at a P ≤ 5% significance level. Even applying a Bonferroni multiple comparison correction for up to 10 variables, a sample size of 674 participants had > 80% power to detect a true difference using a two-sided 0.5% (5%/10) level.

Post-acute care for suicide risk — We suggest sending patients periodic caring communications (e.g., postal mail, text messages), in addition to usual care, for 12 months following hospitalization related to suicide risk to reduce the risk of suicide attempts. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against offering brief contact interventions (e.g., telephonic interventions, crisis cards, World Health Organization Brief Intervention and Contact treatment modality) in addition to usual care following discharge from the emergency department to reduce the risk of suicide attempts.

### Randomised controlled trial evaluation of tweet2Quit: a social network quit-smoking intervention [^605028d3]. Tobacco Control (2017). Low credibility.

Sustained abstinence was recorded if a participant responded to the 7, 30 and 60 day surveys, and consistently (across both questions) reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence, that is, not smoking for the prior 7 days. Sustained abstinence was the designated end point because it was the more rigorous end point, and the sample was recruited as motivated to quit. Non-sustained abstinence was recorded if a participant reported smoking on any survey, regardless of the number of surveys completed, otherwise, lost to follow-up was recorded (25/160, 15.6%). The timing of the abstinence surveys was based on the quit dates that participants had recorded on the study website. If no quit date was recorded, the last possible date was used.

Supplemental online surveys at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit date measured how many days participants used nicotine patches, and how many times they visited smokefree.gov (survey completion rates are in the online supplementary material). Tweet2Quit tweeting methods (eg, phone, computer) were also assessed among intervention participants. Setting a quit date and posting an image for the Tweet2Quit user profile were determined visually on the study website.

Finally, tweets were automatically downloaded daily into a database that listed each tweet, the date and time sent, the verbatim message sent, the sender's username, and each recipient's username if designated (eg, by @). Engagement, measured at the participant level, was assessed using three metrics: (1) tweet volume (ie, number of tweets each participant sent); (2) days of tweeting (ie, number of days a participant sent at least one tweet) and (3) tweeting duration, which compared the participant's very first and last tweet dates.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^7758cc73]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

In the original review version and in the prior update versions (Edwards 2003; Edwards 2007; Edwards 2009), we focused on the integrity of allocation concealment and two authors independently scored methodological quality on the scale used by Schulz (Schulz 1995) as shown below, assigning 'A' to best quality and 'C' to poorest quality:

A ‐ trials deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation (i.e. central randomisation; computer‐generated address labels; or other description that contained elements that would ensure concealment);
B ‐ trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the other categories;
C‐ trials in which concealment was inadequate (such as alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth).

Where the methods used to conceal allocation were not clearly reported, the study authors were contacted, if possible, for clarification. We then compared the scores allocated and resolved differences by discussion.
For the current third update version, the risk of bias judgements from the original review and its subsequent updates were carried over (Edwards 2003; Edwards 2007; Edwards 2009), and two authors used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins 2011) to assess the risk of bias for each newly added study as 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' risk of bias for the seven domains below:

Sequence generation;
Allocation concealment;
Blinding of participants and personnel;
Blinding of outcome assessment;
Incomplete outcome data;
Selective reporting;
Other sources of bias.

We reported the results relating to allocation concealment in all the studies included in this update, and results relating to the other domains for the newly added studies only.

### Happy birthday? An observational study [^e3b40e80]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies show contradictory findings on the relationship between birthday and deathday, in particular whether people postpone death until after their birthday. We examine the phenomenon in eight groups of famous people.

Methods

Birthday and deathday for the following groups were recorded: British prime ministers, US presidents, Academy Award best actor, best female actor, best director, Nobel Prize winners, Wimbledon men's and ladies' singles winners, all from when records began. For each group, the difference in days between the deathday and birthday was calculated. Under the hypothesis of no association, one can expect the difference to have a uniform distribution. This is assessed using goodness-of-fit tests on a circle.

Results

All groups showed some departure from the uniform and it occurred around the birthday in all groups. British prime ministers, US presidents, Academy Award actors and directors, Nobel Prize winners and Wimbledon men show a 'dip' in deaths around the birthday. The length of the 'dip' varied between the groups and so they gave different p-values on different test statistics. For Academy Award female actors and Wimbledon ladies, there was rise in deaths before and after birthday. When Nobel Prize winners were subdivided into their categories, Science and Literature had a 'dip' around the birthday, but not other categories.

Conclusions

We conclude 'something' happens to deathday around the birthday. Some groups of famous people show a 'dip' in death rate around the birthday while for others, particularly women, the association is in the opposite direction.

### A mixed methods study of the impact of consultant overnight working in an english emergency department [^c8459284]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative methods

Data sources

We analysed routinely collected data January 2013 to June 2017 on the number of arrivals, time to be seen and time to departure, of all adults attending the ED. Overnight was defined as between 22:00 and 06:00 the following day.

Adverse event reports (AER) are completed voluntarily by staff and are classified from near miss to severe impact and we used this a surrogate measure of safety. Using the AER database all reports classified as severe or moderate generated on the nights where consultants consistently worked overnight (Monday to Thursday) were compared with when they were on call (Friday to Sunday) for the period June 2016 to July 2017.

Study variables

We hypothesised that the introduction of a consultant overnight would give an abrupt and permanent shift in the total time in the department experienced by a patient who arrived during 22:00–06:00 period. Over the 24-hour day, we explored the minutes to be first seen by a doctor following triage and the hourly occupancy change: the average difference between the number of hourly arrivals to the department and the number departing. Lastly, we used the frequency of AERs as a surrogate measure of safety.

Statistical analysis

We conducted a retrospective analysis of total time in department using a controlled interrupted time series (ITS) design to account for biases in the level and trend at baseline. We used segmented regressionwith adjustments for seasonality as well as autocorrelation in the residuals. Full modelling details and a detailed explanation of ITS are available in the online supplementary appendix. The data were divided into two segments of monthly intervals representing before and after the introduction of consultant night-time presence: (1) January 2013 to October 2015 (n = 34) and (2) November 2015 to June 2017 (n = 20). Each data point represents the average total time in department for a month. We used 06:00–22:00 hours performance as a quasicontrol group to adjust for intrahospital effects that might influence ED such as improved 'patient flow' allowing more timely emergency admissions.

We interviewed senior clinicians to identify any interventions that took place close to November 2015. Friday to Sunday were excluded as a control group, due to an increase in middle grade staffing during 2016. There were no simultaneous ED interventions on a Monday to Thursday reported.

### Contribution to the understanding of how principal component analysis-derived dietary patterns emerge from habitual data on food consumption [^6cc1ace5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study sample

For this study, dietary data were obtained from a validation and calibration substudy within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam cohort (initial recruitment date for EPIC-Potsdam: August 1994). The validation substudy was conducted between 2010 and 2012; recruitment started in August 2010. Details of the validation substudy are available elsewhere. In brief, participants aged 35–64 y at baseline from the EPIC-Potsdam cohort who were still actively participating in follow-up interviews were eligible for recruitment to the substudy. A total of 1447 invitations were sent out, drawn from a random age- and sex-stratified sample of the eligible study participants. Of these, 816 men and women finally provided data for this substudy. Ethical approval of the study was attained from the Ethics Committee of the Medical Association of the State of Brandenburg. All participants gave written informed consent.

Dietary assessment

Every participant provided three 24hDRs (mean ± SD = 2.99 ± 0.14) using EPIC-Soft within a period of 4–24 mo (mean ± SD = 7 ± 1.27 mo). The first recall took place in person during the participants' first visit to the study center. The other two 24hDRs were obtained on random days including weekends over the telephone. All 24hDRs were performed by trained interviewers. Food consumption was recorded in 11 eating occasions throughout every day (see Supplemental Table 1) and was recorded for each food in grams per eating occasion. A total of 2431 such 24hDRs were collected.

Foods were collapsed into 39 food groups, shown in the text following, as has been done previously (see Supplemental Table 2) and averaged over the days and meals to derive the habitual and meal intakes, respectively. For studying the food intake on the meal level, we selected 4 main eating occasions (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner), based on the participant-identified labels and peaks in contribution to the whole day's food intake (in grams). All eating occasions were included for the analysis of single days and habitual food intake.

### Improving surgical weekend handover [^d3c50856]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 6 refers to the question "How often do patients have clear weekend plans?". 21.4% of respondents in Q1 ranked this as 4 or 5 compared with 28.6% in Q2.

Table 7 refers to the question "How often do you think unnecessary bloods are being done?". In this question a score of 5 equates to "always" and a score of 1 equates to "never". 57.1% of respondents ranked this as 4 or 5 in both Q1 and Q2.

Table 8 refers to the question "How often is it stated which day(s) patients need bloods checking?". 61.5% of respondents ranked this as 4 or 5 in Q1 compared with 100% in Q2.

The average time taken to locate a patient on the old style of lists was 21 seconds, compared to 15 seconds at the end of PDSA cycle 1 and 4 seconds with the final version of the weekend list. The difference in time between the original list and the final version is statistically significant even with the relatively small sample size used. (see Sheet 2 in Tables of results)

The reported average time spent compiling a list of jobs on a day at the weekend fell from 30–40 minutes pre-intervention to 13–15 minutes after PDSA cycle 1, 10–12 minutes at the end of PDSA cycle 2 and less than 5 minutes at the end of PDSA cycle 4 (table 10).

The reported average time spent copying information from the weekday lists to the weekend lists was 15–20 minutes before the introduction of the standardised week team lists (PDSA cycle 3) this fell to less than 5 minutes after their introduction (Table 11).

P355 ICU discharge into weekends and public holidays: an observational study of mortality

N Mawhood, T Campbell, S Hollis-Smith, K Rooney

Bristol Royal Infirmary, General Intensive Care Unit, Bristol, United Kingdom

Introduction:

Up to a third of in-hospital deaths in ICU patients occurs following ward stepdown [1]. Discharge time seems to be associated with in-hospital prognosis, but meta-analyses have not shown a difference in weekday compared to weekend discharge [2,3]. However, papers that examined discharge 'into' out-of-hours days, particularly on Fridays, have found differences [3]. Our aim was to assess whether discharge from ICU 'into' out-of-hours (OOH - weekends and public holidays) is associated with in-hospital mortality or re-admission to ICU, and whether these patients were seen on the wards OOH by medical staff.

Methods:

All adults discharged from the general ICU to a ward at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in December 2016–18 were included. In-hospital mortality rates were assessed for each day, with 'into weekdays' defined as Sunday to Thursday and 'into OOH' Friday, Saturday and the day before a public holiday. A subset of patients with data on readmission rate to ICU was also examined. All available notes from patients discharged into OOH in 2018 were reviewed.

Results:

The study included 1732 patients with a subset of 443 with readmission data. 117 sets of notes were reviewed from patients discharged into OOH (Figure 1). The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients discharged into OOH (5.1% vs 7.6%, P = 0.012). Within the subset, OOH was associated with in-hospital mortality or readmission to ICU (6.8% vs 11.9%, P = 0.044), though readmission rate alone was not (1.7% vs 2%, P = 0.35). Of patients discharged into OOH, once on a ward 64% were reviewed by a specialty doctor but 20.5% were not seen.

If so, what kind of sex are you having?", "Have you ever had sex with a person of your same sex?", "Are you having sex with someone who can get you pregnant?", "Do you use anything to prevent STIs? If yes, what do you use?", "How often do you and your partner(s) use a condom when you have sex?", "Do you ever feel pressured to have sex or has anyone interfered with your birth control?", "Have you ever had sex for money or drugs?", "Have you 'sexted'? Sent or received explicit pictures?", and "When, if ever, do you see yourself having children?".

### "Hardly worth the effort"? Medical journals' policies and their editors' and publishers' views on trial registration and publication bias: quantitative and qualitative study [^82e9bc2f]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Qualitative study

We used the results from the quantitative survey to identify journals with different policies on trial registration. From this list we selected 31 for invitation to ensure that we had sufficient interviewees from journals with different registration policies. We focused especially on journals that had recently changed their policy because we hoped that the discussions leading to such changes would be fresh in the editors' minds. We also attempted to select a sample that was representative of characteristics such as publication volume/frequency, type of publisher (commercial or academic society), status of editor (full time or part time), place of publication, and specialty. Of the 31 journals invited by email, 15 were willing and available to be interviewed during the required period (September 2012). (We purposely invited more potential interview participants than we thought would be needed, to ensure that we had a large enough sample available during the study timeframe.) In one case, both editor and publisher took part in the interview (giving a total of 16 interviewees from 15 journals). For other journals, the interviewee was the editor in chief (n = 11), an associate editor (n = 1), or the publisher (n = 2). Ten of the interviewees were based in Europe and six in North America.

Data were gathered by in-depth, semistructured interviews, mainly by telephone, with two conducted face to face and one via Skype video link. An experienced qualitative researcher (PW) conducted all interviews. The interview schedule contained six open questions (see supplementary file), which was sent to interviewees before the interview, along with background information about the project. Participants were asked whether their contribution could be recorded and transcribed and were assured anonymity. Every interviewee agreed to these terms, although in two cases there were technical problems with the recording equipment, so the researcher took notes. The notes were sent to the interviewees to check and supplement if required. Interviews lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes.

Both investigators reviewed and "framework" analysed the transcripts and notes. This approach involves a systematic process of filtering and sorting material into themes and key issues. Once we had established the key themes, including topics defined a priori from the research aims and issues raised by the interviewees, we thematically indexed and "charted" the transcripts and notes thus allowing comments related to each theme to be grouped and sorted. From this we elicited further concepts and associations and assessed the strength and extent of views and reported behaviour.

### GP participation in increasing uptake in a national bowel cancer screening programme: the PEARL project [^4557461d]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Method

The PEARL intervention took place in Wessex between September 2014 and October 2015 and was designed to run for a fixed period of time. The flowchart in Figure 1 summarises the PEARL process. On the first Wednesday of each month, BCSP subject-level data (subject name, address, number of test kits sent, number of test kits returned, date of initial invitation, date standard 28-day reminder letter sent) for each participating practice were downloaded from the ORACLE-based BCSP database (Bowel Cancer Screening System). The full name, NHS number, and address of all non-responders whose kit had been sent out 60–90 days prior to the extract date were entered onto a spreadsheet for each practice and sent using secure mail. The broad 60–90-day range is due to the programme download being run on a single day each month, and using a 30-day moving window to ensure no subjects were missed. The practice reviewed each subject's history and indicated on the spreadsheet using a drop-down menu whether the subject should be sent an additional reminder.

GPs returned completed spreadsheets to the Hub by secure e-mail.

Ten working days after the initial list was sent, the list of subjects on returned GP spreadsheets was checked against a new download of subject-level data from Bowel Cancer Screening System to ensure that subjects remained non-respondent, were still registered with the same GP, and that there was no record of death. GP-endorsed reminder letters were printed for all eligible subjects with the appropriate GP letterhead and signature. This process was repeated 15 working days after the initial list for any GP spreadsheets returned late.

In any 1 month, if no non-responders were identified for a participating practice, the practice was notified by e-mail that they would not receive a list that month. Practices that did not return a completed spreadsheet were sent a reminder e-mail 5 working days after the spreadsheet was sent.

### Getting a valid survey response from 662 plastic surgeons in the 21st century [^9d79aab6]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Web-based surveys save time and money. As electronic questionnaires have increased in popularity, telephone and mailed surveys have declined. With any survey, a response rate of 75% or greater is critical for the validity of any study. We wanted to determine which survey method achieved the highest response among academic plastic surgeons.

Methods

All American Association of Plastic Surgeons members were surveyed regarding authorship issues. They were randomly assigned to receive the questionnaire through 1 of 4 methods: (A) emailed with a link to an online survey; (B) regular mail; (C) regular mail + $1 bill, and (D) regular mail + $5 bill. Two weeks after the initial mailing, the number of responses was collected, and nonresponders were contacted to remind them to participate. The study was closed after 10 weeks. Survey costs were calculated based on the actual cost of sending the initial survey, including stationary, printing, postage (groups B-D), labor, and cost of any financial incentives. Cost of reminders to nonresponders was calculated at $5 per reminder, giving a total survey cost.

Results

Of 662 surveys sent, 54 were returned because of incorrect address/email, retirement, or death. Four hundred seventeen of the remaining 608 surveys were returned and analyzed. The response rate was lowest in the online group and highest in those mailed with a monetary incentive.

Conclusions

Despite the convenience and low initial cost of web-based surveys, this generated the lowest response. We obtained statistically significant response rates (79% and 84%) only by using postal mail with monetary incentives and reminders. The inclusion of a $1 bill represented the greatest value and cost-effective survey method, based on cost per response.

### Tips for a physician in getting the right job, part XIII: applicant questions about remuneration, call, and time off [^2520f2cb]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Part of how an applicant is judged is by the quality of questions he/she asks. If the answers to the questions could be readily found with minimal research, that does not give a good impression. Failure to ask good questions can be viewed as a lack of knowledge, preparation, or interest. If the candidate asks many questions about finances and vacations during the opening minutes of an interview, without inquiring about the practice, that also does not give a good impression. On the other hand, during the later phases of an interview day(s), questions regarding remuneration, call, and time off should be asked.

### Increased double product on monday morning during work [^d2df68b9]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

It has been reported that cardiovascular events often occur on Monday morning, especially in the young working population. Because hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk, we examined whether blood pressure was elevated on Monday, especially in the morning during work. However, there were no weekly rhythms in blood pressure itself. Instead, we found significant interactions between the double product (systolic blood pressure × heart rate) and weekly (high on Monday) and circadian (high in the morning) rhythms. Further studies are required to determine whether Monday morning preference in cardiovascular events is caused by increased double product.

### The weekend effect: now you see it, now you don't [^a58bd4ff]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Those who yearn for a world in which policies are based on a systematic and dispassionate assessment of the evidence can find little encouragement in the ongoing debate about the safety of hospitals at weekends. Almost nothing is clear in this tangled tale. It began when the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, claimed on the BBC Today programme that there were 6000 avoidable deaths each year and a lack of weekend cover by consultants was a key factor. Yet the evidence to support this claim was elusive. Sometimes the Department of Health pointed to a 2012 paper on hospital mortality. Other times, and contrary to the government's code of practice on use of statistics, they mentioned a (then) yet to be published paper in The BMJ. The problem was that, while both did identify an increase in deaths among those admitted at weekends, neither attributed it to a shortage of medical staff. Both identified numerous possible explanations, including various data artefacts. Indeed, the second paper stated explicitly that "to assume that [these deaths] are avoidable would be rash and misleading".

### Weekly, seasonal, and festive period weight gain among Australian adults [^738ac634]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Weekly Weight Fluctuation

Across all participants and weeks of the year, detrended weight fluctuated by 0.3% each week (ie, for the mean [SD] weight of 84.0 [20.0] kg per participant, weight varied by 252 g each week). Results of the mixed-effects linear regression modeling for daily variation in weight (reference, Monday) are given in Table 2. Weights for all days of the week except Tuesday were significantly lower than weights on Monday. Thus, participants' weight peaked on Mondays and Tuesdays (mean [SE] weight change, 0.01% [0.03%]; 95% CI, −0.05% to 0.06%; P = 0.83 for Tuesday) with weight gradually decreasing across subsequent weekdays (mean [SE] weight change, −0.08% [0.03%]; 95% CI, −0.13% to −0.03%; P = 0.003 for Wednesday; −0.15% [0.03%]; 95% CI, −0.21% to −0.10%; P < .001 for Thursday; and −0.18% [0.03%]; 95% CI, −0.24% to −0.13%; P < .001 for Friday) and increasing on the weekend (mean [SE] weight change, −0.16% [0.03]; 95% CI, −0.21% to −0.10%; P < .001 for Saturday and −0.10% [0.03%]; 95% CI, −0.15% to −0.05%; P < .001 for Sunday). When weekly weight fluctuation was considered separately based on annual weight change category, the amplitudes of weekly weight fluctuations were similar for the stable weight and weight gain groups, and relatively smaller for the weight loss group (eTable in Supplement 1).

### Will things feel better in the morning? A time-of-day analysis of mental health and wellbeing from nearly 1 million observations [^8f1a975d]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Moderation by day, season and year

We then tested whether the association of time with each outcome differed across day of the week, astronomical season and survey year. Only the interactions between time and day of the week were statistically significant and so were included in the final model (online supplemental table S4). Figure 3 shows the predicted patterns over time separately by day of the week for each outcome, setting other covariates at their reference values.

Figure 3
Predicted changes over time from linear mixed-effects model with moderation by day of the week for each outcome (covariates fixed at reference values): (a) depressive symptoms, (b) anxiety symptoms, (c) happiness, (d) life satisfaction, (e) worthwhile and (f) loneliness. Solid lines representing significantly different patterns to Sunday (p < 0.05). std, standardised.

For depressive and anxiety symptoms, Tuesday and Wednesday showed different patterns of change compared with Sunday. On these 2 days, depressive and anxiety symptoms were higher in the morning, and decreased slightly throughout the day, before starting to increase into the night. However, on other days, depressive and anxiety symptoms were at the lowest level in the morning, fluctuated throughout the day, and then peaked at midnight. The difference between early morning and midnight could be as high as 10% of the SD for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Relative to other days, there were fewer changes across time on Tuesday and Wednesday.

There were substantial differences between early morning and midnight in well-being measures, which were as high as 15% of the SD. For happiness and life satisfaction, the weekdays showed fewer variations across time compared with weekends. During weekends, both happiness and life satisfaction were at their highest in the morning, decreased sharply until midday, increased steadily into the evening, and then started to decrease again, with the lowest point at midnight. Worthwhile ratings showed similar patterns on weekends. But, in contrast to other well-being outcomes, worthwhile ratings on Wednesday to Friday followed similar patterns to the weekend. Only Monday and Tuesday were significantly different to Sunday, showing less variation across time.

Loneliness was relatively stable across time, and there were no differences in time-of-day patterns across different days of the week.

### Weekday and survival after cardiac surgery – A Swedish nationwide cohort study in 106 473 patients [^9e8e62b4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Study Population and Patient Characteristics

Patient characteristics according to weekday category are presented in Table 1. The number of patients operated on each day of the week is shown in Figure 1. A total of 106 473 patients with a mean age of 67 years were included. Of these, 27% were women. The majority (87%) of patients underwent surgery during Monday to Thursday. Patients were categorized according to weekday of surgery: 25 221 (24%), 24 471 (23%), 22 977 (22%), 20 189 (19%), 9251 (8.7%), and 4364 (4.1%) underwent surgery during a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and a Saturday/Sunday, respectively. Patient characteristics were similar across groups with the exception that in relative terms, semi‐urgent (waiting time 10 days or less) and emergent surgery were more common during Friday–Sunday (Figure 1).

### My personal experiences at the BEST medical center: a day in the clinic-the morning [^60546db2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dr. Ida Lystic is a gastroenterologist who trained at the OTHER (Owen T. Henry and Eugene Rutherford) Medical Center, after having completed her MD degree at the prestigious Harvey Medical School (recently renamed the Harvey Provider School). She accepted a faculty position at the BEST (Byron Edwards and Samuel Thompson) Medical Center. Dr. Lystic shares her experiences on a typical morning in gastroenterology clinic. Although her clinic start date was delayed by 2 months after becoming sick following a mandatory flu shot and having to complete more than 70 hours of compliance training modules, she is now familiar with the BEST system. Clinic scheduling priorities include ensuring that the staff can eat lunch together and depart at 5:00 pm. It is a continual challenge to find time to complete the electronic medical record after BEST changed from the SIMPLE (Succinct Input Making Patients Lives Electronic) system to LEGEND (referred to as Lengthy and Excessively Graded Evaluation and Nomenclature for Diagnosis by her colleagues). To maintain clinic punctuality, a compliance spreadsheet is e-mailed monthly to the Wait Time Committee. Their most recent corrective action plan for tardy physicians included placing egg timers on the doors and having nurses interrupt visits that exceed the allotted time. Administrative decisions have resulted in downsizing personnel. Patients are required to schedule their own tests and procedures and follow-up appointments-causing low patient satisfaction scores; however, the money saved lead to a large year-end bonus for the vice president of BEST Efficiency, who holds "providers" accountable for the poor patient experience. Although Dr. Ida Lystic and the gastroenterology clinic at "the BEST Medical Center" are creations of the authors' imagination, the majority of the anecdotes are based on actual events.

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^51fb0050]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimum days and optimal combination estimation

In order to extract the best (and worst) collection day combinations for each nutrient or food group, we used another approach wherein we compare the ICC of different day combinations to the mean intake of the entire dataset (consisting of a 7 day week). Hence, under the assumption of an entire week being sufficient in capturing the nutritional variation, this method allows to elucidate which days of the week (or their combinations) lead to highest (or lowest) ICC values when comparing to the full week.

Figure 4 highlights the best and worst day combinations at different number of days across various nutritional features (for the full set of nutrition features, see Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). Since the assumption of one week being sufficient to capture variation already loses some precision, we set the ICC threshold in the assessment below at 0.9, indicating excellent reliability. In order to achieve this threshold, carbohydrate intake required 3 days that were spread across the week (Monday, Wednesday and Saturday) for the best combination. The worst combination of 3 days also reached the 0.9 threshold, but the days were continuous weekdays from Monday to Wednesday. Similarly, for protein and fat intake, it required 3 days minimum for the best combination to cross the 0.9 threshold and included two weekdays and one weekend day (Saturday for both protein and fat), while their worst 3 day combination was below the 0.9 threshold. For fiber, the best combination of 2 days (Monday and Wednesday) attained the 0.9 threshold precisely, although with 3 days, even the worst combination was above the excellent reliability threshold. For alcohol, the alternating day combination at 3 days resulted in being the best combination which surpassed the threshold, while the worst combination at even 4 days - which were all continuous weekdays - was below the threshold. Eaten quantity and water intake required only one day of collection (Wednesday) to reach the reliability threshold. The same can be observed for non-alcoholic beverages group (Supplementary Fig. 6) Coffee intake nearly achieved this threshold with just one day of data (Tuesday). Interestingly, when adopting a more conservative approach by increasing the collection period to 2 days, the optimal combination for all four nutritional features (eaten quantity, water, non-alcoholic beverages and coffee) was consistently Monday and Friday. Similarly, extending to a 3 day collection period, the best combination was Monday, Tuesday, and Friday for all these features (except for non-alcoholic beverages).

### Texting is caring: a content analysis of clinical text messages by hospitalists [^b1d436df]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Results

A total of 129 360 threads were sent during the study period. Of these, we analysed 809 (0.6%) threads. We determined saturation had been reached based on consensus from team members that additional message threads no longer yielded new insights or themes. The average thread length was five messages. Our analytical sample included a total of 614 unique users, 66 of whom were hospitalists. On average, the hospitalists were in the age group of 35–44 years old and had spent 13 years in clinical practice. Table 1 describes their demographic characteristics. The hospitalists' demographic data were drawn from two internal departmental sources and presented in aggregate as percentages without individual Ns, as the number of hospitalists included in each source was slightly different. As we were blinded to the identities and demographics of message senders, table 1 serves to provide context on the clinicians in our sample rather than to provide within-group comparison.

Table 1
Hospitalist demographics

Table 2 summarises the message threads by process and purpose with illustrative examples. Among the 809 threads in which the hospitalists participated, clinical management was the most common process discussed in the threads (62%; n = 498). The next most common category was 'don't know' (25%; n = 206). Many of these 'don't know' threads were single-message threads with little detail and no follow-up response; they were often simple requests for the recipient to call back. In these situations, the message process was often indiscernible. About 14% (n = 115) of threads discussed administrative matters, and 12% (n = 97) pertained to patient discharges.

### Email for clinical communication between patients / caregivers and healthcare professionals [^94726a10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Email is a popular and commonly-used method of communication, but its use in health care is not routine. Where email communication has been demonstrated in health care this has included its use for communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals for clinical purposes, but the effects of using email in this way is not known. This review addresses the use of email for two-way clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals.

Objectives

To assess the effects of healthcare professionals and patients using email to communicate with each other, on patient outcomes, health service performance, service efficiency and acceptability.

Search Methods

We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to January 2010), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1967 to January 2010), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to February 2010) and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). We searched grey literature: theses/dissertation repositories, trials registers and Google Scholar (searched July 2010). We used additional search methods: examining reference lists, contacting authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies examining interventions using email to allow patients to communicate clinical concerns to a healthcare professional and receive a reply, and taking the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For continuous measures, we report effect sizes as mean differences (MD). For dichotomous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as odds ratios and rate ratios. Where it was not possible to calculate an effect estimate we report mean values for both intervention and control groups and the total number of participants in each group. Where data are available only as median values it is presented as such. It was not possible to carry out any meta-analysis of the data.

Main Results

We included nine trials enrolling 1733 patients; all trials were judged to be at risk of bias. Seven were randomised controlled trials; two were cluster-randomised controlled designs. Eight examined email as compared to standard methods of communication. One compared email with telephone for the delivery of counselling. When email was compared to standard methods, for the majority of patient/caregiver outcomes it was not possible to adequately assess whether email had any effect. For health service use outcomes it was not possible to adequately assess whether email has any effect on resource use, but some results indicated that an email intervention leads to an increased number of emails and telephone calls being received by healthcare professionals. Three studies reported some type of adverse event but it was not clear if the adverse event had any impact on the health of the patient or the quality of health care. When email counselling was compared to telephone counselling only patient outcomes were measured, and for the majority of measures there was no difference between groups. Where there were differences these showed that telephone counselling leads to greater change in lifestyle modification factors than email counselling. There was one outcome relating to harm, which showed no difference between the email and the telephone counselling groups. There were no primary outcomes relating to healthcare professionals for either comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence base was found to be limited with variable results and missing data, and therefore it was not possible to adequately assess the effect of email for clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals. Recommendations for clinical practice could not be made. Future research should ideally address the issue of missing data and methodological concerns by adhering to published reporting standards. The rapidly changing nature of technology should be taken into account when designing and conducting future studies and barriers to trial development and implementation should also be tackled. Potential outcomes of interest for future research include cost-effectiveness and health service resource use.

### Inter-physician communication in pediatric orthopaedics: what do pediatricians want to hear from us? [^18f53057]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric orthopaedic surgeons often communicate with general pediatric providers to facilitate patient care, but little data exist on communication preferences. This study investigates pediatric provider preferences regarding when they would like to receive patient updates from pediatric orthopedists, which communication modalities they prefer, and what information they like to receive.

Methods

We developed a 19-question e-mail survey to evaluate provider preferences on communication modality, timing, frequency, and what data they deem important as it relates to musculoskeletal patient care.

Results

A total of 111 general pediatric providers in our geographical region completed the survey. Among the providers, 55.9% preferred fax, 40.5% electronic health record inbox message, 19.8% e-mail, 12.6% mail, and 7.2% call/voicemail. The majority (67.9%) preferred information in a traditional note format, whereas 24.8% preferred a summary in paragraph format. Patient diagnosis and treatment plan for shared patients were the most important pieces of information for general pediatric providers to receive from pediatric orthopedists. Of various patient-specific scenarios included in the survey, referrals for osteomyelitis concern, fractures requiring surgery, scoliosis concern, and developmental dysplasia of the hip requiring treatment were considered most important for pediatric orthopedists to send updates. In terms of frequency of communication, over half of the pediatric providers (59.5%) desired updates after the first visit and after care plan changes (50.5%).

Conclusion

Only 43.5% of pediatric providers feel like current communication with pediatric orthopaedic surgeons is "always" or "often" adequate. Most of our surveyed providers preferred occasional SOAP notes through fax as communication from pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. The communication deemed most important to providers related to referrals where the provider makes the initial diagnosis and then refers the patient to orthopaedics for a condition with potential long-term patient impacts. Finally, providers felt communication was most important after the first pediatric orthopaedic office visit.

Analyses exploring the association between discharge characteristics and 30-day mortality showed substantially higher risk of mortality for discharge on a Sunday, although this was relatively rare (N = 4653 (2.5%) of discharges). Out-of-hours discharge was also associated with elevated mortality. These findings were not attenuated after adjusting for discharge destination (Table 5).

### Patient-physician e-mail: an opportunity to transform pediatric health care delivery [^3ccbb6c3]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to assess the patterns of patients who use a patient-physician e-mail service, measure physician time required to answer a patient question via e-mail compared with that via telephone, and determine the satisfaction of families who are provided e-mail access to their child's rheumatologist.

Methods

A consecutive series of patients' families were offered e-mail access during a 2-year period. Data regarding patient e-mail use were collected, including urgency of message, subject matter, message volume, and time of day of messaging. The duration of the pediatric rheumatologist's e-mail interactions and telephone interactions with patients was measured using a stopwatch. After 1 year of enrollment in the patient-physician e-mail service, families were mailed a 12-item satisfaction survey regarding their e-mail experience.

Results

A total of 306 of 328 families who were offered patient-physician e-mail access enrolled, and 121 used the service. The patients sent 40% of their e-mails outside business hours. Messages that were urgent (notification of disease flare, notification of new symptoms, or parent expectation of same-day response) made up 5.7% of the e-mails sent to the physician. Messages that required emergent attention made up 0.002% of the e-mails to the physician. Answering patient questions by e-mail was 57% faster than using the telephone for the physician. The physician received 1.2 e-mails per day from patients. The families who responded to the survey agreed that patient-physician e-mail increased access to the physician and improved the quality of care. The families did not find that patient-physician e-mail distanced them from their child's doctor.

Conclusions

Patient-physician e-mail is a service that patients will use given the opportunity. The e-mail service enables physicians to answer medical questions with less time spent compared with telephone messaging. In our experience in an academic pediatric subspecialty practice, patients reported enhanced communication and access with the e-mail service.

### What we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic: time to think outside the box, maybe far outside [^8201f065]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a profound effect on our lives and careers; this presentation explores some of the lessons we have learned from it and others that it may yet teach us. Socioeconomic effects have been profound, not all of them favorable. Travel and meeting activities, as well as many other activities, have been severely restricted. Social unrest has become intense, and it may have questionable political consequences, as the United States is undergoing a contested election result.

### Choosing the best apple: counselling leaflets and technologies of communication in the history of reproduction [^2740ac9c]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Later career of Our Child Shall Be Healthy

The first edition of the Our Child Shall Be Healthy met with a positive response and the demand increased. 18 In this regard, some board members suggested to refinance the production, now calculated with 10 000 copies, with advertisements, a decision that was renewed in the following year, after the first edition proved 'highly successful', as Wendt reported to the advisory board. 19 With 300 requests per day, delivery was behind schedule and he hired an assistant. 20 By 1977, the first edition (100 000 copies) was sold out. To meet the orders, Wendt organised a reprint (2000 copies). 21 In 1978, the first edition reached 120 000 copies. Two-thirds had been requested by prospective clients; one-third was disseminated over pharmacies, as an inlay in the popular and free-of-charge Journal of Pharmacies. 22 Wendt successfully applied for additional funding with the Ministry of Education and, together with paediatrician Kurt Hartung, produced a revised version of the counselling leaflet. 23

Revisions cannot be traced in the archives in full detail. However, from 1978, they were a key topic at the FDC meetings, now held at Wendt's Department for Human Genetics at Marburg's Robert-Koch-Straße 7, a historical building in the university district. Also, minutes of these meetings included exchange with major West German institutions in medical self-administration (ie, the General Practitioners Association, the Federal Doctor's Chamber, the Bavarian Doctor's Chamber, the Federal Union of German Public Insurance, the Union of private Insurance, and the Associations of Gynaecologists and of Paediatricians). In turn, with this stronger support network, the leaflet circulated among broader audiences in screenings and preventive check-ups in general practices 24; patients received it from specialists they trusted, in gynaecological and paediatric practices 25; women encountered it at maternity and infant welfare services; and pupils and teachers encountered it in schools. 26 Remarkably, in the district of Hesse, it was handed over to couples by the marriage registrar 'to emphasise its meaning' and was displayed at the registry's office. 27 Moreover, it contributed to the content of popular TV shows, as Campaign Sorrow Child (ZDF) and Campaign Prevention adopted its content. 28 In other words, the paper technology of the counselling leaflet gave counselling encounters a specific form in a variety of contexts.

### The activity on a Norwegian occupational health mailing list 1997–2006 [^14bc18cb]. Occupational Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Professional mailing lists on the Internet have become a popular medium for communication in the medical field. There are few descriptions of the scientific activity on these mailing lists and none concerning occupational health have been found.

Aim

To describe the activity of an occupational health electronic mailing list in Norway between 1997 and 2006.

Methods

All messages sent to the Norwegian Occupational Health mailing list from 1997 to 2006 were studied, counting numbers, members and type of topic discussed. The job titles of contributors in 2006 were identified and all messages in a 3-month period in 2006 were analysed in more detail.

Results

A total of 5269 messages were posted to the list. The number of members was 200 at the start of 1997, later rising to between 450 and 500, including doctors, physiotherapists, occupational hygienists and nurses. The main topics discussed were chemical hazards (19%), organization of occupational health services (17%), working methods in health and safety in general (10%) and ergonomics (8%). Most messages were questions and answers and they seldom led to discussion.

Conclusions

The activity shows the need for electronic mailing communication in occupational health services. A broad range of topics was covered and most professional disciplines in occupational health services were represented. The quality of the content and usefulness of the discussions need further investigation.

### Weekday and survival after cardiac surgery – A Swedish nationwide cohort study in 106 473 patients [^dc7f1dd8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between weekday of surgery and survival following cardiac surgery.

Methods and Results

In a nationwide cohort study, we included all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in 1999–2013 from the(Swedish Web‐system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register. All‐cause mortality until March 2014 was obtained from national registers. The association between weekday of surgery and mortality was estimated using Cox regression, and reported as hazard ratios with 95%. We used the restricted mean survival time difference to estimate loss of life related to weekday of surgery. Among 106 473 patients, 25 221 (24%), 24 471 (23%), 22 977 (22%), 20 189 (19%), 9251 (8.7%), and 4364 (4.1%) underwent surgery during a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and a Saturday/Sunday, respectively. More patients were operated on urgently during Friday to Sunday, and unadjusted analyses showed higher early and late mortality in those patients. The adjusted hazard ratios (95%) were 1.00 (0.89–1.13), 1.00 (0.88–1.12), 1.02 (0.90–1.16), 1.17 (1.01–1.37), and 1.05 (0.86–1.29) in patients who underwent surgery during a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday/Sunday compared to a Monday, after 1 year of follow‐up conditional on 30‐day survival. In elective surgery (n = 46 146), the 1‐year restricted mean survival time difference (95%) was −0.5 (−1.8–0.8), −0.5 (−1.9–0.8), −1.0 (−2.6–0.5), 0.02 (−2.2–2.3), and −1.2 (−6.3–3.9) days in patients who underwent surgery during a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and a Saturday/Sunday, respectively, compared to a Monday.

Conclusions

We found no evidence of a clinically relevant weekday effect in patents who underwent cardiac surgery in Sweden during a 15‐year period. These data suggest that the early risk and long‐term prognosis following cardiac surgery was not affected by the weekday of surgery.
