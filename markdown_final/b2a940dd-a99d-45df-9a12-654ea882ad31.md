## Question

What insulin sliding-scale protocol is used to manage hypercalcemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what insulin sliding-scale protocol is used to manage hypercalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether insulin has any established role in lowering serum calcium. Then, I should verify guideline-backed acute management strategies for hypercalcemia and their dosing. Next, I will differentiate this from hyperkalemia, where insulin/glucose is standard of care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, severity-based plan and confirm monitoring and special-case considerations like vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia or parathyroid carcinoma, ensuring I am not missing any niche roles for insulin in calcium disorders.

> Wait, let me verify the premise about insulin first. Sliding-scale insulin is a glycemic management approach and, to my knowledge, is not a therapy for hypercalcemia; I should confirm if any guideline or label endorses insulin for lowering calcium. I need to check authoritative guidance: hyperkalemia protocols clearly endorse IV insulin with dextrose for intracellular potassium shift, but I find no analogous protocol for serum calcium reduction, and major hypercalcemia guidelines do not list insulin among therapies, which suggests this query conflates two emergencies. In fact, recognized hyperkalemia algorithms recommend 10 units of regular insulin with 25 g glucose IV, whereas hypercalcemia pathways do not include insulin at all, reinforcing that insulin is not used to treat elevated calcium and that a "sliding scale" does not apply here [^115bePMV] [^114bM9tf] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the physiologic rationale. Insulin activates Na+/K+-ATPase and shifts potassium intracellularly, rapidly lowering serum potassium, but there is no comparable, clinically meaningful mechanism by which insulin would lower serum calcium. Established hypercalcemia treatments either increase renal calcium excretion through volume expansion and diuresis or suppress osteoclastic bone resorption with antiresorptives, which is entirely different biology from insulin's effects on potassium homeostasis. The absence of insulin from hypercalcemia guidelines aligns with this physiology, and case literature of hypercalcemia in metabolic crises underscores that correction hinges on fluids and antiresorptives rather than insulin per se [^11436HwS] [^1165qPtd] [^112YhgNW].

> Next, I should review first-line acute management. I need to ensure I'm precise about hydration targets and cautions. The immediate cornerstone is aggressive isotonic saline to correct volume depletion and enhance calciuresis, typically starting around 200–300 mL/h and then titrating to maintain adequate urine output, with close attention to cardiac and renal status to avoid fluid overload; guidelines emphasize individualized rates and monitoring while awaiting the effect of definitive antiresorptives. Let me double-check that the guidance consistently lists hydration as first-line and warns about overhydration in heart failure, which it does across sources and labels [^1165qPtd] [^1162YY3B] [^116DARnd].

> I will now examine rapid-onset bridging therapy. Calcitonin can provide a prompt but transient reduction in calcium within hours, which is helpful while antiresorptives take effect; I should confirm dosing and tachyphylaxis. The FDA labels recommend starting at 4 U/kg SC/IM every 12 hours, with escalation to 8 U/kg every 12 hours or every 6 hours if needed, and limiting duration due to tachyphylaxis that typically emerges within 48 hours. Wait, I should verify both label sources align on indications and dose ranges; they do, including its role as early treatment in hypercalcemic emergencies [^113QYyzs] [^113CUFbv] [^112WBYfC].

> Let me consider definitive antiresorptive therapy and renal considerations. Current guidelines recommend an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab as foundational treatment; for severe hypercalcemia, combining calcitonin plus an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab upfront is suggested. I should confirm pamidronate dosing by severity and infusion duration to minimize renal toxicity, and ensure renal function is assessed before IV bisphosphonates and that renal-adjusted infusions are used when CrCl < 60 mL/min. For refractory cases on bisphosphonates, denosumab is recommended, and this is consistent across the Endocrine Society statements and drug labels. Wait a minute, pamidronate dosing for severe hypercalcemia should be 90 mg IV over 2–24 hours; yes, that matches the label, and the guidance also endorses denosumab when bisphosphonates fail or are contraindicated [^114bM9tf] [^111f3qBb] [^111h89Hk] [^115jPgSs] [^115D7nUZ] [^114YJv7v].

> But wait, what if the etiology is vitamin D–mediated or parathyroid carcinoma. I should confirm adjunctive options tailored to cause. Glucocorticoids can be effective in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia by reducing calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption, which I should keep in mind when granulomatous disease or ectopic calcitriol excess is suspected. For parathyroid carcinoma or refractory PTH-mediated hypercalcemia, calcimimetics such as cinacalcet are recommended, with antiresorptives as co-therapy when needed; guidelines explicitly advise considering a calcimimetic when IV bisphosphonate or denosumab alone is insufficient. Let me verify those cause-specific recommendations align across sources, and they do [^11436HwS] [^117QEbk6] [^111PoG78] [^115axwpM] [^112L1pMf] [^1161Kmkz].

> I should also review rescue options and monitoring. In life-threatening hypercalcemia with renal failure or fluid-limited states, hemodialysis with a low- or calcium-free bath or CRRT may be necessary as temporizing therapy; I need to note that while effective, response rates are variable and evidence is largely from case series and reports. During and after antiresorptive therapy, I must ensure close monitoring of magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamin D to mitigate hypocalcemia risk, with repletion when low and periodic reassessment after denosumab, given its potential for profound hypocalcemia, particularly in CKD or malabsorption. Let me double-check that routine monitoring of these electrolytes and vitamin D is explicitly recommended; it is [^1158y4CC] [^114qvJCj] [^113nCtSD] [^1142ghTs] [^115ZQPwk].

> Let me reconsider the original request to ensure I'm not overlooking any niche indication for insulin. There is no insulin sliding-scale protocol for hypercalcemia; the term "sliding scale insulin" belongs to diabetes glycemic management, and insulin with dextrose is specific to hyperkalemia management for intracellular K+ shifting. If the concern is hyperkalemia, then the standard regimen is 10 units of regular insulin with 25 g dextrose IV, adjusted per severity, but this should not be used with the intent to lower calcium. The correct approach to hypercalcemia is aggressive isotonic saline, rapid-onset calcitonin as needed, and definitive antiresorptive therapy with an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab, tailored by renal function and etiology, with electrolyte and vitamin D monitoring and dialysis when indicated. I should double-check those anchor recommendations one more time, and they are consistent across high-quality guidelines [^115onKP5] [^115bePMV] [^1165qPtd] [^111f3qBb].

Insulin sliding scales are **not used for hypercalcemia**; they are for glycemic control in diabetes. Insulin is not a standard therapy for hypercalcemia and is not included in current guidelines [^1165qPtd] [^1154nhGm]. Hypercalcemia is managed with **IV hydration, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin, and loop diuretics** [^111f3qBb]; insulin is only used if the patient also has hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. If insulin is given for hyperglycemia, monitor calcium and glucose closely to avoid hypoglycemia and electrolyte shifts [^112wDscR] [^115onKP5].

---

## Clinical indications for insulin therapy

Insulin therapy is primarily indicated to manage hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus [^116Y9X3C]. Sliding-scale insulin regimens adjust doses based on blood glucose, particularly in hospitalized patients with fluctuating levels [^113owGj5]. However, insulin therapy is **not indicated** for managing hypercalcemia [^1165qPtd].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between insulin and calcium metabolism

Insulin primarily regulates glucose metabolism but also has indirect effects on calcium. It can promote intracellular calcium uptake, which may briefly lower serum calcium, but the effect is **not clinically significant** enough to warrant insulin therapy as a primary treatment for hypercalcemia.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for hypercalcemia management

Current guidelines from the Endocrine Society and other authoritative sources **do not recommend insulin therapy**, including sliding-scale regimens, for hypercalcemia [^1165qPtd] [^1154nhGm]. Instead, recommended treatments include:

- **Intravenous hydration**: Adequate hydration with IV fluids is the first-line therapy for hypercalcemia, particularly in hypercalcemia of malignancy [^1165qPtd].

- **Bisphosphonates**: Intravenous bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid, pamidronate) are recommended for lowering serum calcium levels in hypercalcemia of malignancy [^114bM9tf].

- **Denosumab**: Denosumab is recommended for refractory hypercalcemia or when bisphosphonates are contraindicated [^114YJv7v].

- **Calcitonin**: Calcitonin is recommended for rapid, short-term reduction of serum calcium levels [^113QYyzs].

- **Loop diuretics**: Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may be used after adequate hydration to promote renal calcium excretion [^11436HwS].

Insulin therapy is **not mentioned** in these guidelines as a treatment for hypercalcemia [^1165qPtd] [^114bM9tf].

---

## Risks and complications of insulin therapy in hypercalcemia

Administering insulin to hypercalcemic patients carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Hypoglycemia**: Insulin administration can cause hypoglycemia, particularly in patients without diabetes or those with normal glucose levels [^116Y9X3C].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Insulin can cause shifts in electrolytes, potentially exacerbating existing electrolyte disturbances in hypercalcemic patients [^115onKP5].

- **Increased patient morbidity**: Unnecessary insulin administration can increase patient morbidity and complicate clinical management.

---

## Clinical scenarios where insulin therapy may be considered

Insulin therapy may be considered in hypercalcemic patients **only if they also have hyperglycemia** or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In such cases, insulin is indicated to manage hyperglycemia or DKA, not to treat hypercalcemia itself [^112wDscR].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy in hypercalcemia

If insulin therapy is used in hypercalcemic patients with concurrent hyperglycemia, **careful monitoring** and adjustment are necessary [^113owGj5]:

- **Frequent blood glucose monitoring**: Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hypoglycemia [^116Y9X3C].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Serum calcium and other electrolytes should be closely monitored to detect and manage any imbalances [^115onKP5].

- **Individualized insulin dosing**: Insulin doses should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, including renal function, nutritional status, and concurrent medications [^113owGj5].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments for hypercalcemia

Several **pharmacological alternatives** are recommended for hypercalcemia [^1154nhGm]:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Bisphosphonates | Inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption | Hypercalcemia of malignancy |
| Denosumab | - Inhibits RANKL <br/> - Reducing bone resorption | Refractory hypercalcemia |
| Calcitonin | - Inhibits osteoclast activity <br/> - Increases renal calcium excretion | Rapid, short-term calcium reduction |
| Loop diuretics | Increase renal calcium excretion | Adjunctive therapy after hydration |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Sliding-scale insulin regimens are **not recommended** for hypercalcemia [^1165qPtd]. Insulin is indicated for managing hyperglycemia and has no established role in treating hypercalcemia [^112wDscR]. Current guidelines recommend intravenous hydration, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin, and loop diuretics for hypercalcemia [^111f3qBb]. Insulin should be considered only when hypercalcemia coexists with hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Prolia [^115ZQPwk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prolia can cause severe hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Prolia. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Severe hypocalcemia and mineral metabolism changes**: In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to 14 days after Prolia injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

- **Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease**: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (i.e. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m), including dialysis-dependent patients, are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following Prolia administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events, and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^112WBYfC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within four hours of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be given at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 hours; the duration of dosing is, however, limited to 48 hours due to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy is rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. Additionally, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease of high serum calcium levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcaemia or organ damage, but, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT. A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcaemic patients as in those with hypercalcaemia; however, bone density was higher in the normocalcaemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcaemic or hypercalcaemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcaemic patients. Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and to those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and the development of organ damage should be offered.

### Hypercalcemia: A review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L), or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes include granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies like thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements like calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of cases.

Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause.

### Onco-nephrology: The pathophysiology and treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^11436HwS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia complicates the course of 10%-30% of all patients with malignancies and can be a sign of very poor prognosis and advanced malignancy. Prompt recognition of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and institution of therapy can be lifesaving, affording the opportunity to address the underlying etiology.

The mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia generally fall into three categories: humoral hypercalcemia due to secreted factors (such as parathyroid-related hormone), local osteolysis due to tumor invasion of bone, and absorptive hypercalcemia due to excess vitamin D produced by malignancies.

- **Mainstays of therapy**: Aggressive intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, and perhaps loop diuretics.
- **Adjunctive therapy may include**: Calcitonin and corticosteroids.
- **Alternatives for refractory cases**: Gallium nitrate and perhaps denosumab.

In patients presenting with severe acute kidney injury (AKI), hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath can be effective. In most cases, therapy normalizes calcium levels and allows for palliation or curative therapy of the malignancy.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^115tWxh6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia. It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer.

On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents. Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### Pamidronate disodium [^116DARnd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP, in conjunction with adequate hydration, is indicated for the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases. Patients who have either epidermoid or non-epidermoid tumors respond to treatment with Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly, and an attempt should be made to restore urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures, such as saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics. Patients must be adequately hydrated throughout treatment, but overhydration, especially in those with cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia. The safety and efficacy of Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with hyperparathyroidism or other non-tumor-related conditions has not been established.

Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP is also indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone. The effectiveness of Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP was demonstrated primarily in patients with serum alkaline phosphatase levels three times the upper limit of normal. Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP therapy is effective in reducing serum alkaline phosphatase.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115axwpM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of parathyroid carcinoma, specifically in relation to hypercalcemia management, the ES 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an IV bisphosphonate or denosumab. This is particularly advised for adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma that is not adequately controlled with a calcimimetic.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^115bePMV]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

The UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend the administration of insulin/glucose for the management of hyperkalemia, particularly concerning intracellular shifting. Specifically, they advise using 10 units of soluble insulin in 25 g of glucose by IV infusion for treating severe hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of ≥ 6.5 mmol/L.

### Renal impairment as a surgical indication in primary hyperparathyroidism: Do the data support this recommendation [^114pw7nN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved over the past two decades, yet impaired renal function has consistently been a surgical indication. This recommendation has been based on the historical association between primary hyperparathyroidism and renal impairment. A review of the literature is needed to determine whether this recommendation is warranted.

- **Evidence acquisition and synthesis**: PubMed was utilized to identify English-language articles published between January 1990 and February 2014 using keywords related to hyperparathyroidism and renal function. The keywords were "primary hyperparathyroidism", "surgery", "parathyroidectomy", "kidney", "renal", "glomerular filtration rate", and "creatinine". Of the 1926 articles obtained with this search, all articles relevant to the topic that quantified the relationship between primary hyperparathyroidism and renal function were included. All references within these articles were investigated for inclusion. When helpful, data tables were constructed to summarize the results succinctly.

- **Conclusions**: A secondary elevation of PTH levels has not been consistently shown to occur at the threshold currently indicated for surgical intervention. While renal impairment is seen with more significant disease, mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism has not been conclusively associated with renal impairment. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that surgically curing primary hyperparathyroidism via a parathyroidectomy has any impact on renal function.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: Finding the balance [^1162YY3B]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy primarily involves addressing the underlying cancer to reduce tumour production of factors that promote bone resorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption. However, this approach may not be feasible or effective in patients with advanced cancer. Therefore, therapies that inhibit bone resorption and promote renal calcium excretion become crucial.

Most patients presenting with hypercalcaemia of malignancy are dehydrated, making rehydration an essential first step in treatment. Saline should be administered at an initial rate of 200–300 mL/h and then adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h. It is important to note that rehydration addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying disease, and therefore, it rarely resolves hypercalcaemia on its own.

Nearly all patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy experience increased osteoclastic bone resorption, making the inhibition of bone resorption a key target for managing this condition.

### Severe hypercalcemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^112YhgNW]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The patient presented with significant hyperglycemia, requiring up to 0.2 units/kg/h of intravenous insulin. Severe metabolic acidosis persisted for four days. This was attributed to a combination of severe dehydration, combined ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis, and hyperchloremia (maximum chloride levels, 145 mmol/L). Other electrolyte imbalances included hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and hypermagnesemia. Creatinine kinase was moderately raised (maximum 1,497 IU/L) with myoglobinemia, suggesting rhabdomyolysis, and the patient developed moderate renal failure (maximum creatinine, 269 mmol/L). Urine output in the first 24 hours in the PICU was 0.4 mL/kg/h.

Fluid was increased by 10%, but further rises in sodium levels and worsening renal function were noted. Dehydration was identified as the key factor driving the hypercalcemia, with dehydration at presentation reestimated at 10%. Fluid management was adjusted to 4% dextrose with 0.18% saline, recalculated at maintenance plus 7.5% correction over 48 hours. A furosemide infusion was commenced to maintain a urine output of 3–4 mL/kg/h. Adjunct intravenous hydrocortisone was added, and renal ultrasonography on day two excluded nephrocalcinosis. Although bisphosphonate therapy was considered, it was deemed inappropriate due to the associated risks given the renal function.

The patient's blood glucose levels stabilized by day three (< 10 mmol/L), and hypercalcemia, renal function, and hypernatremia normalized within a week. Nine days after the initial presentation, serum calcium concentration was 2.46 mmol/L. The patient made a full recovery with no neurologic deficit.

### High-dose insulin therapy: Is it time for U-500 insulin [^111jEMPz]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To provide an overview of U-500 regular insulin action, this review examines published clinical studies and offers guidance to practicing endocrinologists for identifying patients for whom U-500 regular insulin may be appropriate.

This review was produced through a synthesis of relevant published literature compiled via a MEDLINE search of English-language literature published between January 1969 and July 2008. The topics included U-500, insulin resistance, concentrated insulin, high-dose insulin, insulin pharmacokinetics, and diabetes management, along with the authors' collective clinical experience.

The obesity epidemic is contributing to an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, as well as to increasing insulin requirements in insulin-treated patients. Many patients exhibit severe insulin resistance, with daily insulin requirements of 200 units or greater or more than 2 units/kg. Delivering an appropriate insulin volume to these patients can be difficult and inconvenient, and it may be best accomplished with U-500 regular insulin via multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, rather than standard U-100 insulin. Implementation of U-500 regular insulin in patients previously on other insulin formulations is described with a treatment algorithm covering dosage requirements ranging from 150 to more than 600 units per day based on the authors' experience.

Regimen conversion of appropriately selected patients from high-dose U-100 insulin to U-500 insulin is presented within the context of these findings.

Measurement of the size of the parathyroid glands is mandatory for the selection of optimal therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Surgical parathyroidectomy or parathyroid intervention is indicated for patients with nodular hyperplasia, as this form is seldom responsive to medical therapy. Selection of the intervention should be determined by the number, size, and location of the parathyroid glands with nodular hyperplasia, including ectopic glands.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

A key question remains as to whether normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) should be considered a distinct entity from hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (hPHPT), or if they can be managed using a single approach. Studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently from hPHPT, such as a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease. Furthermore, a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardized approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium levels appears appropriate, and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualized, and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counseling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction, and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

- **Limitations of the literature**: Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to address these limitations to provide a more robust understanding of the role of surgery in managing nPHPT.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition known as hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria, anuria, somnolence, and coma.

Once a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program must be followed to either prove or exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In cases confirmed as primary hyperparathyroidism, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid a fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours, and during this time, serum calcium should be lowered. The treatment of choice is hemodialysis against a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### Sensipar [^111KFxga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring for hypocalcemia**: Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis, and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

	- For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Cinacalcet to prevent parathyrotoxic crises in hypercalcaemic patients awaiting parathyroidectomy [^112wvLUB]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder. Hypercalcaemia exceeding 3 mmol/l is a major risk factor for parathyrotoxic crises, and management of patients at risk remains a medical challenge. The authors recently managed three such patients referred for severe nephrolithiasis. All had severe hypercalcaemia (at least 3 mmol/l). Instead of the usual management, which involves hospitalization in an intensive care environment (for about 5–7 days) for rehydration and infusion of intravenous bisphosphonates, followed by emergency parathyroidectomy, the three patients received ambulatory cinacalcet (not an approved indication), 30 mg twice a day. The serum calcium normalized in two cases and declined to a safe level in the third case, allowing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to be performed at a date chosen according to the patients' and surgeon's respective schedules. The authors consider that cinacalcet may benefit severely hypercalcaemic patients awaiting surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Multiple endocrinopathies, hypercalcaemia and pancreatitis following combined immune checkpoint inhibitor use - case report and review of literature [^114EHWXg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a novel class of oncological agents used to treat a number of malignancies. At the time of writing, seven agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both solid and hematological malignancies. Despite their efficacy, they have been associated with a number of endocrinopathies. We report a unique case of hypophysitis, thyroiditis, severe hypercalcaemia, and pancreatitis following combined ICI therapy.

- **Case presentation**: A 46-year-old Caucasian female with a background of malignant melanoma and lung metastases presented to the emergency department with lethargy, nausea, palpitations, and tremors. She had been started on a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 24 weeks earlier. Initial investigations revealed thyrotoxicosis with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of < 0.01 (0.38–5.33) mIU/L and free T4 of 66.9 (7–16) pmol/L. TSH receptor and thyroperoxidase antibodies were negative. She was diagnosed with thyroiditis and treated with a beta-blocker. Six weeks later, she presented with polyuria and polydipsia. A corrected calcium of 3.54 (2.2–2.5) mmol/L and parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 9 (10–65) pg/ml confirmed a diagnosis of non-PTH mediated hypercalcaemia. PTH-related peptide and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels were within the normal range. Cross-sectional imaging and a bone scan ruled out bone metastases but revealed an incidental finding of acute pancreatitis; both glucose and amylase levels were normal. The patient was treated with intravenous hydration and zoledronic acid.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112NeCjY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Conservative treatment to decrease calcium levels in pregnant women with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is primarily based on oral and/or intravenous rehydration and avoidance of excessive nutritional calcium intake. However, if this approach does not successfully control hypercalcemia and surgery is not an option, the initiation of cinacalcet may be considered for women with severe hypercalcemia. For instance, in women with an albumin-adjusted serum calcium level above 3.0 mmol/L, cinacalcet might be seriously considered if the benefits outweigh the risks, as advocated by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The FDA classifies cinacalcet as a category C drug, indicating that it has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an observed increase in the frequency of malformation or other harmful effects on the fetus. Animal studies have shown that cinacalcet crosses the placenta, but no embryonal or fetal toxicities were observed, except for decreased fetal body weights at doses associated with maternal toxicities. The literature includes only a few case reports and case series about pregnant women on cinacalcet, and outcomes were generally favorable.

If cinacalcet is initiated, it is important to consider that the calcium-sensing receptor is located in the placenta. Therefore, cinacalcet may potentially alter placental function and inhibit transplacental calcium transport, which could suppress fetal parathyroid hormone secretion.

### Endocrine and metabolic manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease [^112dSBBR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The main treatment aim is the prevention of fractures. All patients should receive lifestyle advice on the prevention of falls, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake and smoking cessation, and regular weight-bearing exercise. An attempt should be made to control the underlying disease and maintain remission. If necessary, calcium and vitamin D supplements should be prescribed to ensure a daily calcium intake of 1000 mg in younger patients and 1200 to 1500 mg in postmenopausal women and men over 55, and a daily vitamin D intake of 400 to 800 IU. Larger amounts of vitamin and calcium may be necessary in Crohn's disease patients with extensive small bowel disease.

Hypogonadal patients should receive hormone replacement. Premenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and amenorrhea are usually treated with combined estrogen-progestin replacement, either through an oral contraceptive pill or transdermal estradiol plus oral progestin administered cyclically. Because glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause hypogonadism by suppressing gonadotrophins, men who are on long-term GC treatment should have periodic assessments of their morning serum testosterone (and gonadotrophins) and be put on testosterone replacement should they become hypogonadal.

Glucocorticoid use should be minimized when possible by using alternative therapies such as the appropriate and early use of immunomodulators, budesonide, elemental or polymeric diet, or surgery for resistant disease. All IBD patients receiving glucocorticoids should be given calcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonate prophylaxis should be used for those over 65 years at the commencement of glucocorticoid treatment.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^116tzkNS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, especially parathyroidectomy, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, including those who are asymptomatic, when no contraindications exist and one or more of the following conditions are present:

- **Serum calcium**: ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the ULN

- **Skeletal involvement**: Such as a fracture identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site

- **Renal involvement**: Such as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or evidence of increased stone risk, like urinary calcium excretion > 400 mg/day (corrected for creatinine clearance; ≥ 250 mg/day in women; > 300 mg/day in men)

- **Age consideration**: < 50 years (no other indications are necessary; age < 50 years is a sufficient indication)

### Expert opinion on current trends in the use of insulin in the management of people with type 2 diabetes from the south-eastern European region and Israel [^112wDscR]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

The experts identified absolute indications for insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes (T2D) to ensure appropriate diabetes management. These include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pregnancy with uncontrolled glycaemia despite lifestyle intervention, and extreme glycaemia.

- **Metabolic emergencies**: Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), which is more prevalent in people with T2D, and DKA are two cases of significant decompensation. These emergencies may require management in the intensive care unit. In critically ill and mentally obnubilated individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, followed by a transition to subcutaneous (SC) insulin regimens.

- **Acute medical/surgical conditions**: In cases where individuals not previously treated with insulin require it during the postoperative period, a SC regimen of 0.5–0.7 U/kg of body weight can be used. Insulin is also the first-line therapy for individuals hospitalised for acute illness with significant hyperglycaemia or those on steroid therapy.

- **Pregnancy**: While metformin is commonly prescribed, insulin remains the preferred option for treating hyperglycaemia in gestational diabetes mellitus or pre-gestational T2D, as it does not cross the placenta and is effective in controlling glycaemic levels if a sufficient dosage is administered.

Considering these medical conditions, all experts agreed that, in routine clinical practice, glycaemic levels are the most prominent reasons for the initiation and intensification of insulin treatment.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^116nMrq9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Impact on quality of life

Patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) commonly report a deterioration in their quality of life. Therefore, it is important to consider whether parathyroidectomy can improve the quality of life of these patients. A prospective multicentre study by Bannani et al. compared quality of life improvements following parathyroidectomy in nPHPT patients and patients with hypercalcaemic mild primary hyperparathyroidism (hmPHPT). Following parathyroidectomy, the physical component summary score from the SF-36 questionnaire showed significant improvement in both nPHPT (p = 0.040) and hmPHPT (p = 0.016) patients. However, the mental component summary score failed to improve significantly in nPHPT patients, improving only in hmPHPT patients (p = 0.043).

The effect of parathyroidectomy on 25 non-specific symptoms was also investigated in this study. At 3 months post-surgery, three non-specific symptoms (thirst, mood swings, and anxiety) were found to have improved in nPHPT patients. However, extended follow-up at 1 year post-surgery, which likely indicates long-term benefits, revealed significant improvements in only two symptoms (thirst and fatigue). This improvement in non-specific symptoms was less pronounced in nPHPT patients compared to the hmPHPT group, which showed significant improvement in nine non-specific symptoms 1 year post-surgery.

### Surgery for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the third international workshop [^1119hk9G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

An international workshop on primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was convened on May 13, 2008, to review and update the previous summary statement on the management of asymptomatic PHPT published in 2002.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Electronic literature sources were systematically reviewed, addressing critical aspects of the surgical issues pertaining to the indications, imaging, surgical treatment, and cost-effective management of patients with PHPT.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The surgical group concluded that many patients with "asymptomatic" PHPT have neurocognitive symptoms that may be unmasked after successful parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, reduced bone density and increased fracture risk can be improved with parathyroidectomy. When PHPT is symptomatic, it may be associated with nephrolithiasis, increased cardiovascular disease, and decreased survival. Preoperative imaging studies should only be performed to help plan the operation, and negative imaging should never preclude surgical referral. Noninvasive localization studies, including ultrasound and sestamibi scans, are often employed, especially in anticipation of focused explorations. Invasive localization studies should be reserved for remedial explorations where noninvasive imaging has been unsuccessful.

- **Conclusions**: When performed by expert parathyroid surgeons, parathyroid surgery is safe, cost-effective, and associated with very low perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive approaches to parathyroid surgery appear to be as effective as the classic bilateral cervical exploration approach.

### Yorvipath [^112wq1DD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use only one injection to achieve the once-daily recommended dosage. Using two injections to achieve the recommended once-daily dosage increases the risk of unintended changes in serum calcium levels, including hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia [see dosage and administration (2.4, 2.6) and warnings and precautions (5.1)]. The maximum recommended dosage is 30 mcg subcutaneously once daily. If an adequate response is not achieved with a maximum Yorvipath dosage of 30 mcg, consider adding or restarting calcium and/or active vitamin D therapy and/or seeking other treatment options [see warnings and precautions (5.1)].

Yorvipath's once-daily subcutaneous dosage is individualized. The recommended starting dosage is 18 mcg once daily and is titrated in 3 mcg increments or decrements, with the goal of maintaining serum calcium within the normal range without the need for active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol) or therapeutic calcium doses (elemental calcium > 600 mg/day). Calcium supplementation sufficient to meet daily dietary requirements may be continued. Advise patients to monitor daily for clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia.

Measure serum calcium 7 to 10 days after the first Yorvipath dose and after any dose change in Yorvipath, active vitamin D, or calcium supplements, and monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Once the Yorvipath maintenance dosage is achieved, measure serum calcium levels at a minimum every 4 to 6 weeks or as indicated for symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia.

### Calcium acetate [^117SJqvZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting calcium acetate and vitamin D. Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of calcium acetate. Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

- **Hypercalcemia**: Patients with end-stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, such as calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate.

Overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, requiring emergency measures. During the dosage adjustment period early in treatment, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. If hypercalcemia develops, reduce the calcium acetate dosage or discontinue treatment, depending on the severity.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or present as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. It is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcifications. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification.

### Ganite [^113QsNFm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Ganite is indicated for the treatment of clearly symptomatic cancer-related hypercalcemia that has not responded to adequate hydration. In general, patients with a serum calcium level (corrected for albumin) of less than 12 mg/dL would not be expected to be symptomatic. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be managed with conservative measures, such as saline hydration with or without diuretics.

In the treatment of cancer-related hypercalcemia, it is important first to establish adequate hydration, preferably with intravenous saline, to increase renal excretion of calcium and correct dehydration caused by hypercalcemia.

### Successful management of hypercalcemic crisis by continuous renal replacement therapy with regional citrate anticoagulation and surgery: a case report [^114qvJCj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypercalcemia depends on its severity and underlying etiology. Initial management includes hydration, diuresis, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, denosumab, and corticosteroids. In cases of severe hypercalcemia causing a decrease in consciousness, arrhythmia, or progressive acute kidney injury, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with a low-calcium replacement solution may be considered, especially when fluid restriction is mandatory or when there is a poor response to prior treatment. However, the failure rate of CRRT in the treatment of hypercalcemia remains high. A retrospective study that included 42 cases of hypercalcemia treated with CRRT showed that 19 out of 42 cases (45.2%) failed to respond to treatments, which included medications, surgery, and CRRT with a low-calcium replacement solution (1.25 mmol/L). The mortality rate in the nonresponsive group to all treatment modalities was 58.8%, whereas the mortality rate in the CRRT-responsive group was 10.5%. Currently, there is no international consensus regarding the use of CRRT in the treatment of hypercalcemia. Most of the evidence is limited to case reports demonstrating the effectiveness of CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). Therefore, further research is required to investigate the role of CRRT with RCA in refractory hypercalcemia.

In this case, the patient showed typical symptoms of hypercalcemia, such as nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and lethargy, along with a total calcium level of 4.92 mmol/L. Despite following recommended strategies such as fluid resuscitation, diuresis, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin, the total calcium level remained consistently above 3.5 mmol/L.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^117QEbk6]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Calcitriol plays a key role in calcium homeostasis. Systemically, calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors in the kidneys, parathyroid glands, intestines, and bones to raise serum blood calcium levels by facilitating intestinal absorption, renal tubular reabsorption, and bone release. The calcium-binding protein encoded by the transcription factor calcitriol carries both calcium and phosphate ions concurrently through intestinal epithelial cells. By stimulating osteoclasts via the release of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) from osteoblasts, calcitriol promotes bone resorption. By causing apoptosis, calcitriol dramatically reduces the growth of T lymphocytes and normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Through this distinct array of self-regulatory mechanisms, calcitriol increases serum calcium levels.

Therefore, elevated calcitriol levels idiopathically will lead to hypercalcemia that is resistant to feedback pathways that usually reduce parathyroid hormone production and decrease calcium levels. Corticosteroids inhibit the production of calcitriol in macrophages, which reduces gut absorption of calcium, RANKL expression, and theoretically promotes bone retention, reducing calcium levels overall. However, in reality, long-term use of glucocorticoids can result in a variety of side effects, including bone weakening. Glucocorticoids can activate osteoclasts first and later inhibit osteoblasts, which can cause osteoporosis, fractures, and osteonecrosis. Long-term medium or high-dose glucocorticoid use can cause cushingoid facial features and buffalo hump.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111yQyJ6]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical problem, and the only definitive management is surgery. Surgical management has evolved considerably over the last several decades.

The objective of the guidelines is to develop evidence-based protocols to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective practice of parathyroidectomy. A multidisciplinary panel used PubMed to review the medical literature from January 1, 1985, to July 1, 2015. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and recommendations were discussed until consensus.

Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, as it is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates, and preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes.

The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery (minimally invasive parathyroidectomy) and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates. For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring via a reliable approach is crucial.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: New issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common, and in these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring, because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard.

- **Unanswered questions**: Whether the lower bone density in milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy, and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Sensipar [^115yKtfs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In 26-week studies of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, 66% of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 25% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL, whereas, 29% of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis, in which patients were treated for up to 64 months (mean duration of treatment was 21 months in the cinacalcet group), 75% of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 29% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL, and 33% of cinacalcet patients compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most cases of severe hypocalcemia less than 7.5 mg/dL (21/33 = 64%) occurred during the first 6 months. In this trial, 1.1% of patients receiving Sensipar and 0.1% of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: A clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategies. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014. The search was performed using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia", focusing on articles pertaining to diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies.

Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Management of RANKL-mediated disorders with denosumab in children and adolescents: A global expert guidance document [^115gSvEb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Prevention and management of "rebound" hypercalcemia: The primary safety concern in children and adolescents before skeletal maturity is the prevention and early detection of hypercalcemia between denosumab doses or after discontinuation. Skeletally mature adolescents appear to be at lower risk but still require close monitoring. The aim of therapeutic strategies to prevent rebound hypercalcemia is to allow gradual resorption of excess bone accumulated during treatment while preventing rapid resorption that exceeds renal calcium excretion capacity, leading to hypercalcemia. Hydration is an important determinant of renal calcium excretion, and prescribing a daily oral fluid target to ensure fluid intake meets or exceeds recommendations for age and body size, with adjustments for high temperatures and physical exercise, is beneficial.

- **IV bisphosphonates**: These are invariably needed to prevent rebound hypercalcemia after denosumab discontinuation or during tapering of the dose or interval. The premise is to use the longer duration of action and less potent antiresorptive effect of bisphosphonates to decrease the rapid rebound of bone turnover that occurs at denosumab offset. A number of approaches have been used, and there are currently insufficient data to recommend one over the others:
	- Zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg 4 and 8 weeks after the last denosumab dose, followed by risedronate 35 mg weekly (or every 2 weeks if weight < 30 kg) for 6 months. If hypercalcemia occurs, an additional dose of zoledronate 0.025 mg/kg is given. Alendronate may be used instead of risedronate.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1154nhGm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is the most common metabolic complication of malignancies, but its incidence may be declining due to potent chemotherapeutic agents. The high mortality associated with HCM has declined markedly due to the introduction of increasingly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. Despite the widespread availability of efficacious medications to treat HCM, evidence-based recommendations to manage this debilitating condition are lacking.

The objective of this guideline is to develop treatment guidelines for adults with HCM. A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, together with experts in systematic literature review, identified and prioritized eight clinical questions related to the treatment of HCM in adult patients. The systematic reviews (SRs) queried electronic databases for studies relevant to the selected questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. An independent SR was conducted in parallel to assess patients' and physicians' values and preferences, costs, resources needed, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and other domains relevant to the Evidence-to-Decision framework, as well as to enable judgments and recommendations.

The panel recommends (strong recommendation) treatment with denosumab (Dmab) or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) in adults with HCM. The following recommendations were based on low certainty of the evidence. The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) in adults with HCM…

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: a structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during the assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcemia must be considered through the calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history should be taken to evaluate dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and supplemented if necessary. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were measured. This brief review describes the assessment of a patient with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Calcitonin salmon [^113CUFbv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Calcitonin salmon synthetic injection is a calcitonin indicated for the following conditions:

- **Treatment of Paget's disease of bone**: Calcitonin salmon injection is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of bone in patients with moderate to severe disease characterized by polyostotic involvement with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline excretion. There is no evidence that the prophylactic use of calcitonin salmon is beneficial in asymptomatic patients. Calcitonin salmon injection should be used only in patients who do not respond to alternative treatments or for whom such treatments are not suitable (e.g. patients for whom other therapies are contraindicated or for patients who are intolerant or unwilling to use other therapies).

- **Treatment of hypercalcemia**: Calcitonin salmon injection is indicated for the early treatment of hypercalcemic emergencies, along with other appropriate agents, when a rapid decrease in serum calcium is required, until more specific treatment of the underlying disease can be accomplished.

- **Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis**: When alternative treatments are not suitable, calcitonin salmon may be used for postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, fracture reduction efficacy has not been demonstrated.

- **Limitations of use**: Due to the possible association between malignancy and calcitonin salmon use, the need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a periodic basis.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112VXGxe]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Effect of pharmacological treatment: Parathyroid carcinoma patients' morbidity and mortality arise primarily from hypercalcemia. Patients with severe hypercalcemia and/or hypercalcemic crisis need to be medically stabilized before any surgical operation. In addition, nonoperative tumors or widely metastatic disease bring out the need for medical management of chronic hypercalcemia and the related symptoms. Except for hydration and loop diuretics, multiple agents with transient efficacy regarding hypercalcemia, and no efficacy regarding tumor burden, have been used: potent bisphosphonates such as pamidronate and zoledronate, calcitonin, octreotide, and corticosteroids may achieve only temporary control of hypercalcemia, whereas other agents such as mithramycin, plicamycin, and gallium nitrate are abandoned because of renal toxicity. Denosumab has shown sustained efficacy in controlling hypercalcemia in a parathyroid carcinoma patient with severe hypercalcemia and resistance or contraindication in other available agents.

- **Cinacalcet**: Encouraging data concerning the efficacy of calcimimetic therapy with cinacalcet derive from a multicenter, open-label, single-arm dose-titration study that included 29 inoperable parathyroid carcinoma patients. The cinacalcet dose progressively increased up to a tolerated maximum of 360 mg daily, divided into four equal doses. A marked and sustained decrease in serum calcium was observed (from 12.7 ± 0.8 mg/dL to 9.9 ± 0.9 mg/dL), although neither PTH levels nor ALP showed significant alteration.

### Denosumab for management of parathyroid carcinoma-mediated hypercalcemia [^114dZs92]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Most of the morbidity and mortality from parathyroid cancer is due to PTH-mediated hypercalcemia. Classically, management mainly consists of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and alleviation of hypercalcemia using bisphosphonates and calcium receptor agonists. The use of denosumab in the treatment of parathyroid cancer-mediated hypercalcemia has not been reported.

The aim of this report is to describe the effect of denosumab on parathyroid cancer-induced hypercalcemia. The patient is a 39-year-old man with metastatic parathyroid cancer who presented at age 35. His calcium levels initially responded to surgery, bisphosphonates, calcium receptor agonist, and chemotherapy (dacarbazine). However, his disease progressed, and his hypercalcemia became refractory to these measures in the setting of rising PTH levels. The addition of denosumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, resulted in successful management of his hypercalcemia for an additional 16 months.

Denosumab can be effective in the treatment of refractory hypercalcemia in parathyroid cancer. It may also be of potential use in settings of benign hyperparathyroid-related hypercalcemia such as parathyromatosis, where hypercalcemia is not amenable to surgery or medical therapy with bisphosphonates and calcium receptor agonists.

### Endocrine and metabolic emergencies: Hypercalcaemia [^116SKEqF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Hypercalcaemia is commonly seen in the context of parathyroid dysfunction and malignancy and, when severe, can precipitate life-threatening sequelae. The differential diagnosis of hypercalcaemia is broad and can be categorized based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The acute management of severe hypercalcaemia is discussed along with a brief review of therapeutic advances in the field.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, a subset of people is identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that manifests as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not meet the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, presenting a challenge in diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT to better characterize this patient population and determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms often experience improvement after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group with biochemically mild pHPT who progress to classic pHPT over time; however, predicting which patients this will be remains challenging. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Insulin therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [^116Y9X3C]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Here, we review insulin management options and strategies in nonpregnant adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Most patients with T1DM should follow a regimen of multiple daily injections of basal/bolus insulin. However, those not meeting individual glycemic targets or those with frequent or severe hypoglycemia, or pronounced dawn phenomenon should consider continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The latter treatment modality could also be an alternative based on patient preferences and availability of reimbursement.

Continuous glucose monitoring may improve glycemic control irrespective of the treatment regimen. A glycemic target of glycated hemoglobin < 7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for most nonpregnant adults. Basal insulin analogues with a reduced peak profile and an extended duration of action with lower intraindividual variability relative to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin are preferred. The clinical advantages of basal analogues compared with older basal insulins include reduced injection burden, better efficacy, lower risk of hypoglycemic episodes (especially nocturnal), and reduced weight gain.

For prandial glycemic control, any rapid-acting prandial analogue (aspart, glulisine, lispro) is preferred over regular human insulin. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a relatively new option with the advantage of better postprandial glucose coverage. Frequent blood glucose measurements, along with patient education on insulin dosing based on carbohydrate counting, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated physical activity, is paramount, as is education on the management of insulin therapy.

### Pamidronate disodium [^111h89Hk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Consideration should be given to the severity of, as well as the symptoms of, hypercalcemia. Vigorous saline hydration alone may be sufficient for treating mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia. Overhydration should be avoided in patients with potential for cardiac failure. In hypercalcemia associated with hematologic malignancies, the use of glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful.

- **Moderate hypercalcemia**: The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in moderate hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* of approximately 12–13.5 mg/dL) is 60 to 90 mg given as a single-dose, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e. > 2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, especially in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

- **Severe hypercalcemia**: The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium for Injection USP in severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* > 13.5 mg/dL) is 90 mg given as a single-dose, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e. > 2 hours) may also reduce the risk for renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

*Albumin-corrected serum calcium (CCa, mg/dL) = serum calcium, mg/dL + 0.8 (4.0-serum albumin, g/dL).

- **Retreatment**: A limited number of patients have received more than one treatment with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia. Retreatment with pamidronate disodium for Injection USP, in patients who show complete or partial response initially, may be carried out.

### Subclinical and asymptomatic parathyroid disease: Implications of emerging data [^1167SxAw]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by a tendency towards hypercalcemia due to autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone, is common, especially in postmenopausal women. Although parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic patients, most individuals with the disorder are asymptomatic and do not exhibit classic complications, such as renal stones and osteoporosis, at diagnosis. Consensus guidelines suggest which individuals might be suitable for medical follow-up rather than parathyroidectomy; however, there are no long-term randomized controlled trials to support the safety of medical surveillance, and some patients progress over time.

Data from observational studies suggest that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, potentially predicted by parathyroid hormone concentrations, even in asymptomatic individuals. Whether parathyroidectomy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is unproven, but data suggest that surgery decreases fracture risk and might improve neuropsychological symptoms. Studies also indicate that patients with normocalcemic (subclinical) hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism have a low risk of progressing to overt disease, yet their long-term risks remain undefined.

In this review, we explore the increasing range of asymptomatic parathyroid disorders, focusing on evidence about their natural history and potential complications, with a particular emphasis on primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism: The efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid [^115m17sh]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Severe hypercalcaemia in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism is referred to as a hyperparathyroid crisis. Its incidence ranges from 1.6% to 6%. Presentations of a hyperparathyroid crisis are heterogeneous, including neurological alterations, dehydration, hypovolaemia, anorexia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, impaired cardiac and renal functions, and ultimately death if the condition is left untreated. Therefore, a parathyroid crisis should be managed urgently. Parathyroidectomy is currently the only curative treatment option. However, preoperative medical antihypercalcaemic therapy is warranted as a holding measure. This therapy consists of intravenous saline hydration, a loop diuretic, intravenous administration of bisphosphonates, and calcimimetics. Data evaluating the efficacy of these treatments are very limited.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid in the management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Eadsg guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^113owGj5]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Insulin analogues are available in East Africa and may be safely prescribed where appropriate, considering the cost and benefits gained when compared to cheaper and more readily available human insulin (Grade D, EL V).

Various terminologies relating to the use of insulin have been used. Augmentation therapy refers to the addition of basal insulin to a regimen when there is still some β-cell function present, while replacement therapy refers to the use of a regimen that mimics the normal physiology of insulin secretion and is required when there is β-cell exhaustion. Rescue therapy refers to the use of replacement regimens for several weeks, usually to reverse glucose toxicity.

Insulin regimens are difficult to classify. For future comparisons of insulin regimens in East Africa, we suggest adopting the classification proposed by Neu et al, which is based on three categories: (1) fixed insulin dose regimens, (2) glucose and meal-adjusted regimens, and (3) pump therapy. Insulins that may be used in these regimens include short-acting insulin, basal (long-acting) insulin, and premixed insulin. Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of insulin therapy and guides the regimens. Measuring and recording both fasting and 1- or 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) levels over a 2- to 3-day period is the first step in pattern management. The patient's insulin intake is determined by the pattern of these values, with adjustments made for anticipated need.
