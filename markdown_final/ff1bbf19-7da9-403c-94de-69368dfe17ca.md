## Question

how do you test for phenotypes in asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test for asthma phenotypes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the asthma diagnosis objectively before phenotyping. Then, I should verify that the patient truly has difficult-to-treat or severe asthma and exclude mimics. Next, I will review which clinical features meaningfully inform phenotype. After that, I need to check which biomarkers best classify type 2 versus non–type 2 inflammation and how to interpret them. Then, I will integrate clinical and biomarker data into actionable phenotypes. Finally, I should consider special populations, longitudinal reassessment, and how to translate phenotypes into treatment choices, while double-checking guideline nuances and evidence gaps throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of asthma with objective testing, because phenotyping rests on a valid foundation; I need spirometry demonstrating variable airflow limitation, ideally with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase of at least 12% and 200 mL, and if spirometry is nondiagnostic, I should consider bronchial challenge with methacholine or mannitol, recognizing that FeNO can support eosinophilic inflammation but is not a standalone diagnostic test, and I must remember that starting inhaled corticosteroids can mask diagnostic findings, so objective testing should precede ICS when feasible [^114u1h56] [^112FNAFq] [^115xy178] [^114qc2CP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "severe asthma" until I verify adherence, inhaler technique, and environmental triggers; I should confirm that the patient remains uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS plus a second controller or requires frequent systemic steroids, and I must exclude alternative or overlapping diagnoses such as COPD, bronchiectasis, vocal cord dysfunction, and cardiac disease before labeling the phenotype as severe or therapy-resistant, because misclassification here derails downstream decisions [^113sUMe5] [^116hztnW] [^117WLK96] [^111JDo2K].

> Next, I should review the clinical features that most consistently inform phenotype; age of onset, atopy and allergic sensitization, obesity, smoking and occupational exposures, exacerbation frequency and severity, and comorbid rhinosinusitis or nasal polyps all carry signal for type 2 versus non–type 2 pathways, and I need to check for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease features when appropriate, while remembering that clinical phenotypes alone do not map cleanly to treatment response, so I should avoid overcommitting to a label without biomarker support [^114Rshjo] [^115Tc3fc] [^111W9fMx].

> I will now examine the biomarkers that best classify inflammatory phenotypes; blood eosinophils, FeNO, and sputum eosinophils are the core triad, with total IgE informing allergic status but not directly predicting anti–IL-5 or anti–IL-4/13 response, and I should double-check thresholds: blood eosinophils at or above 150–300 cells/μL and FeNO at or above 20–25 ppb support type 2 inflammation, whereas sputum eosinophils at or above 2–3% indicate eosinophilic airways and steroid responsiveness, and I must repeat biomarkers if the patient is on systemic steroids or at high ICS dose because suppression can artifactually lower values [^114u1h56] [^111W9fMx] [^115RyowP] [^113XmHc2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of FeNO in severe asthma treatment guidance; older ATS/ERS guidance cautioned against using FeNO to titrate therapy in severe asthma, but more recent ATS guidance supports FeNO as a complementary tool to identify eosinophilic inflammation and guide anti-inflammatory decisions, so I should reconcile this by using FeNO alongside other biomarkers and clinical context rather than in isolation, and I should be cautious interpreting values in smokers or those on high-dose ICS [^116MLLGt] [^114smLa9] [^115vV7yu].

> Let me consider sputum eosinophils more carefully; I initially thought sputum eosinophils were universally recommended to guide severe asthma therapy, but wait, I should double-check pediatric guidance, which suggests using clinical criteria alone rather than sputum in children due to feasibility and limited pediatric data, whereas adult guidance supports sputum eosinophils where available to refine phenotype and predict steroid or biologic responsiveness, so I need to align the test with local expertise and patient age [^116D9npr] [^117Ek6yZ] [^1122YHRD].

> I need to ensure I integrate clinical and biomarker data rather than relying on a single marker; for example, a patient with late-onset asthma, obesity, low FeNO, and low blood eosinophils likely has non–type 2 mechanisms, whereas early-onset allergic asthma with high FeNO and eosinophils fits type 2–high, but I should confirm that phenotype can shift with exacerbations, infections, or therapy, so repeating biomarkers at baseline and during changes in control helps avoid misclassification and captures treatable traits that evolve over time [^111W9fMx] [^114u1h56] [^1121wmx2].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or an older adult; in pediatrics, I should prioritize clinical features and noninvasive biomarkers like FeNO and blood eosinophils, recognizing that sputum induction is less practical and that phenotype stability may differ, while in the elderly, overlap with COPD and age-related changes complicate phenotyping, so I should confirm variable airflow limitation carefully and consider imaging or comorbidity screens when the presentation is atypical or refractory [^116D9npr] [^114YqRm1] [^1175uqiF].

> Next, I should review how to translate phenotype into treatment; for type 2–high severe asthma, I should confirm eligibility for biologics using local criteria and consider anti–IL-5 or anti–IL-4/13 agents based on eosinophil count, FeNO, atopy, and comorbid nasal disease, whereas for type 2–low disease, I should optimize ICS/LABA, address triggers and comorbidities, and consider macrolides or other non–type 2 strategies, while remembering that inflammatory phenotype does not consistently predict macrolide response, so expectations must be tempered and reassessed longitudinally [^114u1h56] [^117DtY5v] [^1125T6h1].

> Hold on, I should verify longitudinal strategy; phenotypes are not fixed, so I should repeat biomarkers at key junctures — before initiating or switching biologics, during exacerbations, and after major therapy changes — and I should also monitor outcomes that matter to patients, including exacerbations, lung function, and quality of life, aligning with GINA's emphasis on iterative assessment and treatable traits to sustain control and minimize overtreatment [^114u1h56] [^111mun6e].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall approach remains pragmatic and evidence-aligned; there is no single gold-standard phenotype test, so I should combine objective diagnostic confirmation, careful exclusion of mimics, structured clinical profiling, and judicious biomarker use, recognizing that our current tools best define type 2–high disease and that non–type 2 mechanisms remain an important unmet need requiring ongoing evaluation and individualized management plans [^114Rshjo] [^111W9fMx] [^115qfKmf].

---

Asthma phenotyping relies on a **multimodal approach** that integrates clinical features, biomarkers, and physiologic testing to distinguish type 2–high from non–type 2 inflammation and guide therapy [^111mun6e]. The most practical clinical framework is the **type 2/non–type 2 classification**, supported by blood eosinophils, FeNO, and IgE, with sputum eosinophils and advanced tools (genomics, proteomics, imaging) reserved for specialized centers [^114u1h56] [^117Ek6yZ]. Phenotyping is most impactful in severe or uncontrolled asthma, where it informs biologic selection and improves outcomes [^112teAKi] [^114P4jvL].

---

## Clinical features and patient history

Clinical features and patient history provide the **foundation for initial phenotyping** by identifying atopy, age of onset, comorbidities, and trigger patterns [^117NcBWd].

- **Age of onset**: Early-onset asthma is often allergic and type 2–high; late-onset asthma is more often nonallergic and may be type 2–low [^115qfKmf].
- **Allergic sensitization**: History of atopy, eczema, or allergic rhinitis supports allergic asthma; confirm with skin prick or specific IgE testing [^1161qxtH].
- **Comorbidities**: Obesity, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity suggest distinct phenotypes (e.g. obesity-related asthma, AERD) [^112aZnyg].
- **Exacerbation pattern**: Frequent exacerbations, especially with oral corticosteroid use, indicate severe asthma and guide biomarker testing [^111JDo2K].

---

## Biomarkers for phenotyping

Biomarkers are central to **objective phenotyping**, particularly for type 2 inflammation [^114u1h56].

| **Biomarker** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Blood eosinophils | - Simple, widely available <br/> - ≥ 150–300/μL suggests type 2 inflammation <br/> - Predicts response to anti–IL-5/IL-4/IL-13 therapies [^111W9fMx] | - Variable with steroids <br/> - Repeat if on OCS [^114u1h56] |
| Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) | - Noninvasive <br/> - ≥ 20–25 ppb supports type 2 inflammation <br/> - Predicts ICS responsiveness [^115xy178] | - Influenced by smoking, diet, and infections <br/> - Not specific [^116RW1df] |
| Total serum IgE | Indicates atopy; supports allergic asthma phenotype [^113weJcE] | - Poor predictor of biologic response <br/> - Not specific for type 2 inflammation [^115RyowP] |
| Sputum eosinophils | Gold standard for airway eosinophilia; ≥ 2–3% supports type 2 inflammation [^114u1h56] | - Limited availability <br/> - Requires trained centers [^1122YHRD] |
| Periostin | Potential T2 biomarker; correlates with IL-13 activity [^116RW1df] | Limited validation; not routinely available [^114PbzX8] |

---

Repeat biomarkers — especially eosinophils and FeNO — are recommended in severe asthma, particularly when patients are on **systemic corticosteroids**, to accurately classify inflammation [^114u1h56].

---

## Physiological testing

Physiological testing characterizes **airflow limitation and hyperresponsiveness**, supporting phenotype assignment and severity assessment [^notfound].

- **Spirometry**: Variable airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.7 with bronchodilator response ≥ 12% and 200 mL) supports asthma [^notfound].
- **Bronchial hyperresponsiveness**: Methacholine or mannitol challenge helps when spirometry is normal but suspicion remains [^notfound].
- **Impulse oscillometry**: Detects small-airway dysfunction, useful in severe or non–type 2 phenotypes [^notfound].

---

## Advanced phenotyping methods

Advanced methods are used in research or specialized centers to define **endotypes** and guide precision therapy [^116eXEVE].

- **Genomics and transcriptomics**: Identify molecular endotypes (e.g. U-BIOPRED) and link them to therapeutic responses [^111t7TXk].
- **Proteomics and metabolomics**: Provide insights into novel pathways and biomarkers [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: HRCT assesses remodeling, bronchiectasis, or alternative diagnoses in severe asthma [^notfound].

---

## Clinical phenotypes and their characteristics

Several **clinical phenotypes** are consistently recognized:

| **Phenotype** | **Clinical features** | **Biomarkers** | **Treatment implications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Allergic asthma | - Early onset <br/> - Atopy <br/> - Elevated IgE | - High IgE <br/> - High FeNO <br/> - Eosinophils | - ICS <br/> - Anti-IgE (omalizumab) <br/> - Anti–IL-4/IL-13 (dupilumab) [^111W9fMx] |
| Nonallergic eosinophilic asthma | - Late onset <br/> - Nonatopic <br/> - Severe | - High eosinophils <br/> - High FeNO | - Anti–IL-5 (mepolizumab, benralizumab) <br/> - Anti–IL-4/IL-13 (dupilumab) [^111W9fMx] |
| Obesity-related asthma | - Late onset <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Poor control | - Low FeNO <br/> - Low eosinophils | - Weight loss <br/> - ICS <br/> - Consider macrolides [^114u1h56] |
| Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) | - Nasal polyps <br/> - Aspirin sensitivity | - High eosinophils <br/> - High FeNO | - Avoid NSAIDs <br/> - Desensitization <br/> - Anti–IL-4/IL-13 (dupilumab) [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Heterogeneity**: Phenotypes can shift over time, limiting stability and reproducibility [^1121wmx2].
- **Lack of standardization**: No universal definitions or thresholds exist across studies and guidelines [^1118d2MR].
- **Access and cost**: Advanced biomarkers and imaging are not widely available, especially in primary care [^113XmHc2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**: confirm asthma, assess control and severity, then phenotype severe or uncontrolled disease using biomarkers and clinical features to guide therapy [^114Rshjo]. For severe asthma, obtain blood eosinophils, FeNO, and IgE; consider sputum eosinophils where available; and use results to select biologics and other targeted therapies [^116KAnSA] [^114u1h56].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Emerging trends include a **treatable traits** approach targeting specific inflammatory pathways and comorbidities, and the development of novel biomarkers and machine learning models to improve phenotyping accuracy and stability [^111mun6e] [^1179Ex8n]. Efforts also focus on expanding access to biomarker testing and integrating phenotyping into routine care [^112teAKi].

---

Asthma phenotyping integrates clinical features, biomarkers, and physiology to classify inflammation and guide therapy, with the **type 2/non–type 2 framework** as the most actionable clinical approach. It is most impactful in severe asthma, where it enables precision biologic therapy and improves outcomes [^112teAKi].

### Asthma phenotypes [^116QGrbF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder presenting with many phenotypes. Precise phenotypic definition has eluded the medical research community for years, despite recognition of different disease subtypes. Improved phenotypic characterization and knowledge of underlying pathobiology is necessary for linkage of specific genotypes with clinical disease manifestations.

Recent Findings

Phenotyping has been difficult because asthma is likely to be comprised of overlapping syndromes with varying origins and heterogeneous pathobiology. Currently, the field is too reliant on classification by trigger or symptoms. Since genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity are inherent in asthma, patients presenting with different asthma phenotypes may need tailored therapies. Studies have begun to link genetics with disease mechanism and therapeutic response. As disease etiology, onset, progression and severity vary greatly among patients, however, the relative contribution of genetic factors may be difficult to ascertain. Definition of the full array of complex biological consequences of molecular target modulation is a prerequisite for therapies based on this concept.

Summary

The advent of targeted therapies for asthma and clinical trials based on phenotype and genotype have raised interest in more accurate description of asthma phenotypes. Therapies based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics may be useful in asthma management. A variety of factors, however, must be addressed before such approaches become standard.

### Severe asthma phenotypes-how should they guide evaluation and treatment? [^116t2otv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Although patients with "severe" asthma tend to be characterized by ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite treatment with high doses of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, there is increasing recognition of marked phenotypic heterogeneity within affected patients. Although "precision medicine" approaches for patients with severe asthma are needed, there are many hurdles that must be overcome in daily practice. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) has been at the forefront of phenotype discovery in severe asthma for the past decade. SARP, along with other international groups, has described clinical severe asthma phenotypes in both adults and children that can be evaluated in the clinical setting. Although these clinical phenotypes provide a good "starting point" for addressing disease heterogeneity in severe asthma in everyday practice, more efforts are needed to understand how these phenotypes relate to underlying disease mechanisms and pharmacological treatment responses. This review highlights the clinical asthma phenotypes identified to date, their associations with underlying endotypes and potential biomarkers, and remaining knowledge gaps that must be addressed before precision medicine can become a reality for patients with severe asthma.

### Asthma: defining of the persistent adult phenotypes [^115VFx2t]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The common disease asthma is probably not a single disease, but rather a complex of multiple, separate syndromes that overlap. Although clinicians have recognised these different phenotypes for many years, they have remained poorly characterised, with little known about the underlying pathobiology contributing to them. Development of targeted therapies for asthma, and phenotype-specific clinical trials have raised interest in these phenotypes. Improved understanding of these phenotypes in complex diseases such as asthma will also improve our ability to link specific genotypes to their associated disease, which should help development of biomarkers. However, there is no standardised method to define asthma phenotypes. This Review analyses some of the methods that have been used to define asthma phenotypes and proposes an integrated method of classification to improve our understanding of these phenotypes.

### Untangling asthma phenotypes and endotypes [^112SvjPH]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma phenotypes have been developed to address the complexities of the disease. However, owing to a lack of longitudinal studies, little is known about the onset as well as the stability of phenotypes. Distinguishing phenotypes with regard to the severity or duration of the disease is essential. A phenotype covers the clinically relevant properties of the disease, but does not show the direct relationship to disease etiology and pathophysiology. Different pathogenetic mechanisms might cause similar asthma symptoms and might be operant in a certain phenotype. These putative mechanisms are addressed by the term 'endotype'. Classification of asthma based on endotypes provides advantages for epidemiological, genetic, and drug-related studies. A successful definition of endotypes should link key pathogenic mechanisms with the asthma phenotype. Thus, the identification of corresponding molecular biomarkers for individual pathogenic mechanism underlying phenotypes or subgroups within a phenotype is important. Whether newly defined asthma endotypes predict the individual course of asthma has to be validated in longitudinal studies. The accurate endotyping reflects natural history of asthma and should help to predict treatment response. Thus, understanding asthma endotypes might be useful in clinical practice.

### Biomarkers in asthmatic patients: has their time come to direct treatment? [^117SSxmH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes that have variable risk factors and responses to therapeutics. Mild-to-moderate asthma often responds to traditional medications, whereas severe disease can be refractory to inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. There is robust research into the variable phenotypes of asthma. Biomarkers help define the specific pathophysiology of different asthma phenotypes and identify potential therapeutic targets. The following review will discuss the current use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of asthma, triaging the severity of a patient's disease, and the potential efficacy of treatments. This information can be used to define certain patient populations that are more likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroids or biologics. As knowledge of patient phenotypes and endotypes and biological agents to target specific classes of asthma emerge, the ability to provide personalized care to asthmatic patients will follow.

### Asthma phenotypes: the evolution from clinical to molecular approaches [^112kWU6e]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although asthma has been considered as a single disease for years, recent studies have increasingly focused on its heterogeneity. The characterization of this heterogeneity has promoted the concept that asthma consists of multiple phenotypes or consistent groupings of characteristics. Asthma phenotypes were initially focused on combinations of clinical characteristics, but they are now evolving to link biology to phenotype, often through a statistically based process. Ongoing studies of large-scale, molecularly and genetically focused and extensively clinically characterized cohorts of asthma should enhance our ability to molecularly understand these phenotypes and lead to more targeted and personalized approaches to asthma therapy.

### Recent advances in severe asthma: from phenotypes to personalized medicine [^114P4jvL]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on recent clinical and translational discoveries in severe and uncontrolled asthma that now enable phenotyping and personalized therapies in these patients. Although asthma is common in both children and adults and typically responds to standard therapies, a subset of individuals with asthma experience severe and/or persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapies. Airflow obstruction leading to frequent symptoms requiring higher levels of controller therapy is the cardinal feature of severe asthma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms, or endotypes, are diverse and variable between individuals. Two major risk factors that contribute to severe asthma are genetics and environmental exposures that modulate immune responses, and although these often interact in complex manners that are not fully understood, certain endotypes converge in severe asthma. A number of studies have evaluated various features of patients with severe asthma and classified patients into phenotypes with clinical relevance. This phenotyping is now incorporated into clinical practice and can be used to guide advanced biological therapies that target specific molecules and inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma pathogenesis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114Rshjo]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — clinical asthma phenotypes and biomarkers: Recognizable clusters of demographic and clinical characteristics are called 'clinical asthma phenotypes'; in most instances, these do not correlate strongly with specific pathological processes or treatment responses. However, biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes are useful in the assessment of difficult-to-treat asthma and treatment of severe asthma.

---

### Use of biomarkers to identify phenotypes and endotypes of severe asthma [^116eXEVE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Severe asthma can be classified into phenotypes and endotypes, which may inform clinicians about inflammatory pathways leading to disease and ultimately guide optimal therapeutic strategy. Biomarkers, objectively measurable characteristics of the disease, are of increasing interest to clinicians and researchers as powerful tools to distinguish among the severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The objective of this review is to highlight current knowledge of biomarker applications to identify phenotypes and endotypes of severe asthma.

Data Sources

Sources used include observational cohorts, clinical trials, translational studies, comprehensive reviews, and expert/taskforce statements.

Study Selections

Included studies were selected for their relevance to the topic and for strength of data or study design.

Results

In severe asthma, biomarkers can be used for diagnosis of phenotype or endotype, can also be predictive of clinical outcomes or response to therapy, and may be dynamic with time or therapy. Fully determining phenotype or endotype of severe asthma will require interpretation of combinations of commercially available biomarkers.

Conclusion

Biomarkers have multiple potential clinical applications in severe asthma. Novel biomarkers may add accuracy to this field.

### Evolving concepts of asthma [^111xR4uK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our understanding of asthma has evolved over time from a singular disease to a complex of various phenotypes, with varied natural histories, physiologies, and responses to treatment. Early therapies treated most patients with asthma similarly, with bronchodilators and corticosteroids, but these therapies had varying degrees of success. Similarly, despite initial studies that identified an underlying type 2 inflammation in the airways of patients with asthma, biologic therapies targeted toward these type 2 pathways were unsuccessful in all patients. These observations led to increased interest in phenotyping asthma. Clinical approaches, both biased and later unbiased/statistical approaches to large asthma patient cohorts, identified a variety of patient characteristics, but they also consistently identified the importance of age of onset of disease and the presence of eosinophils in determining clinically relevant phenotypes. These paralleled molecular approaches to phenotyping that developed an understanding that not all patients share a type 2 inflammatory pattern. Using biomarkers to select patients with type 2 inflammation, repeated trials of biologics directed toward type 2 cytokine pathways saw newfound success, confirming the importance of phenotyping in asthma. Further research is needed to clarify additional clinical and molecular phenotypes, validate predictive biomarkers, and identify new areas for possible interventions.

### Developing and emerging clinical asthma phenotypes [^112aZnyg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

For more than a century, clinicians have attempted to subdivide asthma into different phenotypes based on triggers that cause asthma attacks, the course of the disease, or the prognosis. The first phenotypes that were described included allergic asthma, intrinsic or nonallergic asthma, infectious asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated asthma. These phenotypes are being reviewed elsewhere in this issue of the journal. The present article focuses on developing and emerging clinical asthma phenotypes. First, asthma phenotypes that are associated with environmental exposures (occupational agents, cigarette smoke, air pollution, cold dry air); second, asthma phenotypes that are associated with specific symptoms or clinical characteristics (cough, obesity, adult onset of disease); and third, asthma phenotypes that are based on biomarkers. This latter approach is the most promising because it attempts to identify asthma phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms so that therapies can be better targeted toward disease-specific features and disease outcomes can be improved.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: a Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^114uZETV]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of asthma based on history and objective measures of lung function in patients old enough to reliably undergo pulmonary function tests.

### Phenotyping of severe asthma in the era of broad-acting anti-asthma biologics [^117NcBWd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite the maximal use of inhaled corticosteroids and additional controller medications, and has a high economic burden. Biologic therapies are recommended for the management of severe, uncontrolled asthma to help to prevent exacerbations and to improve symptoms and health-related quality of life. The effective management of severe asthma requires consideration of clinical heterogeneity that is driven by varying clinical and inflammatory phenotypes, which are reflective of distinct underlying disease mechanisms. Phenotyping patients using a combination of clinical characteristics such as the age of onset or comorbidities and biomarker profiles, including blood eosinophil counts and levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and serum total immunoglobulin E, is important for the differential diagnosis of asthma. In addition, phenotyping is beneficial for risk assessment, selection of treatment, and monitoring of the treatment response in patients with asthma. This review describes the clinical and inflammatory phenotypes of asthma, provides an overview of biomarkers routinely used in clinical practice and those that have recently been explored for phenotyping, and aims to assess the value of phenotyping in severe asthma management in the current era of biologics.

### Unraveling the heterogeneity of asthma: decoding subtypes of asthma [^111GEo1Z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with diverse underlying mechanisms contributing to disease susceptibility and progression. Asthma endotypes and phenotypes have emerged as critical frameworks to help understand the variation in disease presentation and response to therapies. Phenotypes are the observable characteristics or traits of an organism that are produced by the interaction of genotype and environment. Asthma endotypes are distinct subsets of asthma that are characterized by specific biologic pathways, including differences in inflammatory pathways, genetic predisposition, and immune response. Identifying asthma endotypes and the associated clinical phenotypes is pivotal for the development of personalized treatment strategies, as it enables clinicians to select more effective therapies based on specific biologic mechanisms. This review explores asthma endotypes and their associated phenotypes and the ongoing effort to refine diagnostic tools and therapeutic personalized approaches, aiming to improve outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Asthma endotypes: a new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome [^117N7YSx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

It is increasingly clear that asthma is a complex disease made up of number of disease variants with different underlying pathophysiologies. Limited knowledge of the mechanisms of these disease subgroups is possibly the greatest obstacle in understanding the causes of asthma and improving treatment and can explain the failure to identify consistent genetic and environmental correlations to asthma. Here we describe a hypothesis whereby the asthma syndrome is divided into distinct disease entities with specific mechanisms, which we have called "asthma endotypes". An "endotype" is proposed to be a subtype of a condition defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Criteria for defining asthma endotypes on the basis of their phenotypes and putative pathophysiology are suggested. Using these criteria, we identify several proposed asthma endotypes and propose how these new definitions can be used in clinical study design and drug development to target existing and novel therapies to patients most likely to benefit. This PRACTALL (PRACtical ALLergy) consensus report was produced by experts from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

### Phenotypes of refractory / severe asthma [^112hjFD2]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

The acid test of phenotyping is that it leads either to a clinically useful or mechanistically important insight. Phenotypes may change over time, but the exact definition of a phenotype shift is unclear. Methods of phenotyping are either investigator driven, in which a priori prejudices are applied to the data, or (semi) objective, in which mathematical techniques or systems biology approaches are applied to the dataset. However, the composition of the dataset is driven by investigator prejudice. Phenotyping is likely most useful in severe asthma, because mild and moderate asthma responds to simple treatments, and no great subtlety is required. Our non-evidence based approach is to define the subpopulation of genuine severe, therapy-resistant asthmatics from the generality of problematic severe asthma. We then investigate them invasively with bronchoscopy and a steroid trial using intramuscular triamcinolone to determine the nature of any inflammatory process; whether inflammation and symptoms are concordant or discordant; whether the inflammatory process is steroid resistant or sensitive; and whether the child has persistent airflow limitation. Other possibly relevant phenotypes include the child with severe exacerbations; brittle asthma; and severe asthma with fungal sensitization. Severe, therapy resistant asthma is a disparate disease, and only international uniform approaches, carefully characterising the children as a prelude to focussed clinical trials will allow progress to be made, and vindicate (or otherwise) our suggested approach.

### Diagnosis of asthma in symptomatic children based on measures of lung function: an analysis of data from a population-based birth cohort study [^112FRaLM]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Asthma is an umbrella term that includes several phenotypes (which are better characterised in adults than in children); however, at present, the diagnosis is made before any phenotyping and treatment pathways are not dependent on phenotyping for most children with mild-to-moderate asthma. Diagnostic algorithms might need to allow for different patterns of lung function to capture all types of asthma. We recognise that we have tested this algorithm in a population of adolescents (aged 13–16 years) and that this age range is not fully representative of the paediatric population. Results in younger children might reveal different strengths and weaknesses of this algorithm and future prospective studies should aim to include children from age 5–6 years upwards.

We believe that our study makes an important contribution to knowledge in this difficult area. Our findings suggest an urgent need exists for appropriately designed studies to generate evidence about the value of different tests for the diagnosis of paediatric asthma in primary care. Until such evidence is available, the proposed NICE guidance on asthma diagnosis should not be implemented in children.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113jNTUe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on mild asthma — mild asthma is believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma, is variably defined with common usage referring to infrequent symptoms, and patients can face an underappreciated exacerbation burden with increased risk for impaired quality of life, accelerated lung function decline, and oral corticosteroid exposure; a panel evaluated existing literature and made recommendations for future research, and this document is meant to be a roadmap for future research and not a clinical guideline for patient care. The statement suggests research priorities in various mild asthma–related areas, including definition of mild asthma (conduct surveys of physician and patient perspectives and develop a consensus definition with utility for patients, clinicians, and researchers), phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms (investigate inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, describe phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, and assess whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly corticosteroid responsive phenotype), and disease progression and exacerbations (conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify the frequency of and risk factors for progression to more severe disease and monitor long-term outcomes of patients followed exclusively by primary care providers, while evaluating patient factors influencing the exacerbation reduction effects of mild asthma therapies).

### Severe asthma: from characteristics to phenotypes to endotypes [^115modJg]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma, and severe asthma, in particular, is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease. While traditional views of asthma have centered around a childhood onset disease with an allergic component, several large scale network studies are now confirming that severe asthma can present in multiple different ways, only 30–50% of which meet traditional childhood onset allergic criteria. To understand the different groups better, initial studies have attempted to define phenotypes of severe asthma. A phenotype is defined as the integration of different characteristics that are the product of the interaction of the patient's genes with the environment. Both clinical and statistical approaches have identified at least 3–5 phenotypes of severe asthma. However, these phenotypes, in isolation, do not identify the immunopathology that makes these clinical phenotypes distinct or identifies a target population for a specific approach to therapy. As biological characteristics are identified, phenotypes should continue to evolve towards asthma endotypes. The identification of these endotypes, either by matching biology, genetics and therapeutic responses to therapy with clinically or statistically defined phenotypes or through unbiased genetic and genomic approaches, remains limited. Moving forward, this integration of genetics, biology and clinical characteristics should substantially enhance our ability to effectively treat complex heterogeneous diseases, such as severe asthma.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^1179Ex8n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease in which the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Patients are often grouped into phenotypes (based on clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics) and endotypes (based on distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms). Recently, patients with asthma have been broadly split into 2 phenotypes based on their levels of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non-type 2 asthma. However, this approach is likely oversimplified, and our understanding of the non-type 2 mechanisms in asthma remains extremely limited. A better understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes may assist in development of drugs for new therapeutic targets in asthma. One approach is to identify "treatable traits", which are specific patient characteristics related to phenotypes and endotypes that can be targeted by therapies. This review will focus on emerging treatable traits in asthma and aim to describe novel patient subgroups and endotypes that may represent the next step in the search for new therapeutic approaches.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^111hpxsR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease with variable clinical manifestations. Patients with common clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics (phenotypes) are grouped together to guide diagnosis, therapy, and management of asthma. However, patients within a given phenotype can show heterogeneity of disease severity and response to therapy, prompting the need for more specific disease classifications. Recently, the term endotype has been introduced to define patients with asthma by distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying asthma pathology. Approaches based on endotypes and phenotypes have been proposed to optimally manage patients with asthma.

Classifying patients into phenotypes and endotypes can direct treatment toward targeting specific pathophysiologic pathways that may be dysregulated in a given phenotype or endotype. For example, asthma has been broadly split into 2 distinct phenotypes according to the degree of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. Of these 2 phenotypes, type 2 asthma is the better understood and more easily identifiable in patients: eosinophilic inflammation and IgE synthesis both play a key role. Non–type 2 asthma is less easily defined and may comprise several subpopulations (distinct phenotypes and endotypes) of patients with non–type 2 asthma. However, because of the heterogeneity found in asthma, there are also likely to be patients whose asthma is driven by both type 2 and non–type 2 inflammatory mechanisms. Specific mechanisms may contribute to severe asthma in certain patients who do not respond to therapies targeting type 2 asthma alone. A greater understanding of the phenotypes and endotypes involved in asthma pathology will help to identify patients who are more to likely benefit from established or novel or emerging targeted therapies.

Table 3 — Research needs for mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms — Knowledge gaps include clinical outcomes of different mild asthma phenotypes including specific populations; the stability of mild asthma phenotypes; which phenotypes are at greater risk; the role of eosinophils in mild asthma regarding pathology, associated risks, and outcomes; other inflammatory pathways of mild asthma and whether/how they differ from those in more severe disease; and optimal study designs. Suggested research includes investigating inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, conducting cluster analyses to elucidate heterogeneity, describing phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including AHR, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, assessing whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly CS responsive phenotype, conducting large epidemiological studies on blood eosinophils and breath analysis, and characterizing stability of inflammatory markers/phenotypes across environmental triggers; CS = corticosteroid.

### How to compare the efficacy of biologic agents in asthma [^117DtY5v]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The use of biologics in severe asthma has made substantial strides in disease management and fostered a personalized medicine approach; however, how, when, and which biologic to choose are unresolved issues, which form the focus of this review.

Data Sources

The data sources were published literature, including current guidelines, available through PubMed searches and online resources.

Study Selections

Studies and randomized controlled trials pertaining to the use of biologics in various phenotypes and/or endotypes of asthma and comparative analyses between biologics in asthma were included.

Results

Inflammatory constructs in asthma are complex and translate differentially into clinical practice for both disease severity and treatment responsiveness. The utilization of biologics, which target selected components of inflammation, has begun to dramatically improve the course of management for many patients with severe asthma. A retuning of our approach into selecting appropriate patient cohorts or phenotypes for studies and selection of clinically relevant outcomes, which are reflected by existing and novel emerging biomarkers, is enabling a paradigm shift in asthma management. Comparing the efficacy of the available biologics for asthma is challenging as no direct head-to-head studies are available, and indirect comparisons to this query provide varying results.

Conclusion

Significant progress has been achieved in the management of severe asthma with treatment of target-specific biologics. Sophisticated algorithms and trial designs, using a combination of available biomarker profiles and clinical characteristics to stratify patient populations into more precise subphenotypes and endotypes to guide our choice of a biologic or therapy, are critically needed but currently not formulated.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the asthmas [^111mun6e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimizing asthma diagnosis is an essential part of global strategies to reduce the excessive illness burden from asthma. New understanding about how to address the complexity and heterogeneity of the different forms of asthma means that asthma diagnosis now requires a compound diagnostic approach and label. Eliciting the typical symptoms and abnormal physiology of variable airflow limitation permits the recognition of asthma, and the identification of further features, such as eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation, allows a compound diagnostic label of eosinophilic asthma. This conveys key information about future exacerbation risk and likely treatment responsiveness. Treatable traits are a useful way to implement this new approach to diagnosis. Targeted assessment is used to inform a specific treatment plan in a pragmatic and iterative process.

### Phenotyping of difficult asthma using longitudinal physiological and biomarker measurements reveals significant differences in stability between clusters [^1121wmx2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that focusing on identifying clusters of patients by measuring patients at any one given time-point may be unreliable. Perhaps the use of endotypes will permit more meaningful characterization and true personalization of asthma management. Future work will consider using information from more than one time point to identify phenotypes.

Future studies are needed to evaluate the use of phenotypes prospectively to screen individuals at risk for adverse future outcomes and to improve asthma control by personalizing asthma management. The significant role of subject-reported outcomes such as ACQ indicates a strong need for primary care services to ensure optimal management of asthma, to prevent exacerbations and to reduce the long-term burden of this disease.

### Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide the treatment of asthma: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114smLa9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Remarks

Despite nearly 10 years of research since the initial guidelines in this area were published, the available data from randomized control trials remain fairly limited, and some of the selected outcome measures may not have had adequate power to detect a difference. The consensus of the group was that F NO -based care provides the clinician with a simple and noninvasive point-of-care test that provides complementary information over usual care and that the undesirable effects were small relative to the potential benefit. Given the relatively modest effect sizes and statistical significance, it is reasonable for individual groups of providers to weigh the potential costs and administrative burden relative to the benefits outlined in this guideline. In addition to providers, stakeholders such as individuals with asthma, payors, and the Food and Drug Administration could reasonably grade other outcomes such as quality of life and symptom-free days as a higher priority.

The recommendation places a high value on asthma exacerbations and reduction in need for oral corticosteroid use, which were categorized as critical outcome measures by this panel and other groups. Although the balance of desirable and undesirable effects probably favored the intervention, it was noted by the group that usual asthma care has evolved over the past few years. Although phenotyping and endotyping asthma have become paramount in asthma management, there have been no studies to look at the additional benefit of adding F NO testing once an asthma phenotype has already been classified, although there is some evidence that F NO testing can be used as an assessment tool for the use of biologics. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether there are subgroups in which F NO measurement should not be used because the intervention may not be cost-effective or beneficial for achieving the desired outcomes.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

### Different endotypes and phenotypes drive the heterogeneity in severe asthma [^112kJMzt]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

The identification of sputum eosinophilia indicating corticosteroid responsiveness in subjects with severe asthma heralded the beginning of phenotyping asthmatic subjects based on airways inflammation. Since then, the heterogeneity of severe asthma has been explored and the importance of immunobiology has come sharply into focus with the identification of the key type-2 cytokine pathways driving eosinophilic inflammation. The development of molecules targeting these type-2 pathways has transformed severe asthma treatment, but necessitates robust clinical evaluation, biomarker profiling and assessment of comorbid factors to identify subjects most likely to benefit from these therapies. It has also become clear that targeting these pathways does not eradicate asthma symptoms and exacerbation risk; further work is needed to clarify underlying non-type-2 mechanisms in severe asthma pathways and possible therapeutic targets. This review addresses progress to date in clinical assessment and management of severe asthma and some of the challenges and unmet needs in severe asthma to achieve the goal of delivering individualized patient care.

### Phenotypic characterization of severe asthma [^117PJBqq]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent literature that informs our understanding of severe asthma. Severe asthma is an increasingly important part of specialty practice, is responsible for disproportionate healthcare utilization, and contributes significantly to the costs of care. Better recognition of this subset of asthma can lead to improved healthcare.

Recent Findings

Key recent observations in severe asthma include demographic characterizations of several large study populations and the increasing understanding that relative steroid resistance is a virtually universal feature. In addition, strong associations with interleukin-13 and mammalian chitinase have emerged, and abnormalities of endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways have been examined. The role of protein biomarkers to identify and delineate severe asthma is now being investigated. The pathogenic significance of each of these observations is still being clarified, but it appears that severe asthma may have mechanistic underpinnings distinct from that of mild or moderate asthma.

Summary

Severe asthma is a discrete, but variably defined phenotype of asthma. Steroid resistance is extremely common, patients may require doses of inhaled steroids for control that exceed usual guidelines and may also require multiple controller agents. New mechanistic insights could provide important avenues for novel therapeutic interventions.

### Understanding asthma phenotypes, endotypes, and mechanisms of disease [^115WDaUr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The model of asthma as a single entity has now been replaced by a much more complex biological network of distinct and interrelating inflammatory pathways. The term asthma is now considered an umbrella diagnosis for several diseases with distinct mechanistic pathways (endotypes) and variable clinical presentations (phenotypes). The precise definition of these endotypes is central to asthma management due to inherent therapeutic and prognostic implications. This review presents the molecular mechanisms behind the heterogeneity of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. Asthma endotypes may be broadly regarded as type 2 (T2) high or T2-low. Several biologic agents have been approved for T2-high asthma, with numerous other therapeutics that are incipient and similarly targeted at specific molecular mechanisms. Collectively, these advances have shifted existing paradigms in the approach to asthma to tailor novel therapies.

### Asthma management: a new phenotype-based approach using presence of eosinophilia and allergy [^111v7e9J]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. The Czech Pneumology and Allergology Societies commissioned 10 experts to review the literature and create joint national guidelines for managing asthma, reflecting this heterogeneity. The aim was to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic strategy as a rational approach to the widening opportunities for the use of phenotype-targeted therapy. The guidelines were presented on websites for public comments by members of both the societies. The reviewers' comments contributed to creating the final version of the guidelines. The key hallmark of the diagnostic approach is the pragmatic concept, which assesses the presence of allergy and eosinophilia in each asthmatic patient. The guidelines define three clinically relevant asthma phenotypes: eosinophilic allergic asthma, eosinophilic nonallergic asthma and noneosinophilic nonallergic asthma. The resulting multifunctional classification describing the severity, level of control and phenotype is the starting point for a comprehensive treatment strategy. The level of control is constantly confronted with the intensity of the common stepwise pharmacotherapy, and the concurrently included phenotyping is essential for phenotype-specific therapy. The concept of the asthma approach with assessing the presence of eosinophilia and allergy provides a way for more precise diagnosis, which is a prerequisite for using widening options of personalized therapy.

Key messages

What are the characteristics of asthma in an African cohort including severity, phenotypes, medication exposure and risk factors?
The prevalence of severe and uncontrolled asthma was very high in a setting where access to conventional therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids is significantly limited.
In this study, we successfully performed phenotypic characterisation of asthma in an African cohort that included both clinical factors and biomarkers. This is the first report of asthma severity and phenotypes in an East African cohort and this manuscript provides valuable insights into the prevalence of severe asthma, the risk factors for poorly controlled disease and the inflammatory phenotypes of patients in this unique cohort. It highlights the lack of access to therapies that have the potential to significantly impact asthma outcomes in a meaningful way.

### Features of asthma which provide meaningful insights for understanding the disease heterogeneity [^114Fodfj]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The evidence is mounting that asthma is an umbrella diagnosis for a collection of distinct diseases (endotypes), with varying phenotypic expression of characteristic symptoms (ranging from wheezing and shortness of breath, to cough and chest tightness), and accompanying variable airflow obstruction. 1, 2, 3 It is important to make a clear distinction between asthma phenotypes (which are observable and measured characteristics of the disease) 4 and asthma endotypes (which is a term that refers to the subtype of the disease with a clearly defined underlying mechanism). 1, 2, 5 It is of note that similar symptoms and observable features can arise through different pathophysiological mechanisms and that consequently different endotypes may have similar, or even the same phenotype. Identifying true endotypes of asthma and their underlying mechanisms is a prerequisite for achieving better mechanism‐based treatment targeting, and ultimately delivery of genuinely stratified medicine in asthma. 5 However, although the current consensus in the medical community is that different asthma endotypes do exist, there is little agreement on what these are and how best to define them. 6

Approaches utilized in the search for asthma endotypes have ranged from investigator‐led pattern identification, in the clinical setting, to supervised and unsupervised statistical modelling techniques that utilize large amounts of data and computer algorithms to find the latent (hidden, unknown a‐priori) patterns of observable features (such as symptoms, medication use, allergic sensitization, lung function), either in cross‐sectional studies 7, 8, 9, 10 or over time. Data‐driven approaches allow interrogation of data without imposing a‐priori hypotheses, hence eliminating investigator bias and enabling novel hypotheses to be generated. 6 In most previous studies which used such approaches, the selection of variables used for subtype discovery was either pre‐determined by clinical advice, 7, 9, 11 or by the use of statistical data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). 8, 12, 13 Although valuable information has been gained, and there was some (but not complete) resemblance between the results, most studies reported different disease clusters; several recent reviews have summarized these findings. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 These inconsistencies may be explained by the inherent heterogeneity among different populations, the differences in clustering techniques used, the lack of consistency in selecting variables, their encodings and transformations, or the use of excessive numbers of variables which may result in subtype "signals" being drowned in the noise. 19

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^1112Bw9o]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Until the early 2010s, the asthmatologist's role in the severe asthma clinic was largely that of a "corticosteroid-ologist". In this capacity, we studied the inevitable airway and people remodelling in chronically debilitated patients with asthma, with the uncomfortable suspicion that a portion of the morbidity was the result of corticosteroids — substances known for both their efficacy and toxicity. Thankfully, the advent of multiple different monoclonal antibodies to treat people with asthma has translated to extraordinary benefits for patients, and a less uncomfortable workday for the asthmatologist. An important aspect of today's job involves phenotyping patients clinically (by looking for patient characteristics and comorbidities) and endotyping objectively (by measuring type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) to decipher the underlying mechanisms of their airway disease, estimating the risk of asthma attacks and lung function decline, and most importantly, offering a precision-based approach by choosing the right treatment for the right patient. As the variety of biologic therapies increases and now includes six biologics spanning four different mechanisms of action, the latter task is increasingly complicated.

In a previous instalment of the severe asthma How I Do It series about the workup of severe asthma, we proposed a "two-hit model" by which blood eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide (F) identify different components and compartments of the inflammatory response. We elaborated on the increasing volume of evidence that allergy testing and serum IgE have poor prognostic and theragnostic value in asthma; we reviewed the complementary value of type-2 inflammatory biomarkers (blood eosinophils and F), spirometry, and adherence checking, and we emphasized the importance of evaluating and managing treatable type 2 comorbidities.

In this installment, we tackle how different phenotypic characteristics can help us to find the right biologic for the right patient. In complement to recent comprehensiveand usefulreviews on the currently authorized biologics that we list in Table 1, we use case studies highlighting four different sets of clinical scenarios and biomarker values to discuss features influencing our choice of targeted therapy.

### The microbiome in allergic disease: current understanding and future opportunities-2017 PRACTALL document of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^112rQEVQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Asthma and allergic disease microbiome — key knowledge gaps, phenotype links, and research priorities are outlined: There is strong evidence that very early-life factors shape allergy and asthma risk in childhood, and heterogeneity creates challenges and opportunities, and it is now recognized that a significant proportion of adult asthma is not driven by type 2 airway inflammation. Emerging evidence links asthma-associated respiratory microbiome alterations to diminished type 2 airway inflammation and diminished response to corticosteroids, and the microbiota–phenotype link includes different patterns of airway microbial enrichment associated with obesity or stability of asthma control in patients with severe asthma. Such studies require thoughtful prospective design and execution with attention to clinical phenotyping and microbiome-specific sample collection/processing, and acquiring and analyzing host cells from the same tissue as the microbiome (in vitro or in vivo) is an important step toward testing causality. Major gaps include a dearth of knowledge on microbiome stability in adults and the lower respiratory tract; longitudinal observational studies are challenging but important to establish foundational knowledge. Given massive and varied data types, analysis will require novel integrative approaches, such as systems biology or machine-learning methods, and current evidence indicates a very early window of opportunity to minimize the risk of childhood asthma or atopy, while how and when to intervene therapeutically remains a difficult question.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^112teAKi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and effective management of asthma, and in particular severe asthma, remains at the core of pulmonary practice. Over the last 20–30 years, there has been increasing appreciation that "severe asthma" encompasses multiple different subgroups or phenotypes, each with differing presentations. Using clinical phenotyping, in combination with rapidly advancing molecular tools and targeted monoclonal antibodies (human knockouts), the understanding of these phenotypes, and our ability to treat them, have greatly advanced. Type-2 (T2)-high and -low severe asthmas are now easily identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current "breakthrough" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated. Nevertheless, conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" has evolved dramatically in a mere 25 years, leading to dramatic improvements in the lives of many.

### Longitudinal outcomes of different asthma phenotypes in primary care, an observational study [^117TYYDK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Further research should focus on the implementation of phenotype usage in primary care. Firstly it must be assessed how to easily define a particular patients' phenotype within current asthma management and how often this should be repeated in order to continually improve long-term asthma outcomes. Also, while we did show long-term outcomes are different for phenotypes, it is currently not certain that changing therapy according to this knowledge will actually lead to improved outcomes. Although this seems likely, a future prospective study is needed, which could also assess the consequences of implementing phenotypes in general practices, since if it is time-consuming while real life impact on long-term outcomes are negligible, use of phenotypes is questionable.

### Asthma phenotypes and biomarkers [^113weJcE]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma experienced by both adults and children is a phenotypically heterogeneous condition. Severe asthma, characterized by ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite high doses of inhaled and/or systemic corticosteroids, is the focus of research efforts to understand this underlying heterogeneity. Clinical phenotypes in both adult and pediatric asthma have been determined using supervised definition-driven classification and unsupervised data-driven clustering methods. Efforts to understand the underlying inflammatory patterns of severe asthma have led to the seminal discovery of type 2-high versus type 2-low phenotypes and to the development of biologics targeted at type 2-high inflammation to reduce the rates of severe asthma exacerbations. Type 2-high asthma is characterized by upregulation of T helper 2 immune pathways including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 along with eosinophilic airway inflammation, sometimes allergic sensitization, and responsiveness to treatment with corticosteroids. Type 2-low asthma is poorly responsive to corticosteroids and is not as well characterized as type 2-high asthma. Type 2-low asthma is limited by being defined as the absence of type 2-high inflammatory markers. Choosing a biologic for the treatment of severe asthma involves the evaluation of a panel of biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, total and specific immunoglobulin E/allergic sensitization, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. In this review, we focus on the underlying pathobiology of adult and pediatric asthma, discuss the different phenotype-based treatment options for adult and pediatric type 2-high with or without allergic asthma and type 2-low asthma, and describe a clinical phenotyping approach to patients to guide out-patient therapy. Finally, we end with a discussion of whether pediatric asthma exacerbations necessitating admission to an ICU constitute their own high-risk phenotype and/or whether it is a part of other previously defined high-risk subgroups such as difficult-to-control asthma, exacerbation-prone asthma, and severe treatment-resistant asthma.

American Thoracic Society research statement — current challenges in mild asthma research include a lack of a reliable definition (the current definition is based on arbitrary cut offs and is not reliable or valid), suboptimal understanding of heterogeneity (inadequate understanding of mild asthma phenotypes and endotypes and failure to better understand variability in treatment responses), a lack of perceived research needs (no prior initiative from major societies and issues pertaining to lack of funding opportunities), methodological challenges (challenges with consistent inclusion and exclusions criteria and lack of standardized mild asthma outcomes to research), and issues stemming from the patient perspective (patient needs are not consistently factored into current study designs and recruitment issues based on patient perception of "mild" disease).

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^113wCbqY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Integrated approaches including clinical and molecular phenotyping in relation to responses to biologic therapy have remarkably improved our understanding of the phenotypes, and even endotypes, of the severe asthmas. Patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on medium- to high-dose ICSs, despite standard approaches, should be biologically phenotyped into T2-Hi or T2-Lo categories through measurement and monitoring of blood eosinophils and F NO in relation to their age at onset. However, details of the immune cells and their drivers in relation to these phenotypes remain to be better understood, and many patients, especially those with T2-Hi asthma in association with other immune factors, or T2-Lo asthma, are still poorly treated. Concerted study of biology, immune pathways, and clinical outcomes, with deference to specific therapies, is needed to continue to improve the understanding and treatment of the severe asthmas.

### Systematic review of clinical prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care [^112RRQ4P]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Making an accurate diagnosis of asthma is fundamental to improving asthma care and outcomes. However, asthma is commonly misdiagnosed, with over- and under-diagnosis of asthma in children and adults reported. – Over-diagnosis leads to costly, potentially harmful treatment and unnecessary health care, whilst under-diagnosis risks inadequate treatment and avoidable morbidity and mortality.

Accurately diagnosing asthma is challenging. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease comprising different genotypes, endotypes and phenotypes. There is no 'gold' reference standard that can categorically confirm or refute the diagnosis. Asthma is thus a clinical diagnosis, but individual symptoms, signs and tests have poor sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis. Uncertainty about the best combination of clinical features and tests for asthma diagnosis is reflected in conflicting recommendations between national, and internationalguidelines and highlighted in commentaries seeking to reduce confusion for clinicians.

One solution could be to use a clinical prediction model, a data-driven algorithm that combines at least two predictors, such as elements from a clinical history, physical examination, test results and/or response to treatment, to estimate the probability that an outcome is present. Clinical prediction models can assist healthcare professionals to weigh up the probability of a diagnosis, enhance shared decision-making and aid patient stratification into subtypes. As most asthma diagnoses occur in non-specialist settings, where health problems typically present in an undifferentiated manner, and assessment is often based on probability, a prediction model could increase the accuracy of asthma diagnosis by supporting the appraisal of available clinical information and guiding next steps.

We aimed to identify, compare and synthesise existing clinical prediction models designed to support the diagnosis of asthma in children and adults presenting with symptoms suggestive of asthma in primary care or equivalent settings.

### Longitudinal outcomes of different asthma phenotypes in primary care, an observational study [^113YHDob]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clustering of primary care asthma patients resulted in five distinct phenotypes. These phenotypes differ in long-term outcomes, as measured by ACQ, AQLQ, exacerbation frequency and medication usage. Using these phenotypes in asthma treatment may result in a personalisation of treatment, based on individual long-term outcomes.

### Phenotypes and endotypes of adult asthma: moving toward precision medicine [^115Tc3fc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is challenging to dissect into subgroups because of the heterogeneity present across the spectrum of the disease. Efforts to subclassify asthma using advanced computational methods have identified a number of different phenotypes that suggest that multiple pathobiologically driven clusters of disease exist. The main phenotypes that have been identified include (1) early-onset allergic asthma, (2) early-onset allergic moderate-to-severe remodeled asthma, (3) late-onset nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, and (4) late-onset nonallergic noneosinophilic asthma. Subgroups of these phenotypes also exist but have not been as consistently identified. Advances in our understanding of the diverse immunologic perturbations that drive airway inflammation are consistent with clinical traits associated with these phenotypes and their response to biologic therapies. This has improved the clinician's approach to characterizing asthmatic patients in the clinic. Being able to define asthma endotypes using clinical characteristics and biomarkers will move physicians toward even more personalized management of asthma and precision-based care in the future. Here we will review the most prominent phenotypes and immunologic advances that suggest these disease subtypes represent asthma endotypes.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111DFQi4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms — Eosinophilic inflammation is commonly identified but varies across cohorts, with an eosinophil phenotype predicted in 72.5% in a primary care cohort while a noneosinophilic phenotype was 5.6%, whereas 47% in another cohort showed no evidence of persistent eosinophilic disease; airway inflammation in mild asthma is more likely to be T2, and interpretation must account for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) effects that can suppress T2 and overestimate non-T2 phenotypes; inflammatory phenotype may vary over time with increases after allergen exposure or during exacerbations and decreases with ICS therapy; even low-dose ICS attenuates early and late asthmatic responses and reduces eosinophilic response, and high-dose ICS improves airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) after 8 weeks of therapy.

### Asthma diagnosis: a comparison of established diagnostic guidelines in adults with respiratory symptoms [^114qc2CP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects around 300 million people worldwide, and in the UK 12% of the population have been diagnosed with the disease. Asthma is characterised by symptoms of wheeze, chest tightness, breathlessness and cough, typically associated with variable airflow obstruction and inflammation. There are however no gold standard diagnostic criteria for asthma, likely reflecting the heterogenous nature of the condition which encompasses different phenotypes (reflecting different underlying pathophysiology), particularly in adults. Given this phenotypic heterogeneity, it is inevitable that there are multiple pathways to an asthma diagnosis, incorporating different features measured with different tests.

Asthma misdiagnosis is common, reported by Aaron et al.in up to one third of subjects investigated within five years of initial diagnosis, more than half of whom had not undergone any objective testing at the time of diagnosis. Asthma symptoms are non-specific, so it is important to complete confirmatory diagnostic tests to minimise costs and risks associated with unnecessary treatment, and to offer the opportunity to make the correct diagnosis. These should be done prior to starting inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), as treatment can change results.

The most frequently used diagnostic pathways for asthma are produced by the European Respiratory Society (ERS; Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Asthma in Adults 2022), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management 2017)and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA; Global strategy for asthma management and prevention 2023). There were methodological differences in the development of the guidelines. However, these pathways show considerable variability in the utility of different tests, their thresholds, and the order in which they are conducted. None of these pathways has been tested prospectively in symptomatic adults not taking ICS.

The aim of this study was therefore to test the performance characteristics of the ERS, NICE, and GINA asthma diagnostic algorithms, in adults with symptoms in keeping with asthma but not on ICS, in the setting of our Rapid Access Diagnostics in Asthma research clinic (RADicA).

### A strategy for high-dimensional multivariable analysis classifies childhood asthma phenotypes from genetic, immunological, and environmental factors [^1133dbN1]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, we propose a novel approach to optimize prediction of childhood asthma phenotypes when different modalities are used as input factors. Prediction in the context of this paper refers to describing and distinguishing childhood asthma phenotypes in terms of classifying them into the corresponding clinical phenotype category rather than predicting the development of asthma. Our data include questionnaire, clinical diagnostic, genotype, expression microarray, quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR (RT‐qPCR), flow cytometry, and cytokine secretion data. Combining multilevel data types by a reliable analysis strategy for large human cohorts will contribute to detailed understanding of childhood asthma, potentially relevant for novel therapeutic strategies. The strategy can also be translated into numerous other complex diseases.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1161qxtH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — SCIT candidate selection and testing: Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children with allergic asthma when allergic sensitization can be demonstrated and a history shows a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, with testing that confirms sensitization. Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy when allergen exposure is a significant contributor, but clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm. Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when they or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden. In addition to history, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma, and clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype.

### Biomarkers for severe eosinophilic asthma [^117GVqHH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen the approval of several new biologics for the treatment of severe asthma-targeting specific endotypes and phenotypes. This review will examine how evidence generated from the mepolizumab clinical development program showed that blood eosinophil counts, rather than sputum or tissue eosinophil counts, evolved as a pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarker for the efficacy of treatment with mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Based on the available evidence and combined with clinical judgement, a baseline blood eosinophil threshold of 150 cells/μL or greater or a historical blood eosinophil threshold of 300 cells/μL or greater will allow selection of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are most likely to achieve clinically significant reductions in the rate of exacerbations with mepolizumab treatment.

### Features of asthma which provide meaningful insights for understanding the disease heterogeneity [^114wkPcC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

When selecting the variables for unsupervised analyses, the investigators rely on the data which are available (eg in birth cohorts 10, 20, 21 or studies of adults and children with established disease). 7, 8, 9 In most clinical studies, the assessment and monitoring of study participants focuses on measures which aim to ascertain asthma presence, severity, control, and responsiveness to treatment. We hypothesize that these may not necessarily be the variables or features which are most informative for the discovery of disease endotypes. We propose that a careful synergy of data‐driven methods and clinical interpretation may help us to better understand the heterogeneity of asthma and enable the discovery of true asthma endotypes. In this study, we aimed to ascertain whether a framework for data interrogation which utilizes an integrative approach that brings together the data and biostatistical expertise, with a clinical expert domain knowledge and clinical experience, can facilitate the identification of stable and clinically meaningful asthma subtypes.

### Validated and longitudinally stable asthma phenotypes based on cluster analysis of the ADEPT study [^116nqigB]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we have provided evidence for four phenotypes that are stable over time and are differentiated by both clinical severity, response to their prescribed treatment and the underlying T2 gene expression profile. Critically, these phenotypic groups were validated in an independent asthma cohort. Further extensive gene expression data and other 'omics' analyses remain available for more in-depth evaluation of molecular profiles associated with these newly defined clinical phenotypic groups. Focusing on the biology of each phenotype and understanding the unmet need will aid in developing tailored therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

Box 8–3 — assess and treat severe asthma phenotypes presents a Type 2 airway inflammation pathway in which Type 2 inflammation is indicated by blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb and/or sputum eosinophils ≥ 2%, and/or asthma is clinically allergen-driven, with a note to repeat blood eosinophils and FeNO up to 3x, at least 1–2 weeks after OCS or at lowest possible OCS dose. For patients with evidence of Type 2 airway inflammation, consider adherence tests, consider increasing the ICS dose for 3–6 months, and consider add-on non-biologic treatment for specific Type 2 clinical phenotypes. The algorithm asks, Is add-on Type 2 biologic therapy available/affordable?, and advises, Check local eligibility criteria for specific biologic therapies as these may vary from those listed. If add-on Type 2 targeted biologic therapy is NOT available/affordable, consider higher dose ICS, if not used, consider other add-on therapy (e.g. LAMA, LTRA, low dose azithromycin), as last resort, consider add-on low dose OCS, but implement strategies to minimize side-effects, and stop ineffective add-on therapies.

### Heterogeneity of response to asthma controller therapy: clinical implications [^116ABrQQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with asthma exhibit heterogeneous responses to all classes of asthma medication. This review examines clinical characteristics, biomarkers of inflammation, and genetic polymorphisms associated with treatment responsiveness in studies of adults and children with asthma, with an emphasis on inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers.

Recent Findings

Recent clinical studies extended previous observations of associations between biomarkers of allergic inflammation and responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, and between cigarette smoke exposure and responsiveness to montelukast. Pharmacogenetic studies revealed associations between treatment response and genetic variations in CRHR1, as well as a number of genes encoding proteins involved in the absorption, production, and action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Very few studies have attempted to test the ability of these phenotypic and genotypic associations to predict treatment responsiveness.

Summary

Additional prospective studies of sufficient size, quality, and ethnic diversity are needed to determine how best to incorporate information about genetic variations, clinical characteristics, and biomarkers into decisions about asthma therapy for individual patients.

### Type 2 or non-type 2 asthma exacerbations? That is the question [^116QhBwB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the study by McDowell and colleagues is a welcome effort to understand the nature of asthma exacerbations through the T2/non-T2 phenotypic lens, it unfortunately falls short in providing robust data to draw solid conclusions because of several limitations. The limited number of clinically assessed exacerbations introduces potential biases that limit the external validity of the study. Furthermore, the small number of sputum samples analyzed limits the ability to draw meaningful conclusions with regard to the role of the microbiome in exacerbation phenotype. Finally, the concurrent use of OCSs is an important confounder of the study, limiting the ability to fully elucidate the biological basis of the exacerbation phenotype. Although some of these limitations, as pointed out by the authors, are the result of conducting large multicenter asthma exacerbation studies, they do limit the generalizability of their findings.

As outlined by the Lancet Commission on asthma, it is critical to deconstruct airway disease into component parts before planning treatment, with a focus on traits that are identifiable and treatable. It is clear that this recommendation should also be applied to the evaluation and treatment of asthma exacerbations. McDowell and colleagues get us closer to this goal but with still lingering important questions, including how much of what we see in patients with exacerbations is truly underlying low T2 biology versus OCS-suppressed T2 inflammation. Additional investigation of asthma exacerbations that incorporates additional biological mechanisms, including a broader interrogation of the microbiome, would be beneficial to further understand the complex pathobiology of exacerbations.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^111W9fMx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Molecular Biomarkers and Phenotyping

T2 Phenotyping

Currently, after an asthma diagnosis is confirmed, the most informative clinical phenotyping is determination of T2 status (Figure 1B). Minimum blood eosinophil concentrations to identify T2-high (T2-Hi) CS-treated disease range from 150 to 300 eosinophils/μl, whereas minimum F NO concentrations range from 20 to 25 ppb. Although the relation of these cut points to lung eosinophils or T2 inflammation in severe asthma is less clear, treatment with IL-4 receptor–targeted antibodies is efficacious in patients meeting these cut points, supportive of active T2 immunity, even with lower T2 biomarkers. The prevalence of T2-Hi severe asthma is unclear, but nearly 65% of patients enrolled in a European study, U-BIOPRED (Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes), had elevated sputum eosinophils despite high-dose CSs. Accurate T2 phenotyping in patients on systemic CSs may require CS tapering and reevaluation with symptom onset/worsening (Figure 1B). Patients who repeatedly have no elevations in T2 biomarkers would be considered T2-low (T2-Lo).

Age at Onset

Although T2 phenotyping is well established and predictive of treatment responses, additional clinical features also may determine responses to therapy, including age at onset of symptoms (Figure 1B). Age at onset is consistently associated with differing clinical asthma characteristics, despite similar elevations in T2 biomarkers (,–). EOA (typically before ages of 13–18 yr) is consistently associated with allergic symptoms/specific IgE to environmental allergens. Despite elevated allergic biomarkers, T2 biomarker concentrations are variable. Like EOA, later-onset asthma (LOA) can be associated or not with T2 inflammation. However, unlike EOA, when T2 biomarkers are elevated, LOA T2-Hi asthma associates with even higher blood and lung eosinophil concentrations, more nasal polyps, and less specific IgE. Obesity may be seen across all groups, but a subgroup with LOA is associated with very low T2 and allergic/IgE biomarker concentrations. Molecular or even physiologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. These profound differences in EOA versus LOA with similar T2-biomarker variability suggest different underlying molecular mechanisms.

### Biomarkers in asthma, potential for therapeutic intervention [^114PbzX8]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by multiple phenotypes with varying risk factors and therapeutic responses. This Commentary describes research on biomarkers for T2-"high" and T2-"low" inflammation, a hallmark of the disease. Patients with asthma who exhibit an increase in airway T2 inflammation are classified as having T2-high asthma. In this endotype, Type 2 cytokines interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, plus other inflammatory mediators, lead to increased eosinophilic inflammation and elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). In contrast, T2-low asthma has no clear definition. Biomarkers are considered valuable tools as they can help identify various phenotypes and endotypes, as well as treatment response to standard treatment or potential therapeutic targets, particularly for biologics. As our knowledge of phenotypes and endotypes expands, biologics are increasingly integrated into treatment strategies for severe asthma. These treatments block specific inflammatory pathways or single mediators. While single or composite biomarkers may help to identify subsets of patients who might benefit from these treatments, only a few inflammatory biomarkers have been validated for clinical application. One example is sputum eosinophilia, a particularly useful biomarker, as it may suggest corticosteroid responsiveness or reflect non-compliance to inhaled corticosteroids. As knowledge develops, a meaningful goal would be to provide individualized care to patients with asthma.

### Asthma phenotypes in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort [^115mHmZF]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Identification of asthma phenotypes facilitates our understanding of asthma pathobiologies. Phenotypes observed in homogenous Asian cohorts have distinct differences from those described in Caucasian cohorts, suggesting that ethnicity may influence phenotypic expression. Phenotypic clusters in a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian cohort have not been described before, and direct comparisons of these clusters within a single study may reveal how ethnicity affects phenotypic expression.

Methods

Six hundred and thirty adult asthma patients from two healthcare institutions in Singapore were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to a test and validation cohort. Latent class analysis was performed on both cohorts using age of asthma onset, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index, lung function, blood eosinophil count, asthma control test score, and exacerbation frequency as input variables. Phenotypic clusters between the test and validation cohorts were compared RESULTS: Three clusters were identified in both the test and validation cohorts, with corresponding clusters of each cohort sharing similar characteristics. Ethnic representation and asthma control were significantly different between clusters. Cluster one comprised Chinese females with late-onset asthma and the best asthma control. Cluster two comprised non-Chinese females with obesity and the worst asthma control. Cluster three was multi-ethnic with the greatest proportion of atopic patients.

Conclusion

We identified three phenotypic clusters in our multi-ethnic Southeast Asian population, with distinct differences in ethnicity which may be attributable to inherent differences in baseline characteristics among ethnic groups.

### Phenotyping of difficult asthma using longitudinal physiological and biomarker measurements reveals significant differences in stability between clusters [^117FEmSQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Global prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with asthma have increased over the last 40 years. Despite improved treatments for asthma, updated recommendations for asthma care such as the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines (GINA), and various national clinical practice guidelines, lack of asthma control still remains a significant issue. Approximately 300 million people worldwide currently have asthma, and its prevalence increases by 50% every decade. In North America, 10% of the population has asthma and the prevalence of asthma in the United States is increasing. Heterogeneity of clinical presentation and disease mechanisms exist within asthma, frustrating attempts to achieve optimal asthma control in all subjects. Identification of asthma phenotypes, i.e.g.roups with unique characteristics that are stable or predictable over time, may have prognostic or therapeutic significance leading to better tailoring of subject-centered therapies.

Traditional classification and management approaches in asthma do not reflect the heterogeneous characteristics of this disease. Our study contains subjects who meet the American Thoracic Society definition of severe asthma, which supports clinical heterogeneity in asthma and the need for new approaches for the classification of disease severity in asthma. Use of clustering is quite popular in identifying clinical phenotypes of asthma.

Recent studies have identified different asthma phenotypes based on clinical features and pathophysiological mechanisms using cluster analysis. However, the stability of clusters over time has not been well addressed. Moore et al. proposed asthma phenotypes based on physiological variables and medical history, while, Hastie et al. identified phenotypes using biomarkers of inflammation neutrophil and eosinophil count in induced sputum. Kupczyk et al. found that 30 and 49% of severe asthmatics changed cluster allocation after a 1-year follow up using physiological and biomarker clustering, respectively. The authors concluded that physiological and biomarker measurements reflect different activities of asthma. Therefore we hypothesized that integration of physiological, clinical and biomarker data may provide a more comprehensive profile of each asthmatic and improve the stability of cluster allocation. We analyzed clusters at five time points (at 3-month intervals) over a 1-year span to more accurately assess stability of these clusters.

### Non-T2 asthma [^115qfKmf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the non-T asthma phenotypes. Asthma is an umbrella term that defines a complex group of heterogenous airway disorders, which are broadly categorized into predominantly T2 or non-T2 phenotypes depending on the presence and levels of airway and systemic biomarkers associated with a T2 inflammatory response. Individuals with predominant T2 asthma have greater numbers of peripheral blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide and IgE. These patients have more atopy and earlier onset asthma. In contrast, the absence or low levels of these biomarkers define non-T2 asthma. This is a heterogenous group with a later onset of asthma that is also more commonly associated with obesity and with females.

Recent Findings

This article summarizes new information regarding the plasticity that exists between T2 and non-T2 mechanisms, including their role in exacerbation-prone and nonexacerbating asthma, and many of the risk factors associated with the non-T2 phenotype, such as viral infections, ambient air pollution exposure, smoking, genetic and metabolic factors. It also provides new information on the immunological and metabolic mechanisms associated with non-T2 asthma. We also discuss how to manage this asthma phenotype and how treatment responses differ for these patients.

Summary

Non-T2 asthma defines a heterogenous group of asthma phenotypes. However, acknowledging that the absence of T2 biomarkers is influenced by several factors is important and can longitudinally change in relation to exacerbations, particularly in children.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111hwuDH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of mild asthma — Mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms are framed across "airway responsiveness, pathophysiology, inflammatory phenotype, exacerbation pattern, and longitudinal clinical symptom burden", with "heterogeneity in inflammation" linked to epithelial triggers and exposures. In post hoc analyses from the Severe Asthma Research Program, "the mild asthma cohort was more likely to have early-onset asthma (age < 12 yr), was predominantly female, and exhibited some atopy", and "were on no or low-to moderate-dose ICSs and had low healthcare resource use". Quantitatively, "In SARP III, 40% of patients with early-onset asthma had elevated blood eosinophils, 20% had elevated sputum eosinophils, and 60% had elevated sputum neutrophils (highest cell count noted on repeat measures)", while in SIENA "only ∼25% of patients had elevated sputum eosinophils".

### Biomarker-guided withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients with a non-T2 inflammatory phenotype-a randomized controlled trial protocol [^116RW1df]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several biomarkers have shown some association to the T2 phenotype, including high FeNO, positive mannitol provocation test, and high sputum-eosinophils. However, FeNO is not 100% specific for eosinophilic inflammation and the sensitivity is poor, so this test cannot stand alone. The other available tests have practical and clinical challenges, so easily applicable biomarkers for phenotyping asthma are needed.

High values of serum-periostin are associated with T2 asthma. Periostin is a matricellular protein secreted by bronchial epithelial cells when exposed to IL-13 and IL-4. This biomarker plays a role in several pathogenic processes in asthma, including airway remodeling, subepithelial fibrosis, eosinophil recruitment and regulation of mucus production in goblet cells. Thus, serum-periostin may be a potential easily accessible biomarker to guide ICS-treatment. The evidence in this area is very sparse. However, a recent study of severe asthmatics did compare a composite biomarker-guided vs. symptom-guided treatment with ICS. The composite biomarkers included serum-periostin, FeNO and blood eosinophils. The biomarker-guided algorithm successfully reduced the ICS dose when compared to the symptom-guided regimen in a per-protocol population. The patients who reduced ICS dose did not experience loss of symptom control or change in biomarkers.

In the future management of asthma, there is a need to fully acknowledge the heterogeneity of the disease and turn towards more targeted and individualized treatments and away from a 'one-size fits all' strategy. Therefore, a clinically applicable method to determine the group of patients with low ICS efficacy is needed. In this study we build upon knowledge from currently available studies and apply a panel of biomarkers to phenotype asthma patients, thus identifying patients who do not express T2 inflammation. The aim of this RCT is to determine whether it is possible to withdraw ICS in this subgroup of patients without loss of symptom control. In order to test the non-inferiority of this phenotype-based treatment strategy, it is compared to standard care.

### Type 2 or non-type 2 asthma exacerbations? That is the question [^114yfGrW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although we have made considerable progress in understanding the risk factors associated with asthma exacerbations and to a certain extent have developed effective therapeutic strategies to prevent them, they continue to be a leading cause of morbidity resulting in excess healthcare use and increased healthcare expenditures. Moreover, there have been limited scientific advancements regarding therapeutic strategies for the treatment of asthma exacerbations over the past decade. Unlike the use of newer biological therapies that rely on determining the underlying inflammatory endotype, a similar decision algorithm to treat acute exacerbations is lacking. Understanding how different inflammatory asthma phenotypes exacerbate is critical to the development of new therapeutic strategies for asthma exacerbations and to limit exposure to harmful or ineffective therapies.

In a study published in this issue of the Journal, McDowell and colleagues (pp.) used data from the Refractory Asthma Stratification Program to better understand the association between asthma exacerbation rates and the underlying inflammatory asthma phenotype (T2 biomarker–low [T2 LOW] vs. T2 HIGH). This was a 48-week, multicenter study of adult participants meeting Global Initiative for Asthma asthma severity steps 4 and 5 criteria, who were randomized either to a treatment algorithm led by composite type 2 biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [F NO], blood eosinophils, and serum periostin) or to a symptom/risk-based algorithm to optimize the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. To enrich for a T2 LOW population within the cohort, participants were enrolled only if they had an F NO < 45 ppb at the screening visit. The inflammatory phenotype was determined at the baseline visit and at the time of each exacerbation and was defined as being either T2 LOW if the F NO was ≤ 20 ppb and peripheral blood eosinophils were ≤ 0.15 × 10⁹/L or T2 HIGH if these values were above this cutoff. Exacerbations were protocol defined as "severe asthma symptoms worsening outside of a patient's normal daily variation". The study population, which included 301 participants, was mostly middle aged; predominantly female; and, on average, obese. There were 390 exacerbation events during follow-up with 60.8% (183 of 301) experiencing one or more exacerbations. Compared with those without exacerbations, those who did have exacerbations had a higher body mass index, were more likely to be female, and more likely to have received oral corticosteroids (OCSs) in the past. Interestingly, > 70% of participants were T2 HIGH at baseline, in spite of the fact that the study design attempted to enrich for a T2 LOW population. Those in the T2 HIGH group had worse airway obstruction and, as expected, a greater preponderance of T2 biomarkers and nasal polyps. In contrast, the T2 LOW participants were more likely to have a prior ICU or hospital admission for asthma. Nearly half of this population was receiving maintenance OCSs (vs. only one-third of the T2 HIGH participants), which could have reduced the eosinophil blood counts and bias toward a more severe group.

### Exacerbation profile and risk factors in a type-2-low enriched severe asthma cohort: a clinical trial to assess asthma exacerbation phenotypes [^114fFzuW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The past 25 years have seen huge progress in understanding of the pathobiology of type-2 (T2) asthma, identification of measurable biomarkers, and the emergence of novel monoclonal antibody treatments. Although present in a minority of patients with severe asthma, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying T2-low asthma, making it a significant unmet need in asthma research. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore the differences between study exacerbators and nonexacerbators, to describe physiological changes at exacerbation in those who are T2 HIGH and T2 LOW at the time of exacerbation, and to evaluate the stability of inflammatory phenotypes when stable and at exacerbation. Methods: Exacerbation assessment was a prespecified secondary analysis of data from a 48-week, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study comparing the use of biomarkers and symptoms to adjust steroid treatment in a T2-low severe asthma-enriched cohort. Participants were phenotyped as T2 LOW (fractional exhaled nitric oxide ≤ 20 ppb and blood eosinophil count ≤ 150 cells/µl) or T2 HIGH (fractional exhaled nitric oxide > 20 or blood eosinophil count > 150) at study enrollment and at each exacerbation. Here, we report the findings of the exacerbation analyses, including comparison of exacerbators and nonexacerbators, the physiological changes at exacerbation in those who had evidence of T2 biology at exacerbation versus those that did not, and the stability of inflammatory phenotypes when stable and at exacerbation. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 301 participants, 60.8% (183) had one or more self-reported exacerbations (total of 390). Exacerbators were more likely to be female, have a higher body mass index, and have more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid and unscheduled primary care attendances for exacerbations. At enrollment, 23.6% (71) were T2 LOW and 76.4% (230) T2 HIGH. The T2 LOW group had more asthma primary care attendances, were more likely to have a previous admission to HDU (high dependency unit)/ICU and to be receiving maintenance oral corticosteroids. At exacerbation, the T2 LOW events were indistinguishable from T2 HIGH exacerbations in terms of lung function (mean fall in T2 LOW FEV 1, 200 [400] mL vs. T2 HIGH 200 [300] ml; P = 0.93) and symptom increase (ACQ5: T2 LOW, 1.4 [0.8] vs. T2 HIGH, 1.3 [0.8]; P = 0.72), with no increase in T2 biomarkers from stable to exacerbation state in the T2 LOW exacerbations. The inflammatory phenotype within individual patients was dynamic; inflammatory phenotype at study entry did not have a significant association with exacerbation phenotype. Conclusions: Asthma exacerbations demonstrating a T2 LOW phenotype were physiologically and symptomatically similar to T2 HIGH exacerbations. T2 LOW asthma was an unstable phenotype, suggesting that exacerbation phenotyping should occur at the time of exacerbation. The clinically significant exacerbations in participants without evidence of T2 biology at the time of exacerbation highlight the unmet and pressing need to further understand the mechanisms at play in non-T2 asthma. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02717689).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of therapy responses in allergic diseases and asthma [^113PLXYv]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

2 BIOMARKERS IN ASTHMA

In the past decades, it has been increasingly recognized that asthma is a highly heterogeneous disorder with different underlying mechanisms and pathways translating into variable responses to standard treatment across the different subsets or clinical phenotypes. 23, 24 Unbiased approaches and cluster analyses identified four major clinical phenotypes: (a) early‐onset allergic asthma, (b) early‐onset allergic moderate‐to‐severe asthma, (c) late‐onset nonallergic eosinophilic asthma and (d) late‐onset nonallergic noneosinophilic asthma. 25 The late‐onset subsets tend to present as more severe or more difficult to treat than early‐onset asthma. To promote an adequate treatment strategy, asthma can be subdivided into Type 2 (high) and non‐Type 2 (or Type 2 low) endotypes based on their underlying inflammatory pathways. 26 As part of a more general syndrome often including nasal polyps with or without NSAID‐Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (NERD), 27, 28 Type 2 asthma currently comprises the best defined asthma subset(s) in terms of underlying immunopathology, corresponding biomarkers 8 and targeted treatment options with biologicals and small molecules. 13, 29, 30

### Molecular endotypes contribute to the heterogeneity of asthma [^111t7TXk]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of asthma is commonly implemented based on clinical assessment. Although these nonmolecular biomarkers have been useful, limited resolution of the heterogeneity among asthmatic patients and little information regarding the underlying pathobiology of disease in individuals have been provided. Molecular endotying using global transcriptome expression profiling associated with clinical features of asthma has improved our understanding of disease mechanisms, risk assessment of asthma exacerbations, and treatment responses, especially in patients with type 2 inflammation. Further advances in establishing pathobiological subgroups, bioactive pathways, and true disease endotypes hold potential for a more personalized medical approach in asthmatic patients.

### Disaggregating asthma: big investigation versus big data [^113BTDSK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

One area that has been relatively more successful is the identification of biomarkersfor more targeted treatment strategies. A recent review Berry and Busseidentified 4 main biomarkers that might help optimize treatment strategies for different asthma phenotypes. These biomarkers are generally limited to T2 mechanisms: eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, periostin, and IgE. However, biomarker assessment has not as yet become an integral part of clinical practice, nor is it reflected in current asthma guidelines. Validation steps are necessary, and acknowledgement in asthma guidelines would prompt application of such information in clinical practice. The identification of non-T2 biomarkers is an important area of research that needs to be exploitedwith biomarker identification for asthma and allergic diseases still in its embryonic stages. Furthermore, although biomarker identification has indeed led to more targeted asthma treatment strategies, there are currently no biomarkers that reflect the underlying causal mechanisms, which could predict disease onset or progression.

Although phenotypic heterogeneity of asthma is now widely accepted, we are still scratching the surface of identifying the different endotypes of asthma and understanding their unique underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, which is a prerequisite for precision medicine. Although there is general consensus that there are different asthma endotypes and different phenotypes of wheezing during childhood, there is no consensus on how best to define them. A more refined endotypic definition of asthma and allergic diseases can drive more targeted research to identify distinct molecular, genetic, environmental, and demographic characteristics that might allow us to predict causality of distinct endotypes with greater accuracy.

One approach used in a number of studies has been to investigate temporal patterns of symptoms over time. The common labels across most studies have been transient early wheeze, late-onset wheeze, and persistent wheeze. However, different studies reported different numbers of childhood wheeze phenotypes (eg, ranging between 2 and 6). One of the challenges in current research aimed at defining subgroups of patients based on the natural history of wheezing is the lack of consistency in definition of these phenotypes and what they represent. The inconsistency in defining wheeze phenotypes based on longitudinal profiles of symptoms over time across different studies might merely reflect inconsistencies in the nature and timing of questions used (eg, physician-confirmed wheezing, vs parentally reported wheezing). Thus although the definition of subtypes based on profiles of symptoms over time is better than that based on a single time point, variability in input variables has an effect on the accuracy of defining subtypes and identifying predictive models.

### Overlap of atopic, eosinophilic, and TH2-high asthma phenotypes in a general population with current asthma [^115H3tPn]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic, eosinophilic, and TH2-high asthma phenotypes may overlap, but the extent is unknown. Understanding the overlap across these phenotypes may be useful in guiding asthma patient care.

Objective

To examine the frequency and overlap of atopic, eosinophilic, and TH2-high asthma phenotypes.

Methods

We analyzed 2005 to 2006 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Patients with asthma were identified based on the participant self-report. Eosinophilic asthma was defined as a blood eosinophil cutoff point of ≥ 150, 300, or 400/μL. Atopic asthma was defined as having an allergen-specific IgE level of ≥ 0.35 IU/mL for any of the 9 perennial allergens tested. TH2-high asthma was defined as a total serum IgE of ≥ 100 IU/mL and a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 140/μL.

Results

The study included 269 children and 310 adults. Depending on the eosinophil cutoff used, 31% to 78% of children and 21% to 69% of adults with asthma were classified as having eosinophilic asthma. In addition, 63% of children and 61% of adults were classified as having atopic disease and 48% of children and 37% of adults as having TH2-high asthma. At a higher eosinophil cutoff point, a greater proportion of eosinophilic asthma can be classified as atopic or TH2 high, but a lower proportion of atopic or TH2-high asthma can be classified as eosinophilic. Approximately 70% or more of children and adults with asthma were 1 of these 3 phenotypes.

Conclusion

A considerable overlap among eosinophilic, atopic, and TH2-high asthma phenotypes exists in a general asthma population.

### Is it possible to claim or refute sputum eosinophils ≥ 3% in asthmatics with sufficient accuracy using biomarkers? [^113XmHc2]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

The concept of asthma inflammatory phenotypes has proved to be important in predicting response to inhaled corticosteroids. Induced sputum, which has been pivotal in the development of the concept of inflammatory phenotypes, is however not widely available. Several studies have proposed to use surrogate exhaled or blood biomarkers, like fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), blood eosinophils and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). However, taken alone, each of these biomarkers has moderate accuracy to identify sputum eosinophilia. Here, we propose a new approach based on the likelihood ratio to study which thresholds of these biomarkers, taken alone or in combination, were able to rule in or rule out sputum eosinophils ≥ 3%. We showed in a large population of 869 asthmatics that combining FENO, blood eosinophils and total serum IgE could accurately predict sputum eosinophils ≥ or < 3% in 58% of our population.
