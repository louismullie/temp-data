## Question

Hipoxia neonatal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about neonatal hypoxia, including definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and scope to avoid conflating neonatal encephalopathy with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Then, I should verify epidemiology and global burden. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and the evolving brain injury cascade. After that, I need to check diagnostic criteria, staging, and the differential diagnosis. Then, I will review evidence-based management, including resuscitation, oxygenation, therapeutic hypothermia, and adjuncts. I should also consider special populations like preterm infants and LMIC settings. Finally, I will synthesize prognosis and identify knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations and that I correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. Neonatal encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome of disturbed neurological function in the newborn, whereas hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a specific subset of NE attributable to perinatal hypoxia-ischemia; I should not use HIE unless there is evidence of an intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic event, and I need to remember that NE has many non-asphyxial etiologies including infection, stroke, metabolic, and genetic causes [^11545kmg] [^114cKszY] [^1144amYh].

> I should double-check the epidemiology before drawing conclusions. In high-resource settings, HIE occurs in roughly 1–3 per 1,000 live births, whereas in LMICs the burden is substantially higher, with estimates up to 20 per 1,000; globally, intrapartum-related NE accounts for approximately 1.15 million cases annually, with about 287,000 neonatal deaths and 233,000 moderate-to-severe disabilities, the vast majority in LMICs, underscoring a major preventable burden [^113dgxQd] [^1123x6Xa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation in preterm infants. I initially thought hypoxia-ischemia was a leading cause of preterm brain injury, but wait, I should verify that; several reviews argue that hypoxia-ischemia is not the primary antecedent of most preterm brain damage, and that encephalopathy of prematurity reflects multifactorial vulnerability including inflammation, maturational factors, and oxidative stress rather than isolated hypoxia, so I need to be cautious in attributing preterm injury solely to hypoxia-ischemia [^113mRXF3] [^111pvXYD] [^116x2cyS].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology in term infants to anchor management. The injury evolves through primary energy failure from hypoxia-ischemia, followed by a latent phase and then secondary energy failure with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation; therapeutic hypothermia works by slowing these cascades, reducing metabolic demand, and mitigating secondary injury, which explains the time-sensitive window for intervention [^115T5ukW] [^114Tz2PB].

> I need to ensure diagnostic criteria are applied rigorously. Clinically, HIE is supported by a history of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, abnormal Apgar scores, and metabolic acidosis on cord or early blood gases, alongside encephalopathy on exam; the Sarnat staging system remains useful for severity stratification, and I should confirm exclusion of other causes before labeling HIE, using EEG/aEEG and MRI to characterize injury and guide prognosis [^112bXPxo] [^114xk1z3] [^116FKKVg].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully so I don't miss mimics. Infection such as sepsis or meningitis, neonatal stroke, metabolic and genetic disorders, and congenital anomalies can all present as NE; I should check maternal history, placental pathology, and targeted labs and imaging to distinguish these entities, because misclassification can delay appropriate therapy and misinform prognosis [^11545kmg] [^1144amYh] [^115Lz1SD].

> Now, I will examine immediate stabilization and resuscitation, and I should confirm oxygen targets. For term and late-preterm infants, start with room air and titrate to age-appropriate SpO2 targets using pulse oximetry on the right hand; by 5 minutes, target 80–85%, rising to 85–90% by 10 minutes, while avoiding both hypoxia and hyperoxia to limit oxidative injury and cerebral vasoconstriction; for very preterm infants, starting FiO2 around 0.3–1.0 with rapid titration may mitigate early hypoxia and bradycardia, but I need to balance this against hyperoxia risks [^116ACYwk] [^115aE4cp] [^112bBJCf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of therapeutic hypothermia because timing is critical. Therapeutic hypothermia at 33–34°C for 72 hours initiated within 6 hours of birth reduces death or major neurodevelopmental disability in moderate-to-severe HIE, with a number needed to treat around 7; I should confirm candidacy promptly and avoid delays, and I must remember that deeper or longer cooling has not shown benefit and may worsen outcomes, so adherence to established protocols is essential [^113Pa8hj] [^1121ZSmy] [^1138JnWf].

> I should review adjunctive therapies and be honest about evidence gaps. Inhaled nitric oxide is indicated for term or near-term infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure, with a rapid assessment of response and discontinuation if no improvement; surfactant is appropriate for secondary surfactant deficiency states such as meconium aspiration or pneumonia; seizures should be treated with anticonvulsants, typically phenobarbital first-line; and emerging neuroprotective agents like erythropoietin, melatonin, or xenon are under investigation but are not yet standard of care [^117BUtRn] [^116MWs3p] [^1149M5Ge].

> But wait, what about preterm infants and oxygen targeting; I need to check the balance of harms. Lower SpO2 targets reduce severe ROP but increase mortality and NEC, whereas higher targets increase ROP; the NeOProM meta-analysis showed no difference in the composite of death or major disability between lower and higher ranges, but mortality was higher with lower targets, so I should individualize within NICU-specific policies and staffing contexts and avoid both prolonged hypoxemia and hyperoxemia [^112AXAX1].

> Next, I should review multi-organ involvement and hemodynamic support. HIE is a multi-system disease with frequent cardiac, renal, and hepatic injury even in mild cases; targeted neonatal echocardiography helps detect myocardial dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and shunting, and I should monitor for RV dysfunction and systemic perfusion to guide vasoactive support and fluid management during cooling and rewarming [^117K2ZAJ] [^112z5JVD] [^117TyGmU].

> I will now examine prognostication so counseling is accurate. Early clinical examination, EEG/aEEG, and MRI patterns within the first week predict outcomes; diffusion-weighted imaging detects injury earlier but may underestimate chronic injury, so serial imaging and standardized neurodevelopmental follow-up are crucial; even mild HIE carries measurable risks of abnormal MRI and later impairment, so I should avoid over-reassurance in this group [^117SRqiN] [^111QRc1Q] [^117DqXQZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the LMIC context because practice and outcomes differ. Many infants with HIE in LMICs do not receive timely cooling due to access and infrastructure barriers, and a large multicenter South Asian trial suggested no benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in that setting, highlighting the need for context-specific neuroprotective strategies and systems strengthening; nonetheless, global data indicate that many neonatal hypoxia deaths are preventable with improved peripartum care and resuscitation quality [^115V7CjK] [^1123x6Xa] [^112AfJa6].

> Let me reconsider oxygen as a medication to ensure dosing discipline. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia cause harm in neonates, with hyperoxia linked to cerebral vasoconstriction, oxidative injury, and worse neurodevelopmental outcomes in some models; therefore, I should treat oxygen like any drug with clear indications, targets, and weaning plans, and avoid prophylactic high FiO2 when not indicated [^113k8MyK] [^112NLNTD] [^111nppwQ].

> Finally, I should identify knowledge gaps and future directions. We need better early biomarkers and predictive models to individualize therapy, refined oxygen targeting strategies across gestational ages, and effective adjuncts to hypothermia; precision medicine approaches incorporating genetic susceptibility may help identify infants at highest risk and tailor interventions, and long-term follow-up to school age is essential to capture subtle cognitive and executive deficits that emerge over time [^111zn19W] [^1149M5Ge] [^116ztxTX].

Neonatal hypoxia is a **critical condition** characterized by insufficient oxygen supply to the newborn, most often due to perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress, or congenital heart disease. It can cause **multi-organ injury**, with the brain most severely affected, leading to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment [^116AEAA6]. Immediate management includes **stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation** [^112bBJCf], initiating **therapeutic hypothermia within 6 hours** for moderate-to-severe HIE [^113Pa8hj], and providing supportive care [^116AEAA6]. Early recognition and intervention are essential to reduce mortality and disability [^113Pa8hj]; even with hypothermia, about 40% of affected infants have adverse outcomes, underscoring the need for ongoing research and adjunctive therapies [^115V7CjK].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Neonatal hypoxia arises from diverse causes; **perinatal asphyxia** — due to placental abruption, cord prolapse, or maternal hypotension — is the most common [^112bXPxo]. Other causes include **respiratory distress syndrome**, meconium aspiration, pneumonia, congenital heart disease, and maternal conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and infections [^114D3FtC] [^112bXPxo]. Risk factors include prematurity, low birth weight, maternal anemia, and limited access to prenatal care [^111th46r].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hypoxia triggers a cascade of cellular injury: primary energy failure from ATP depletion, followed by secondary injury from glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation [^115T5ukW]. The brain is especially vulnerable, leading to **HIE** with potential cerebral palsy, seizures, and cognitive impairment [^116AEAA6]. Multi-organ dysfunction is common, affecting the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs [^117K2ZAJ].

---

## Clinical presentation

Neonatal hypoxia presents with:

- **Respiratory distress**: tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, retractions, cyanosis [^11197QrV].
- **Neurological impairment**: lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, poor feeding, altered consciousness [^11545kmg].
- **Multi-organ dysfunction**: cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, hepatic injury, gastrointestinal complications [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging:

- **Clinical assessment**: Apgar scores, neurological examination, and Sarnat staging for HIE severity [^112bXPxo].
- **Laboratory tests**: arterial blood gases (pH, base deficit, lactate), electrolytes, glucose, and liver and renal function tests [^112bXPxo].
- **Imaging**: cranial ultrasound, MRI, and CT to assess brain injury and exclude other causes [^112cxdSP].
- **EEG**: to detect seizures and assess brain function [^116FKKVg].

---

## Management strategies

### Immediate stabilization

Immediate stabilization focuses on **airway and breathing** — establishing an airway and providing positive-pressure ventilation with room air or supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 at 85–95% [^116ACYwk] — and on **circulation** with chest compressions and epinephrine as indicated [^112bBJCf].

---

### Therapeutic hypothermia

Therapeutic hypothermia is the **standard of care** for moderate-to-severe HIE, initiated within 6 hours of birth, maintained at 33–34°C for 72 hours, and then gradually rewarmed [^113Pa8hj]. It reduces mortality and neurodevelopmental disability, with a number needed to treat of 7 [^113Pa8hj].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **mechanical ventilation** for respiratory failure, vasoactive drugs for hemodynamic stability, anticonvulsants for seizures, and meticulous fluid and electrolyte management [^1121ZSmy].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on severity, timing, and treatment; **mortality** is 10–20% in moderate-to-severe HIE, and survivors face high risks of cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, seizures, and visual or hearing loss [^notfound]. Even with hypothermia, about 40% have adverse outcomes, highlighting the need for adjunctive therapies [^115V7CjK].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **prenatal care** — monitoring maternal health, detecting high-risk pregnancies, and managing complications — and on **improved intrapartum care** with skilled attendance, fetal monitoring, and timely interventions [^112AfJa6]. Neonatal resuscitation training and access to NICU care further reduce hypoxia-related morbidity and mortality [^113Pa8hj].

---

Neonatal hypoxia is a **major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality**, with significant long-term consequences. Early recognition, rapid stabilization, and therapeutic hypothermia are critical to improving outcomes, but ongoing research is needed to optimize care and reduce the burden of disease [^1123x6Xa].

### Oxygen therapy in the neonatal care environment [^116uvBK9]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

The use of oxygen in the treatment of neonates with respiratory distress has been reported for more than a century. Oxygen therapy is generally titrated to one or more measures of blood oxygenation and administered to reverse or prevent hypoxia. Individual responses to oxygen therapy vary greatly, depending on the particular cause of hypoxia and the degree of impairment. Despite this focused purpose, oxygen administration in this patient population has become complex. The longer we deliver this drug, the more we discover its beneficial and detrimental effects. New and innovative ways to deliver and monitor this therapy have improved outcomes. Despite this vast experience there still remain some unanswered questions regarding the use of oxygen in the neonatal environment. Nonetheless, oxygen is a major staple in our treatment arsenal for neonates.

### Neonatal encephalopathy: beyond hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^11545kmg]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome of neurologic dysfunction that encompasses a broad spectrum of symptoms and severity, from mild irritability and feeding difficulties to coma and seizures. It is vital for providers to understand that the term "neonatal encephalopathy" is simply a description of the neonate's neurologic status that is agnostic to the underlying etiology. Unfortunately, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) has become common vernacular to describe any neonate with encephalopathy, but this can be misleading. The term should not be used unless there is evidence of perinatal asphyxia as the primary cause of encephalopathy. HIE is a common cause of neonatal encephalopathy; the differential diagnosis also includes conditions with infectious, vascular, epileptic, genetic/congenital, metabolic, and toxic causes. Because neonatal encephalopathy is estimated to affect 2 to 6 per 1,000 term births, of which HIE accounts for approximately 1.5 per 1,000 term births, (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) neonatologists and child neurologists should familiarize themselves with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the diverse causes of neonatal encephalopathy. This review begins by discussing HIE, but also helps practitioners extend the differential to consider the broad array of other causes of neonatal encephalopathy, emphasizing the epidemiology, neurologic presentations, diagnostics, imaging findings, and therapeutic strategies for each potential category.

### Advances in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^112khpzW]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the leading cause of neonatal encephalopathy in term or near-term neonates. Despite advances in perinatal care, HIE remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. Survivors of HIE are at high risk for lifelong neurodevelopmental impairments, which imposes substantial social and economic burdens on families and health care systems. This article provides a clinically-focused overview of HIE in term neonates, highlighting key investigations, management strategies, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and areas in need of further study.

### Towards standardized and clinically relevant definitions of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia in preterm infants: a systematic review [^111JrBDq]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonatal care, maintaining oxygen levels in the target range is essential to minimize adverse outcomes. Both episodes of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Criteria to determine the hypoxemic and hyperoxemic burden are currently not standardized or generally applied in clinical care. This results in difficulty to identify clinically relevant events in preterm infants. Clinical decisions and interventions are therefore mostly based on the experience of the clinical team. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the used definitions for hypoxemia and hyperoxemia in preterm infants, based on continuous monitoring techniques and the relation to neonatal outcome (PROSPERO: CRD42023493201).

### Imaging findings in neonatal hypoxia: a practical review [^112cxdSP]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The findings of hypoxia in the term neonate are unique; neonatal brain imaging findings differ from those of older children. Evaluation of neonatal brain images for signs of hypoxic injury requires attention to a specific set of signs.

Conclusion

Imaging findings in term neonates must be assessed according to different rules from those used in other age groups. Four major signs are proposed as a means of facilitating the diagnosis of hypoxia in the neonate.

### Management and investigation of neonatal encephalopathy: 2017 update [^1138JnWf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

This review discusses an approach to determining the cause of neonatal encephalopathy, as well as current evidence on resuscitation and subsequent management of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Encephalopathy in neonates can be due to varied aetiologies in addition to hypoxic-ischaemia. A combination of careful history, examination and the judicious use of investigations can help determine the cause. Over the last 7 years, infants with moderate to severe HIE have benefited from the introduction of routine therapeutic hypothermia; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome is 7 (95% CI 5 to 10). More recent research has focused on optimal resuscitation practices for babies with cardiorespiratory depression, such as delayed cord clamping after establishment of ventilation and resuscitation in air. Around a quarter of infants with asystole at 10 min after birth who are subsequently cooled have normal outcomes, suggesting that individualised decision making on stopping resuscitation is needed, based on access to intensive treatment unit and early cooling. The full benefit of cooling appears to have been exploited in our current treatment protocols of 72 hours at 33.5°C; deeper and longer cooling showed adverse outcome. The challenge over the next 5–10 years will be to assess which adjunct therapies are safe and optimise hypothermic brain protection in phase I and phase II trials. Optimal care may require tailoring treatments according to gender, genetic risk, injury severity and inflammatory status.

### Current management of the infant who presents with neonatal encephalopathy [^117AiTEd]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy after perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult is a major contributor to global child mortality and morbidity. Brain injury in term infants in response to hypoxic-ischemic insult is a complex process evolving over hours to days, which provides a unique window of opportunity for neuroprotective treatment interventions. Advances in neuroimaging, brain monitoring techniques, and tissue biomarkers have improved the ability to diagnose, monitor, and care for newborn infants with neonatal encephalopathy as well as predict their outcome. However, challenges remain in early identification of infants at risk for neonatal encephalopathy, determination of timing and extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, as well as optimal management and treatment duration. Therapeutic hypothermia is the most promising neuroprotective intervention to date for infants with moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy after perinatal asphyxia and has currently been incorporated in many neonatal intensive care units in developed countries. However, only 1 in 6 babies with encephalopathy will benefit from hypothermia therapy; many infants still develop significant adverse outcomes. To enhance the outcome, specific diagnostic predictors are needed to identify patients likely to benefit from hypothermia treatment. Studies are needed to determine the efficacy of combined therapeutic strategies with hypothermia therapy to achieve maximal neuroprotective effect. This review focuses on important concepts in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of infants with neonatal encephalopathy due to perinatal asphyxia, including an overview of recently introduced novel therapies.

### Intermittent hypoxic episodes in preterm infants: do they matter? [^111th46r]. Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Intermittent hypoxic episodes are typically a consequence of immature respiratory control and remain a troublesome challenge for the neonatologist. Furthermore, their frequency and magnitude are underestimated by clinically employed pulse oximeter settings. In extremely low birth weight infants the incidence of intermittent hypoxia progressively increases over the first 4 weeks of postnatal life, with a subsequent plateau followed by a slow decline beginning at weeks 6–8. Such episodic hypoxia/reoxygenation has the potential to sustain a proinflammatory cascade with resultant multisystem morbidity. This morbidity includes retinopathy of prematurity and impaired growth, as well as possible longer-term cardiorespiratory instability and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Therapeutic approaches for intermittent hypoxic episodes comprise determination of optimal baseline saturation and careful titration of supplemental inspired oxygen, as well as xanthine therapy to prevent apnea of prematurity. In conclusion, characterization of the pathophysiologic basis for such intermittent hypoxic episodes and their consequences during early life is necessary to provide an evidence-based approach to their management.

### Update on the current management of newborns with neonatal encephalopathy [^117SRqiN]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a subtype of neonatal encephalopathy and a major contributor to global neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in obstetric and neonatal care there are still challenges in accurate determination of etiology of neonatal encephalopathy. Thus, identification of intrapartum risk factors and comprehensive evaluation of the neonate is important to determine the etiology and severity of neonatal encephalopathy. In developed countries, therapeutic hypothermia as a standard of care therapy for neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has proven to decrease incidence of death and neurodevelopmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy in surviving children. Advances in neuroimaging, brain monitoring modalities, and biomarkers of brain injury have improved the ability to diagnose, monitor, and treat newborns with encephalopathy. However, challenges remain in early identification of neonates at risk for hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and determination of the timing and extent of brain injury. Using imaging studies such as Neonatal MRI and MR spectroscopy have proven to be most useful in predicting outcomes in infants with encephalopathy within the first week of life, although comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessments still remains the gold standard for determining long term outcomes. Future studies are needed to identify other newborns with encephalopathy that might benefit from therapeutic hypothermia and to determine the efficacy of other adjunctive neuroprotective strategies. This review focuses on newer evidence and advances in diagnoses and management of infants with neonatal encephalopathy, including novel therapies, as well as prognostication of outcomes to childhood.

### Neurological symptoms and cause of death among young children in low-and middle-income countries [^112AfJa6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

In this study, the leading cause of death in the neonatal period was neonatal hypoxia. A notable number of these deaths occurred despite the mothers giving birth in health facilities. Cesarean delivery, which can reduce the consequences of hypoxic events, was infrequently performed. These deaths were largely considered preventable with enhancements in perinatal clinical management and the quality of care provided.

Regarding meningitis deaths, premortem LPs were performed in less than one-tenth of patients who met the criteria. It is noteworthy that most LPs were conducted in South Africa. Consequently, in 6 of 7 settings, children who died from meningitis were rarely tested before death, indicating that management heavily relied on clinical suspicion and empirical treatment. In fact, Ethiopia, the site with the lowest number of participants enrolled at the time of the analysis, also had the highest proportion of deaths attributed to meningitis (28 of 68 [41.2%]), but no LPs were performed before death. These findings are likely attributable to multiple factors, including the following: lack of resources to perform an LP; lack of capacity to test CSF in most of the hospitals from our sites; hesitancy of practitioners and families toward the procedure, especially among patients with very severe illness; and lack of clear guidelines including LPs in the routine diagnostic pathway. This problem is particularly concerning among neonates: only 1 in 7 neonates presenting with seizures had an LP performed despite clear WHO guidelines recommending its use. Furthermore, an LP was performed in only 1 neonate with fever without neurological signs; tools commonly used in high-income countries to rule out potentially severe infections among neonates (eg, blood testing for C-reactive protein or procalcitonin) and therefore avoid LPs are rarely available in LMICs. Neonates were the age group in which most neurological diagnoses were confirmed postmortem, while they were the less symptomatic. Given the extremely complicated task of making a differential diagnosis among neonates based solely on unspecific clinical presentations, it is particularly worrying that the laboratory-based examinations needed to provide a correct diagnosis were seldom available and performed. Despite efforts to increase the performance of an LP in LICs, the CHAMPS data revealed extremely low compliance with LP implementation in clinical practice in these settings.

Malaria testing before death was not performed for more than one-third of patients with neurological symptoms attributed to cerebral malaria, and antimalarial treatment was not administered to a similar proportion of patients. These findings highlight the need to improve clinical care and management practices as reported by specialist panels, along with the importance of enhancing malaria prevention and control strategies.

### Clinical practices in neonatal oxygenation: where have we failed? What can we do? [^111nppwQ]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen is among the most frequently used therapies in neonates worldwide. Nevertheless, many times it is used unnecessarily. Neonatal practices have changed over the last several years; treatments originally believed to be beneficial have been discarded.

Study Design

Oxygen utilized 'just in case' or 'prophylactically' can lead to great damage previously ignored and/or unseen by healthcare providers. It is imperative to improve education on neonatal oxygenation and saturation monitoring. It is also important not to depend on old assumptions, which were not based on evidences. The potential for unseen damage at the cellular and tissue levels cannot be ignored. Therapies that prove to be outdated or even dangerous must be eliminated while further research and confirmation of the best practices are determined. Freedom to choose can come at a price.

### Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy diagnosis and treatment: a national survey in China [^113dgxQd]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of mortality and long-term disabilities in children. In spite of significant improvements in obstetric and neonatal care, HIE continues to occur in developed countries, with a disproportionately high burden persisting in low- and middle- income countries. HIE occurs in 1 to 3 per 1000 live births in high income countries, and up to 20 per 1000 live births in low and middle-income countries. There are 15–18 million live births in China each year, and the incidence of neonatal HIE is estimated to be 3–6 per 1000 live births. Neonatal HIE accounts for 15.2% of mortality under the age of five. Improving survival and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with HIE have a significant impact on national and global public health.

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for infants with moderate-severe HIE improves survival and decreases long-term disability in infancy and up to mid-childhood. TH has become the standard of care in developed countries. To standardize HIE diagnosis and implement evidence-based management of neonatal HIE in China, national guidelines have been published, including "Diagnosis of Hypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy in Term Infants" (hereinafter referred to as HIE diagnosis guideline), "Guideline of Evidence-based Treatment for Hypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy in Term Infants" (hereinafter referred to as HIE treatment guideline, Additional file 1), and "Protocol of Hypothermia Treatment for Hypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy in Neonates" (hereinafter referred to as TH protocol).

Standardization is essential to assure the efficacy and safety of TH in clinical practice and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Since the publications of the national HIE guidelines, many hospitals have implemented TH. However, there has been no report regarding standardization of HIE management and clinical adoption of TH in different types of hospitals throughout China. We conducted a nationwide survey to investigate the current status of neonatal HIE diagnosis, TH, and other HIE treatments, and long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up programs for infants who have survived HIE.

### Neonatal encephalopathy: when the diagnosis is not hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy [^1144amYh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) presents as reduced consciousness, often with seizures, abnormal tone, feeding and respiratory difficulties. The most common cause is secondary to a hypoxic-ischaemic event. However, there are many important diagnoses that can also present as NE, so-called 'hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) mimics'. This paper, aimed at paediatric trainees, aims to describe clinical situations in which a diagnosis other than HIE should be suspected, the differential diagnoses to consider and appropriate investigations.

### Respiratory distress in the newborn [^114D3FtC]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The most common etiology of neonatal respiratory distress is transient tachypnea of the newborn; this is triggered by excessive lung fluid, and symptoms usually resolve spontaneously. Respiratory distress syndrome can occur in premature infants as a result of surfactant deficiency and underdeveloped lung anatomy. Intervention with oxygenation, ventilation, and surfactant replacement is often necessary. Prenatal administration of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn when the risk of preterm delivery is high. Meconium aspiration syndrome is thought to occur in utero as a result of fetal distress by hypoxia. The incidence is not reduced by use of amnio-infusion before delivery nor by suctioning of the infant during delivery. Treatment options are resuscitation, oxygenation, surfactant replacement, and ventilation. Other etiologies of respiratory distress include pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and congenital malformations; treatment is disease specific. Initial evaluation for persistent or severe respiratory distress may include complete blood count with differential, chest radiography, and pulse oximetry.

### Hypoxia-ischemia is not an antecedent of most preterm brain damage: the illusion of validity [^113mRXF3]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Synthesis and Outlook

Hypoxia beyond the normal fetal hypoxic environment as an antecedent has not been documented as causing injury in the preterm fetus. The fetus has a different blood supply as blood pressure and flow relationships differ from those in the adult. The large number of pathological conditions attributed to hypoxia indicates that the term 'hypoxic encephalopathy' has limited predictive power. Experimental animal studies have failed to take anatomical differences into consideration, leave much to be desired, and have not resulted in therapeutic candidates.

Despite all studies in animals and humans, the evidence remains unconvincing that hypoxemia, in the fetus or newborn infant, contributes appreciably to any encephalopathy of prematurity. Thus, the criteria for attributing perinatal brain injury to hypoxemia have not been met.

We recommend that until evidence becomes available, hypoxia–ischemia should not be viewed as contributing to the occurrence of what is included under the umbrella of 'encephalopathy of prematurity'.

### Management and investigation of neonatal encephalopathy: 2017 update [^114cKszY]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is defined as a condition occurring in babies born over 35 weeks gestational age in which there is disturbed neurological function. The key feature is the disturbance in the degree or quality of consciousness; other features, such as seizures, cardiorespiratory compromise or abnormal tone and reflexes, may occur alongside it but are not necessary to make the diagnosis. In 2014, the Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy published new guidelines on criteria for retrospective definition of an intrapartum event sufficient to cause cerebral palsy (CP). The title of the report was changed from Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy to Neonatal Encephalopathy and Neurological Outcome to emphasise that there are many causes of encephalopathy in a newborn baby and that an array of developmental outcomes may arise in addition to CP. Knowledge gaps preclude a definitive test or set of markers that accurately identifies, with high sensitivity and specificity, an infant in whom NE is attributable to an acute intrapartum event. The term NE should be used where no definite aetiological diagnosis is known, and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) where clear diagnosis of hypoxia-ischaemia is known to have led to the neonate's clinical state.

### Carbon dioxide levels in neonates: what are safe parameters? [^112MTXyy]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In healthy neonates, the physiological CO 2 range is defined as 4.7–6.0 kPa (35.3–45.0 mmHg). Given the physiological impact of CO 2 levels on cerebral vasculature and the impact of CO 2 on immune signalling, it has been suggested that hyper- and hypocapnia can both have detrimental effects for newborn infants. While CO 2 monitoring can be undertaken on a continuous basis or intermittently with blood gas measurement, there is currently no consensus on the optimal pCO 2 levels in the newborn. Similarly, there is limited evidence as to what is clinical best-practice with respect to managing the care of neonates with moderate hypocapnia and hypercapnia.

Effects of hypocapnia

Hypocapnia in the neonate may be the result of a disease such as transient tachypnoea of the newborn, or more commonly, induced iatrogenically during mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Permanent brain injury may be caused by cerebral vasoconstriction and low cerebral tolerance of hypoxia, and hypocapnia may worsen ischaemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury. There is a correlation between the degree and duration of hypocapnia and the incidence and severity of these lesions. In both term and preterm neonates, hypocapnia can therefore be a risk factor for central nervous system damage which may manifest as cerebral palsy (CP), cognitive or developmental disabilities, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), periventricular white matter injury and auditory impairment.

### Acute injury to the immature brain with hypoxia with or without hypoperfusion [^111QRc1Q]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This article reviews the imaging features and evolution of immature brain injury caused by hypoxia with or without hypoperfusion in the neonate and young child. Clinical presentations and available literature on mechanisms and clinical outcomes are discussed. In many of these cases, diffusion-weighted imaging does not show the full extent of the injury but detects a pattern of injury that is important in guiding clinical care. Awareness of the delayed cell death mechanisms is essential to understand diffusion-weighted imaging sensitivity and evolution and to provide the most accurate clinical interpretation, especially in cases of hypoxia with or without hypoperfusion.

### Is perinatal asphyxia predictable? [^112bXPxo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cases of neonatal encephalopathy related to perinatal asphyxia are called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and can lead to long-term neurological sequelae and cerebral palsy.

The Sarnat and Sarnat classification is still the universally accepted scoring system to provide information about the prognosis for the asphyxiated neonate. This staging is based on the infant's clinical presentation, examination findings and the presence of seizures, with emphasis on the duration of symptoms.

Both clinical (Thompson scale) and instrumental (cerebral function monitor/aEEG) assessment are validated by international literature for classifying the severity of damage immediately after birth. This allows for initiating the correct treatment (ie Therapeutic Hypothermia) as soon as possible.

Perinatal asphyxia is defined as at least one of the following characteristics in a neonate: 10 min Apgar score ≤ 5, need for resuscitation > 10 min, metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.0 or BE ≤ -12 mMol/L in umbilical artery (UA) or within 1 h of life).

There is a dose-dependent relationship between the degree of acidosis and the likelihood of adverse neonatal outcome.

Both ante and intrapartum risk factors have been associated with perinatal asphyxia and HIE. Some of these are clinically recognized as asphyxial birth events (sentinel events): uterine rupture, placental abruptio, shoulder dystocia and cord prolapse. However, the majority of risk factors (preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, intrapartum fever, emergency delivery) seem to interact in the causal pathway to HIE rather than being its direct antecedent. In addition to the historically described risk factors, new ones have recently been identified, such as obesity and previous cesarean section. Nevertheless, results from a large registry of neonatal encephalopathy show that half of the neonates had neither asphyxia nor inflammatory indicators, suggesting that a large number of cases remain unexplained.

Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring provides important information about fetal status. However, its role in the prediction of fetal asphyxia remains controversial, despite efforts directed at its interpretation and the development of protocols for the management of abnormal patterns.

To summarize, there are a number of conditions that have been associated with the presence of perinatal asphyxia and its extreme consequence, HIE. Nevertheless, it is problematic to identify the sequence of events that leads to perinatal asphyxia during prenatal and intrapartum care.

In this context the objective of our study was to evaluate the association between perinatal asphyxia and HIE with the presence of risk factors and/or abnormal FHR findings in order to improve maternal and neonatal management.

### Neonatal encephalopathy: an inadequate term for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^113z1P7R]. Annals of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

This Point of View article addresses neonatal encephalopathy (NE) presumably caused by hypoxia-ischemia and the terminology currently in wide use for this disorder. The nonspecific term NE is commonly utilized for those infants with the clinical and imaging characteristics of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Multiple magnetic resonance imaging studies of term infants with the clinical setting of presumed hypoxia-ischemia near the time of delivery have delineated a topography of lesions highly correlated with that defined by human neuropathology and by animal models, including primate models, of hypoxia-ischemia. These imaging findings, coupled with clinical features consistent with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult(s), warrant the specific designation of neonatal HIE.

### Oxygen in health and disease: regulation of oxygen homeostasis – clinical implications [^111FXTdC]. Pediatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Oxygen is critical for multicellular existence. Its reduction to water by the mitochondrial electron transport chain helps supply the metabolic demands of human life. The incompletely reduced, reactive oxygen byproducts of this reaction, however, can be quite toxic. In this review, we explore the mechanisms responsible for maintaining oxygen homeostasis and the consequences of their dysfunction. With an eye toward defining clinical care guidelines for the management of critically ill neonates, we present evidence describing the role of physiologic hypoxia during development and the adverse consequences of hyperoxia in-term as well as preterm infants.

### Hypoxia-ischemia is not an antecedent of most preterm brain damage: the illusion of validity [^111pvXYD]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disorders identified by an etiological name

Despite a complete lack of evidence, encephalopathy of prematurity has been attributed to hypoxia (ischemia). Physicians seem to rely on a limited number of heuristic principles, which reduce the complex tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental operations. These heuristics sometimes lead to severe and systemic errors for which Tversky and Kahneman coined the term 'The illusion of validity'. 1 For instance, attributing a single cause to a disease should serve a purpose. Applying that attribution to the disease name, however, probably does not serve any useful purpose, as it is likely overly simplistic and potentially limits the options for change when our understanding of the etiologies advances.

To avoid errors associated with using an inappropriate causal label, some have suggested that the more general descriptive term 'neonatal encephalopathy' or 'newborn encephalopathy' should replace hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, 2 or have used the term 'encephalopathy of prematurity', 3 but have not turned away from the original term 'hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy'. 4 Given the term 'hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy', we are not surprised when most neonatal animal studies use some form of asphyxia. We are not denying that infants born very‐low‐birthweight and preterm are at risk of multiple neurological dysfunctions, multiple abnormalities on imaging, or multiple abnormalities at autopsy. We are suggesting that while hypoxia may be behind some abnormalities, most are the result of multiple contributions and consequently experimental work be directed toward other etiologies as well.

In this review, we focus on the encephalopathies seen in newborn infants born preterm, lesions attributed to hypoxia or hypoxia–ischemia, animal studies with their strengths and limitations, and conclude with the design of an ideal epidemiological study.

### Oxygen therapy of the newborn from molecular understanding to clinical practice [^113k8MyK]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Oxygen is one of the most critical components of life. Nature has taken billions of years to develop optimal atmospheric oxygen concentrations for human life, evolving from very low, peaking at 30% before reaching 20.95%. There is now increased understanding of the potential toxicity of both too much and too little oxygen, especially for preterm and asphyxiated infants and of the potential and lifelong impact of oxygen exposure, even for a few minutes after birth. In this review, we discuss the contribution of knowledge gleaned from basic science studies and their implication in the care and outcomes of the human infant within the first few minutes of life and afterwards. We emphasize current knowledge gaps and research that is needed to answer a problem that has taken Nature a considerably longer time to resolve.

### Aspects on oxygenation in preterm infants before, immediately after birth, and beyond [^1176NVJw]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Oxygen is crucial for life but too little (hypoxia) or too much (hyperoxia) may be fatal or cause lifelong morbidity.

Summary

In this review, we discuss the challenges of balancing oxygen control in preterm infants during fetal development, the first few minutes after birth, in the neonatal intensive care unit and after hospital discharge, where intensive care monitoring and response to dangerous oxygen levels is more often than not, out of reach with current technologies and services.

Key Messages

Appropriate oxygenation is critically important even from before birth, but at no time is the need to strike a balance more important than during the first few minutes after birth, when body physiology is changing at its most rapid pace. Preterm infants, in particular, have a poor control of oxygen balance. Underdeveloped organs, especially of the lungs, require supplemental oxygen to prevent hypoxia. However, they are also at risk of hyperoxia due to immature antioxidant defenses. Existing evidence demonstrate considerable challenges that need to be overcome before we can ensure safe treatment of preterm infants with one of the most commonly used drugs in newborn care, oxygen.

### Hypoxia-ischemia is not an antecedent of most preterm brain damage: the illusion of validity [^116x2cyS]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Brain injury in preterm newborn infants is often attributed to hypoxia–ischemia even when neither hypoxia nor ischemia is documented, and many causative speculations are based on the same assumption. We review human and animal study contributions with their strengths and limitations, and conclude that – despite all the work done in human fetal neuropathology and developmental models in animals – the evidence remains unconvincing that hypoxemia, in the fetus or newborn infant, contributes appreciably to any encephalopathy of prematurity. Giving an inappropriate causal name to a disorder potentially limits the options for change, should our understanding of the etiologies advance. The only observationally‐based title we think appropriate is 'encephalopathy of prematurity'. Future pathophysiological research should probably include appropriately designed epidemiology studies, highly active developmental processes, infection and other inflammatory stimuli, the immature immune system, long chain fatty acids and their transporters, and growth (neurotrophic) factors.

What this paper adds

Fetal hypoxemia is rarely documented in brain injury studies.
Animal studies fail to consider human–animal fetal anatomical differences.
Putative treatments from animal models have not found clinical use.
Observational studies constitute the only approach to etiological understanding.
No convincing evidence yet that hypoxemia injures preterm brain. Encephalopathy of prematurity is preferable to hypoxia‐ischemia as a term for this disorder.
Encephalopathy of prematurity is preferable to hypoxia‐ischemia as a term for this disorder.

### Mechanisms of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the term infant [^115T5ukW]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the term infant is multifactorial and complex. Over the past decade the investigative emphasis has turned to cellular and molecular mechanisms of injury, and it has been increasingly recognized that the neonatal brain differs vastly from the adult brain in terms of response to hypoxia-ischemia. This review will discuss the initiation and evolution of brain injury in the term neonate, and the inherent biochemical and physiologic qualities of the neonatal brain that make its response to hypoxia-ischemia unique. Attention will be given to specific areas of investigation including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The coalescence of these entities to a final common pathway of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury will be emphasized.

### Incidence and outcomes of intrapartum-related neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112biEF7]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020guidelines were followed and the study protocol was registered beforehand in PROSPERO database (CRD42020177928).

Eligibility criteria

Types of reports

All article types (observational and trial based) providing information on incidence, neonatal mortality or childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes of NE in humans were considered for inclusion. Qualitative studies, reviews, protocols, conference abstracts, editorials and opinion pieces were excluded.

Additional study characteristics

Only data from LMICs classified by World Bank country and lending groups at the median year of data collection were considered. Only reports published after 1 November 2009 were included as this was the last date searched by Lee et al in their previous reviewand as changes in peripartum care reduce the relevance of older studies. No language restrictions were applied.

Types of study participants

Neonatal encephalopathy

NE was defined clinically as disturbed neurological function diagnosed using criteria proposed by Sarnat and Sarnat or another validated scale within 24 hours of birth. A cut-off of 24 hours was selected to ensure early onset of symptoms commensurate with a hypoxic-ischaemic origin while acknowledging that the symptoms evolve over the first week of life. Due to limited availability in LMICs, electroencephalographic confirmation and neuroimaging were not mandated.

Relation to intrapartum events

Evidence of intrapartum hypoxia-ischaemia was required for inclusion to distinguish from other similar clinical phenotypes. Any of the following parameters was accepted for inclusion:

Abnormal umbilical cord blood or neonatal blood sample within 1 hour of birth (pH ≤ 7.1 or base excess ≤ −12 or lactate ≥ 6).
Apgar score ≤ 5 at 5 or 10 min.
Ongoing neonatal resuscitation at 5 or 10 min.
No cry from baby at 5 or 10 min.

Studies where stated hypoxia-ischaemia criteria were not fully concordant, but sentinel data were provided were discussed and decided case by case.

Gestational age

Gestational age limit was set to ≥ 35+0 weeks defined by last menstrual period, first trimester ultrasound, fundal height or Ballard score. Lack of data on gestational age or mixing term and preterm infants < 35 weeks of gestation in the report led to exclusion of the study to avoid contamination by non-hypoxic-ischaemic preterm brain injury.

### Consensus definition and diagnostic criteria for neonatal encephalopathy-study protocol for a real-time modified Delphi study [^115Lz1SD]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-asphyxial causes of NE include metabolic and genetic disorders, congenital neuromuscular disorders, infection or sepsis, and neonatal stroke. The ultimate diagnosis will depend on the results of physical examination, expert examination of the placenta, genetic and metabolic investigations, investigation for sepsis or meningitis where indicated, neuro-imaging as well as a thorough investigation of family history (of congenital malformations, neurologic or medical disorders), pre-conceptional, antepartum events, obstetric course, delivery, and postnatal events(Fig. 1). A proportion of infants with NE will be found to have one of a number of other diagnoses - congenital malformations, abnormal genetics/genomics, or known syndromes and stroke among many others. Infants in whom aetiology is thought to be secondary to a specific non-asphyxial conditions must be identified separately for clinical trials, targeting these individual conditions. Even within the subgroup diagnosis of HIE, there is heterogeneity seen, ranging from severe acute hypoxia-ischaemia from an acute cause to subacute, intermittent hypoxemia of the course of labour and the chronic hypoxemia of pregnancy that is most often related to placental issues and of course, combinations such as acute on chronic hypoxemia, among other causes.

### Aspects on oxygenation in preterm infants before, immediately after birth, and beyond [^112NLNTD]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen is the only drug on the World Health Organization list of 479 essential medicines that has no alternative; i.e. no other drug can be substituted for oxygen. Oxygen is critical for life but too little (hypoxia) or too much oxygen (hyperoxia) can be harmful, lead to serious morbidity, or even be fatal. Whilst the effects of hypoxia are well known in all humans, including newborn infants, hyperoxia is also indelibly linked to harm, including cerebral vasoconstriction, major organ injury, and in preclinical studies, neurodevelopmental impairment and death via mechanisms such as generation of reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress and damage to lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA. Oxygen control is especially important in premature infants who have immature lungs that require supplemental oxygen to prevent hypoxia but also inadequate antioxidant defenses raising susceptibility to oxygen stress, injury, and toxicity. It was not until relatively recently that the appreciation of the delicate balance between hypoxia and hyperoxia shifted to focus on the preterm infant.

The oxygen needs of the preterm infant, especially for those born at margins of viability, are complex and continue to be unclear and confounded by crucial knowledge gaps. For example, a hypoxemic in utero environment is necessary for normal lung development but severe postnatal hypoxia, especially in the first few minutes of life, may increase risk of death and serious morbidities. Oxygen needs may change again days to weeks after birth, particularly if there is evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) where oxygen is both a mainstay of treatment, and perpetrator in pathogenesis.

This narrative review will consider historical and emerging evidence informing current recommendations for oxygen therapy for the preterm infant. We will address aspects of oxygen of the fetus prior to birth, but also oxygen needs during the infant's first few minutes of life, during admission in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and after discharge home. We examine the challenges of applying concepts that are generated from research to clinical care, often within an NICU or home environment that has other competing factors for best practice. Finally, we highlight considerations for ongoing and emerging research which can be conducted to address critical knowledge gaps for ensuring safe and best treatment of the preterm infant with oxygen.

### Oxygen during neonatal resuscitation: too much vs too little, does it matter? [^115aE4cp]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Oxygen has been a key component of neonatal resuscitation for nearly two centuries. Based on clinical trials that demonstrated worse outcomes when neonatal resuscitation was initiated with 100% oxygen, there was a change in approach to using 21% oxygen at initiation of ventilation for newborns at birth. However, for extremely preterm newborns lower oxygen levels lead to early hypoxia and bradycardia leading to higher rates of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and death. The balance between hyperoxia and hypoxia related injury needs further refinement and may not be generalizable to all gestations and birth conditions.

Summary

This article reviews the current evidence on oxygen use during delayed cord clamping, during resuscitation of term and preterm neonates, during chest compressions, after return of spontaneous circulation and in the post-resuscitation phase, and the impact of hyperoxia.

Key Messages

Supplemental oxygen during neonatal resuscitation is actively being investigated by researchers worldwide to fill the knowledge gap to avoid hypoxia and hyperoxia while improving neonatal outcomes. Until further evidence emerges, we recommend starting resuscitation in the delivery room of very low birth weight infants with an FiO2 of 0.3 to 1, probably in the lower part of this scale, and titrating-up by 10–20% every 30 seconds to achieve target SpO2 for age. An SpO2 of 80–85% should be targeted by 5 minutes after birth.

### New horizons for newborn brain protection: enhancing endogenous neuroprotection [^112npCVC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intrapartum-related insults at full term such as hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) are the third leading cause of global child deaths. Each year, over 0.7 million affected newborns die and 1.15 million develop acute disordered brain function known as neonatal encephalopathy (NE).NE is the second commonest preventable cause of childhood neurodisability worldwidewith profound psychosocial and economic consequences for families and society. Protecting the newborn brain from injury around the time of birth is a global health priority.

### A systematic review of cooling for neuroprotection in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy-are we there yet? [^117MzC47]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Evidence from high quality RCTs indicates that overall, cooling of neonates with moderate to severe HIE reduces the risk of death or disability at 18 to 22 months without significant adverse effects. Despite the methodological differences, wide CIs, and lack of long-term follow-up data, the consistency of benefits and its sound scientific basis indicate that cooling may be an attractive option for neuroprotection in HIE – a condition that lacks any effective treatment at present.

### Neuroprotective therapies for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury-a contemporary update [^114GQ1kD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy of hypoxic-ischemic origin remains a leading cause of global neonatal mortality. Over the past decades, various neuroprotective strategies have been explored; however, therapeutic hypothermia remains the only clinically approved intervention to date. This review outlines emerging and adjunctive treatment modalities beyond therapeutic hypothermia and emphasizes the critical need for robust and reproducible translational research to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and clinical applications.

### Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy diagnosis and treatment: a national survey in China [^116FKKVg]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first national survey of neonatal HIE diagnosis and treatment conducted in China. The respondents were mainly senior pediatricians and neonatologists working in Level III hospitals across the country. Thus, findings from our survey provide a good representation of the current status of neonatal HIE diagnosis and treatment in China.

The 2005 updated Chinese national HIE diagnosis guideline requires meeting all of the following four criteria: (1) history of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic events and evidence of fetal distress, (2) Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min of ≤ 3 and ≤ 5, respectively, and or arterial blood gas pH ≤ 7, (3) evidence of encephalopathy, and (4) exclusion of other causes for encephalopathy. Our survey found that 96% of respondents used clinical manifestations of encephalopathy as HIE diagnostic criteria, but only 68% used arterial blood analysis as a diagnostic indicator. Physicians who were aware of the HIE diagnostic criteria were more likely to use arterial blood gas. This demonstrates that more education is needed to emphasize the value of cord blood gas analysis in providing essential evidence of acute hypoxic-ischemic insults to the fetus during labor and delivery. Additionally, placing designated blood gas analyzers may facilitate the utilization of blood gas by labor and delivery departments that have thousands of deliveries each year. The HIE diagnostic guideline also recommends using EEG/aEEG and brain imaging (preferably MRI when available) to obtain information on brain injury and prognosis. In our survey, only 56% of hospitals utilized EEG/aEEG, and 73% used brain MRI, which represents an significant opportunity to improve HIE diagnosis and prognosis.

### Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and hypothermia treatment [^116AEAA6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an important clinical entity because it is associated with death and long-term disability, including cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy, seizures, and neurosensory deficits. Over the past 40 years, there has been an intensive search to identify therapies to improve the prognosis of neonates with HIE. Hypothermia treatment represents the culmination of laboratory investigations including small and large animal studies, followed by pilot human studies, and, finally, randomized controlled trials to establish efficacy and safety. Clinical trials have demonstrated that hypothermia treatment reduces mortality and improves early childhood outcome among survivors. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a multi-system disease process that requires intensive medical support for brain monitoring and monitoring of non-central nervous system organ dysfunction. Treatment must be conducted in a level III or IV neonatal intensive care unit with infrastructure for an integrated approach to care for critically ill neonates. Hypothermia treatment is the first and currently the only therapy to improve outcomes for neonates with HIE and indicates that HIE is modifiable. However, outcomes likely can be improved further. Hypothermia treatment has accelerated investigation of other therapies to combine with hypothermia. It has also stimulated a more intensive approach to brain monitoring, which allows earlier intervention for complications. Finally, HIE and hypothermia treatment negatively influences the psychological state of affected families, and there is growing recognition of the importance of trauma-informed principles to guide medical professionals.

### Oxygen for newborns: how much is too much? [^112VaRFB]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

International guidelines for newborn resuscitation recommend the use of 100% oxygen. However, high concentrations of oxygen after asphyxiation activate reactive oxygen species that may contribute to a number of morbidities. Animal models have been useful in describing their mechanisms, but only large-scale clinical trials can provide evidence that may be used to alter clinical practice. It has been demonstrated that neonates recover faster when resuscitated with room air as opposed to pure oxygen and neonatal mortality rates are improved. Increases in saturation are equal with oxygen and room air resuscitation. Studies of normal oxygen saturation immediately after birth suggest that clinicians may unnecessarily be rushing to high saturations. In the first weeks of life, lower saturation targets in preterm infants reduce retinopathy of prematurity and pulmonary complications and may improve growth. The neonatologist would be well served to think of oxygen as a medication, and use it sparingly.

### Use of therapeutic hypothermia for term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^114Tz2PB]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Newborn encephalopathy represents a clinical syndrome with diverse causes, many of which may result in brain injury. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy represents a subset of newborns with encephalopathy and, in contrast to other causes, may have a modifiable outcome. Laboratory research has demonstrated robust neuroprotection associated with reductions of brain temperature following hypoxia-ischemia in animals. The neuroprotective effects of hypothermia reflect antagonism of multiple cascades of events that contribute to brain injury. Clinical trials have translated laboratory observations into successful interventions. Hypoxicischemic encephalopathy is often unanticipated, unavoidable, and may occur in any obstetric setting. Pediatricians and other providers based in community hospitals play a critical role in the initial assessment, recognition, and stabilization of infants who may be candidates for therapeutic hypothermia.

### Incidence and outcomes of intrapartum-related neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123x6Xa]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a syndrome of disturbed neurological function presenting during the first days of life. Hallmarks of NE include decreased level of consciousness or seizures, difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration, and altered tone and reflexes. Intrapartum-related hypoxia-ischaemia is the most common cause of NE and one of the top three causes of neonatal death globally. Nearly half of the survivors of intrapartum-related NE risk neurodevelopmental disability including cerebral palsy (CP), intellectual impairment, deafness and blindness. These risks are related to the severity of encephalopathy commonly graded as mild, moderate or severe, or grade I, II, III, respectively, based on early neurological examination. Intrapartum-related NE is a term primarily used in reference to term and near-term infants.

The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013estimated 1.15 million cases of intrapartum-related NE globally per year resulting in 287 000 neonatal deaths and 233 000 moderate or severe disabilities: 96% occurred in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given global increase in facility deliveriesand improved neonatal resuscitationduring the decade that has elapsed since, the situation has likely changed. Without data, though, the task of the policymakers becomes near impossible. Reducing the burden of intrapartum-related NE is one of the key factors for achieving the Every Newborn Action Plan. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of intrapartum-related NE in LMICs with the objective of quantifying the following parameters: (1) incidence, (2) neonatal mortality and (3) neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up of ≥ 1 year.

### A systematic review of cooling for neuroprotection in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy-are we there yet? [^112NQkgm]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) following perinatal asphyxia contributes significantly to neonatal mortality and morbidity including long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae in up to 25%-60% of survivors. Despite significant research there is still no proven intervention for neuroprotection in HIE. The literature on therapeutic hypothermia as a treatment for "white asphyxia" dates as far back as early 60s. Experimental studies have shown that mild to moderate hypothermia (33–34°C), applied within the first hours of an acute hypoxic event, is neuroprotective. A Cochrane review incorporating two small randomized controlled trials (RCT) has reported no evidence of benefit or harm related to therapeutic hypothermia in term neonates (N = 50) with HIE. Three large RCTs have been published since the last substantive amendment of this systematic review in July 2003. Given the significance of the condition, and the encouraging results of the recent RCTs, an up to date systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic hypothermia in term neonates with HIE.

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^116i4P6T]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimizing ventilation strategies in infant resuscitation: Point of convergence

Hypoxia, secondary to respiratory failure, leading to bradycardia, is the most common precipitating cause of IHCA in infants, which both NRP and PALS acknowledge in their guidelines. The focus of the initial steps of resuscitation should be to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. NRP recommends rescue breathing at 40–60 per minute before starting CC and 30 breaths per minute during coordinated CC. This recommendation is based on the observational data of the average respiratory rates among infants. PALS recommends rescue breathing at a rate of 20–30 per minute before and during CC. This recent recommendation change was provided for the ease of training with limited evidence. PALS has acknowledged the critical knowledge gap due to insufficient pediatric data regarding the optimal ventilation rate during CPR in patients with or without an advanced airway and whether the ventilation rate is age-dependent. A systematic review of observational studies found that the respiratory rates declined from a median of 44 per minute at birth to 26 per minute at the end of 2 years, which continued to decline until early adolescence. Given the differences in respiratory rates and the algorithm, is it reasonable to resuscitate all infants per NRP during an IHCA, especially in the NICU?

### Hypothermia for the treatment of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^1121ZSmy]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy affects 2 to 5 of every 1000 live births and represents a major cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in affected infants. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the major cause of encephalopathy in the neonatal period. Until recently, management of a newborn with encephalopathy has consisted largely of supportive care to restore and maintain cerebral perfusion, provide adequate gas exchange and treat seizure activity. Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that mild therapeutic hypothermia (cooling) initiated within 6h of birth reduces death and disability in these infants. Cooling can be accomplished through whole-body cooling or selective head cooling. Meta-analysis of these trials suggests that for every six or seven infants with moderate to severe HIE who are treated with mild hypothermia, there will be one fewer infant who dies or has significant neurodevelopmental disability. In response to this evidence, major policy makers and guideline developers have recommended that cooling therapy be offered to infants with moderate to severe HIE. The dissemination of this new therapy will require improved identification of infants with HIE and regional commitment to allow these infants to be cared for in a timely manner.

### Neuroprotection for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: a review of novel therapies evaluated in clinical studies [^115V7CjK]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
Several promising neuroprotective agents are under clinical investigation in neonates with hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy.
Novel neuroprotective therapies are being tested both with and without concomitant therapeutic hypothermia.

Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a term that describes neurological dysfunction in a newborn infant resulting from inadequate oxygen and blood flow to a fetus's brain occurring near the time of birth. Neonatal HIE affects 1 to 2 per 1000 live births in high‐resource countries, and accounts for over half a million deaths every year globally. Therapeutic hypothermia is an established therapy for the treatment of infants with moderate‐to‐severe neonatal HIE, with about 40% of affected infants suffering death or adverse neurodevelopmental consequences at 2 years of age despite this treatment. Furthermore, longer‐term studies are revealing that despite earlier reassurance, many children who receive therapeutic hypothermia go on to show significant challenges with motor, cognitive, behavioral, and executive function by school age. There is an urgent need for ancillary therapies that can provide additional neuroprotection in conjunction with therapeutic hypothermia in high‐resource countries.

In low‐ and middle‐income countries where the majority of infants with neonatal HIE are born, therapeutic hypothermia is not provided. Given that a recent multicenter randomized trial in South Asia found that therapeutic hypothermia was not effective for infants with moderate‐to‐severe HIE in this setting, there is an equally urgent need to develop novel neuroprotective therapies for neonatal HIE without concurrent therapeutic hypothermia, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. In this review, we discuss novel therapies that have exhibited promising neuroprotective properties in animal studies of neonatal HIE, and that have been the subject of clinical investigation in neonates with HIE both in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia, and as monotherapy without concomitant therapeutic hypothermia (Table 1).

### Intrapartum-related neonatal encephalopathy incidence and impairment at regional and global levels for 2010 with trends from 1990 [^114xrBoj]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Definitions and Measurement

Figure 1 illustrates the pathways and adverse outcomes related to intrapartum complications, and Table 3 defines the epidemiologic terminology used in this paper. The language used for this condition and related outcomes has changed over time as a result of clarification of the epidemiology as well as concerns over litigation (Table 1).

"Birth asphyxia" was broadly defined by the WHO as "failing to initiate or maintain regular breathing at birth". This clinical diagnosis is commonly referred to as neonatal respiratory depression and indicated by low Apgar scores, which were intended to be sensitive and nonspecific (Figure 1). "Asphyxia" was commonly assumed to result from insults during pregnancy and childbirth, with associated hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. However, neonatal respiratory depression may have other etiologies such as preterm birth, infection, maternal analgesia, congenital malformations, or metabolic disorders and is not predictive of long-term outcomes. In low-resource settings with poor intrapartum care and low access to neonatal resuscitation, some of these nonbreathing babies will die immediately in the delivery room or within a few hours of life.

For those infants suffering a severe hypoxic event who do not die immediately, some infants will develop NE — a "disturbance of neurological function in the earliest days of life (onset: 1–3 d of life) in the term infant manifested by difficulty initiating and maintaining respiration, depression of tone or reflexes, abnormal level of consciousness, and often by seizures". Staging of NE was first defined by Sarnat and Sarnat using clinical and electroencephalogram criteria, with classification into mild, moderate, and severe stages (Table 4). Subsequently several other clinical classifications have been used (Supplementary Information online). NE is strongly predictive of long-term impairment and clearer to diagnose than neonatal respiratory depression, and impairment after an intrapartum hypoxic insult is uncommon in the absence of NE. For those reasons, our estimates use NE as the starting point to estimate long-term impairment associated with intrapartum hypoxic events, rather than neonatal respiratory depression or low Apgar score (Figure 1).

### Magnitude of neonatal asphyxia and its predictors among newborns at public hospitals of wolaita zone in Southern Ethiopia, 2023 [^117Ej3K2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the main causes of early newborn mortality is birth asphyxia, which is defined as the inability to establish breathing during birth and accounts for an estimated 900,000 deaths annually and obstetrical problems are the most frequent cause of it. it is a main clinical problem that happens throughout the world and increases the risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity, and It is a condition which affects a newborn and results in decreased oxygen perfusion to various organs. It affects 2 to 10 cases per 1000 full-term babies; however it affects premature babies more frequent.

Globally, most of the neonatal mortality (75%) happens within the first week of the neonatal period and About 1 million newborns die within the first 24 h,… According to WHO statistics in developing country every year 120 million infants born, from this 3% develop birth asphyxia and it is responsible for 23% of newborn deaths in low-income countries, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for 38% of these deaths.

### Neonatal advanced life support. airway and ventilation management [^112bBJCf]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation oxygen balance — insights and implications emphasize that the balance between providing too little or too much oxygen is a challenge in neonatal resuscitation. Perinatal hypoxia and too little supplemental oxygen can lead to end-organ damage, while hyperoxia is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow and formation of oxygen free radicals, which factor into reperfusion injury during reoxygenation after asphyxia and multisystemic injuries. Once neonatal bradycardia has resolved and chest compressions are no longer needed, different methods can be employed for delivery of oxygen at a concentration that meets oxygen saturation target levels, thus avoiding both hypoxia and hyperoxia.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) — burden, therapy, and associated hemodynamics: HIE is one of the leading causes of neonatal mortality worldwide and contributes to nearly 900,000 neonatal deaths each year. Therapeutic hypothermia has become standard of care therapy in the developed world, with evidence from randomized trials suggesting both a morbidity and mortality benefit. Observational studies have suggested that deranged cerebral blood flow during the first 3 to 4 postnatal days may be associated with a greater likelihood of abnormal brain outcomes. RV dysfunction is a common co-traveler with HIE, in part because of a common mechanistic origin.

Pediatric-specific guidelines — neonatal resuscitation pulse oximetry and oxygen targets: Measuring pulse oximetry on the right hand is stated to provide the most accurate oxygen saturation in transitional infants, with At 60 seconds, 60% is the target and an increase of 5% every minute until 5 minutes of life when pulse oximetry is 80–85%. Table 2 projects expected rise from birth: 1 minute 60–65%, 2 minutes 65–70%, 3 minutes 70–75%, 4 minutes 75–80%, 5 minutes 80–85%, and 10 minutes 85–90%. Both hypoxia and excess oxygen administration can result in harm to the infant, and if prolonged oxygen use is required, titrate to maintain an oxygen saturation of 85–95%.

### Exogenous pulmonary surfactant in COVID-19 ARDS. the similarities to neonatal RDS suggest a new scenario for an' old' strategy [^116xobcM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal RDS, previously also referred to as hyaline membrane disease, is largely secondary to the immaturity of the alveolar epithelium, causing surfactant deficiency in the immature preterm lung. It is widely accepted that increased surface tension in the lungs of preterm infants is primarily responsible for the hypoxia and atelectasis, characteristic features of neonatal RDS, which has proven responsive to exogenous surfactant therapy. Over the last decade, the management of preterm infants with neonatal RDS has changed due to the move toward using early continuous positive pressure ventilation and keeping exogenous surfactant therapy as a rescue remedy if the infant does not improve.

Interestingly, initial thoughts concerning the causation of neonatal RDS had focused on concepts of pulmonary vascular pathology leading to hypoperfusionand activation of the coagulation cascade. As in RDS, these microthrombotic phenomena are also described in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, generating pulmonary hypoperfusion in COVID-19 lung disease. Microvascular coagulation disorders in neonatal RDS were not responsive to fibrinolytic therapy. Similarly, in COVID-19 lung disease, preliminary results of therapeutic intravenous unfractionated heparin do not seem to improve outcome, despite this treatment is still under extensive investigation by ongoing RCTs.

As stated above, preterm infants with neonatal RDS demonstrate high alveolar surface tension and low compliance of the respiratory system(Crs). In clinical practice, administration of surfactant either as prophylaxis or rescue rapidly results in the lung being able to expand, with Crs improvement and consequent low ventilatory pressures needed to generate tidal volume. The clinical presentation (table 1) in critically ill patients with COVID-19 lung disease is reminiscent of the preterm infant with RDS. Clinical symptoms of respiratory distress and severe hypoxia are described in both these patient groups. Furthermore, the histology is also similar because they both demonstrate alveolar infiltration, hyaline membranes and oedema. Moreover, the use of corticosteroids seems to be effective in both scenarios, antenatal administration for neonatal RDSand during acute respiratory failure under oxygen delivery in COVID-19(table 1).

### To cool or not to cool? Hypothermia treatment outside trial criteria [^111pWrkX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Most infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy fit the clinical criteria used in the main randomised controlled trials. Many infants who would not strictly have qualified for trial entry may nevertheless benefit from hypothermia. These may include infants presenting with postnatal collapse, infants with neonatal stroke and moderately preterm infants. Given the relative safety and potential lifelong benefits of hypothermia treatment, all patients who may benefit from cooling should receive it in a timely and consistent manner. This article reviews several clinical scenarios where cooling may be considered for neuroprotection and provides practical management guidance based on available evidence. The authors emphasise the importance of clear communication with parents and of maintaining national registers to record practices.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline: inhaled nitric oxide for neonates with acute hypoxic respiratory failure [^112vQKyj]. Respiratory Care (2010). Medium credibility.

Neonatal INO response assessment and continuation — due to the rapid onset of action, a response, if present, can be seen quickly (within 1 hour), and evidence is lacking for benefit of continuing INO therapy in patients who do not demonstrate a response in terms of improved oxygenation; because of costs, its continued use without improvement cannot be supported by the available evidence. When INO is initiated, the clinician should ensure (as much as possible) that the lungs are adequately inflated and that sufficient mean airway pressure is being applied to maintain end-expiratory lung volume.

### Neonatal hypoxia results in peripheral nerve abnormalities [^1118zmCK]. The American Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Although the adverse effects of neonatal hypoxia associated with premature birth on the central nervous system are well known, the contribution of hypoxic damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has not been addressed. We demonstrate that neonatal hypoxia results in hypomyelination and delayed axonal sorting in mice leading to electrophysiological and motor deficits that persist into adulthood. These findings support a potential role for PNS hypoxic damage in the motor impairment that results from premature birth and suggest that therapies designed to protect the PNS may provide clinical benefit.

### Immature control of breathing and apnea of prematurity: the known and unknown [^113m4BLT]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This narrative review provides a broad perspective on immature control of breathing, which is universal in infants born premature. The degree of immaturity and severity of clinical symptoms are inversely correlated with gestational age. This immaturity presents as prolonged apneas with associated bradycardia or desaturation, or brief respiratory pauses, periodic breathing, and intermittent hypoxia. These manifestations are encompassed within the clinical diagnosis of apnea of prematurity, but there is no consensus on minimum criteria required for diagnosis. Common treatment strategies include caffeine and noninvasive respiratory support, but other therapies have also been advocated with varying effectiveness. There is considerable variability in when and how to initiate and discontinue treatment. There are significant knowledge gaps regarding effective strategies to quantify the severity of clinical manifestations of immature breathing, which prevent us from better understanding the long-term potential adverse outcomes, including neurodevelopment and sudden unexpected infant death.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) — echocardiography indications note that therapeutic hypothermia results in peripheral vasoconstriction, which may mask hypoperfusion, and that RV dysfunction and PH may be present despite relatively subtle clinical symptoms; therefore, all infants with HIE who present with cardiovascular instability or hypoxemic respiratory failure, and/or require vasoactive agents, should undergo timely standard TNE, and screening echocardiography may be beneficial because of the poor reliability of common markers of systemic perfusion (e.g., elevated lactate, decreased urinary output).

### Emerging therapies and management for neonatal encephalopathy-controversies and current approaches [^112NHRtJ]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) continues to have a major impact on newborn survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes worldwide. In high-income settings, therapeutic hypothermia is the only established standard treatment for neonates with moderate-to-severe NE, with compelling evidence that cooling reduces mortality and major neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors. Despite therapeutic hypothermia, a significant proportion of cooled infants continue to suffer long-term disability from brain injury. Innovative therapies offer the possibility of further improving neurodevelopmental outcomes by working synergistically with therapeutic hypothermia to decrease hypoxia-ischemia-induced excitotoxicity, prevent progression to secondary energy failure, and in some cases, promote neuroregeneration in the developing neonatal brain. This review discusses emerging NE therapies currently under investigation, offers insight into controversies surrounding various approaches to clinical care during therapeutic hypothermia, and identifies ongoing knowledge deficits that hinder attainment of optimal outcomes for neonates with NE.

This novel finding challenged decades of practice and created a paradigm shift in resuscitation guidance. From 2005, consensus on science and treatment recommendations stated for the first time that either air (21% oxygen) or 100% oxygen could be used to initiate respiratory support of hypoxic/asphyxiated term/near term infants if oxygen was not available. In some countries like Australia, guidelines stated that air should be used for all infants regardless of gestation, due to concerns for oxidative stress and injury with the use of 100% oxygen.

### Effects of targeting lower versus higher arterial oxygen saturations on death or disability in preterm infants [^112AXAX1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of supplemental oxygen in the care of extremely preterm infants has been common practice since the 1940s. Despite this, there is little agreement regarding which oxygen saturation (SpO₂) ranges to target to maximise short- or long-term growth and development, while minimising harms. There are two opposing concerns. Lower oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ at 90% or less) may impair neurodevelopment or result in death. Higher oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ greater than 90%) may increase severe retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease. The use of pulse oximetry to non-invasively assess neonatal SpO₂ levels has been widespread since the 1990s. Until recently there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had assessed whether it is better to target higher or lower oxygen saturation levels in extremely preterm infants, from birth or soon thereafter. As a result, there is significant international practice variation and uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target oxygen saturation levels in preterm and low birth weight infants.

Objectives

1. What are the effects of targeting lower versus higher oxygen saturation ranges on death or major neonatal and infant morbidities, or both, in extremely preterm infants?2. Do these effects differ in different types of infants, including those born at a very early gestational age, or in those who are outborn, without antenatal corticosteroid coverage, of male sex, small for gestational age or of multiple birth, or by mode of delivery?

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 11 April 2016), Embase (1980 to 11 April 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to 11 April 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that enrolled babies born at less than 28 weeks' gestation, at birth or soon thereafter, and targeted SpO₂ ranges of either 90% or below or above 90% via pulse oximetry, with the intention of maintaining such targets for at least the first two weeks of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to extract data from the published reports of the included studies. We sought some additional aggregate data from the original investigators in order to align the definitions of two key outcomes. We conducted the meta-analyses with Review Manager 5 software, using the Mantel-Haenszel method for estimates of typical risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) and a fixed-effect model. We assessed the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' and GRADE criteria in order to establish the quality of the evidence. We investigated heterogeneity of effects via pre-specified subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Five trials, which together enrolled 4965 infants, were eligible for inclusion. The investigators of these five trials had prospectively planned to combine their data as part of the NeOProM (Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis) Collaboration. We graded the quality of evidence as high for the key outcomes of death, major disability, the composite of death or major disability, and necrotising enterocolitis; and as moderate for blindness and retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment. When an aligned definition of major disability was used, there was no significant difference in the composite primary outcome of death or major disability in extremely preterm infants when targeting a lower (SpO₂ 85% to 89%) versus a higher (SpO₂ 91% to 95%) oxygen saturation range (typical RR 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.10; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05; 5 trials, 4754 infants) (high-quality evidence). Compared with a higher target range, a lower target range significantly increased the incidence of death at 18 to 24 months corrected age (typical RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.31; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 5 trials, 4873 infants) (high-quality evidence) and necrotising enterocolitis (typical RR 1.24, 95% 1.05 to 1.47; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; 5 trials, 4929 infants; I² = 0%) (high-quality evidence). Targeting the lower range significantly decreased the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment (typical RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; 5 trials, 4089 infants; I² = 69%) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for major disability including blindness, severe hearing loss, cerebral palsy, or other important neonatal morbidities. A subgroup analysis of major outcomes by type of oximeter calibration software (original versus revised) found a significant difference in the treatment effect between the two software types for death (interaction P = 0.03), with a significantly larger treatment effect seen for those infants using the revised algorithm (typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.68; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10; 3 trials, 1716 infants). There were no other important differences in treatment effect shown by the subgroup analyses using the currently available data.

Authors' Conclusions

In extremely preterm infants, targeting lower (85% to 89%) SpO₂ compared to higher (91% to 95%) SpO₂ had no significant effect on the composite outcome of death or major disability or on major disability alone, including blindness, but increased the average risk of mortality by 28 per 1000 infants treated. The trade-offs between the benefits and harms of the different oxygen saturation target ranges may need to be assessed within local settings (e.g. alarm limit settings, staffing, baseline outcome risks) when deciding on oxygen saturation targeting policies.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in the neonatal intensive care unit — infants with HIE and hemodynamic instability and/or oxygenation failure should undergo standard targeted neonatal echocardiography (TNE) as soon as feasible to appraise pulmonary pressures, myocardial function, and cardiac output. Hemodynamically stable patients with moderate to severe HIE may benefit from screening to evaluate for subclinical disease and support prognostication.

### Hypoxia-ischemia is not an antecedent of most preterm brain damage: the illusion of validity [^1173HrSe]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Consequently, the likelihood of misclassification deserves consideration as we assess the quality of these studies. Indeed, the authors of the meta‐analysis concluded, 'Using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, we found that the quality of evidence for these outcomes (including neurodevelopmental outcomes) was moderate to low. 21

With this caveat, the risk of a GMFCS level at or above II was not significantly elevated in the SUPPORT trial (risk ratio = 1.2; 0.7–2.1), the COT trial (risk ratio = 0.97; 0.6–1.67), or the BOOST‐NZ trial (risk ratio = 0.7; 0.2–2.2). In a meta‐analysis combining all three studies, the risk ratio was very close to 1.0 (risk ratio = 1.03; 0.7–1.5). 21 Thus, we can say, given the limited evidence available, that hypoxia at levels clinicians can tolerate does not appear to increase the risk of motor limitation at 18 to 24 months. This statement is especially important in light of evidence that the restricted levels of oxygen appear to increase the risk of death. Death? Yes. Disability? No.

The only observational study that evaluated the hypothesis that oxygen lack is an antecedent of white matter injury, CP, low Bayley Scales, and microcephaly in newborn infants born extremely preterm found that every one of the five blood gas derangements during the first three postnatal days (hypoxemia, hyperoxemia, hypocapnia, hypercapnia, and acidemia) was associated with multiple indicators of brain injury. 23 The patterns of associations varied considerably and not necessarily in a cohesive manner. Rather than inferring that the blood gas derangements caused the brain injury, a more plausible interpretation is that the multiple derangements are indicators of immaturity/vulnerability and illness severity.

In light of these reports, we draw the inference that no documentation has yet been provided that hypoxia contributes to brain injury in very preterm newborn infants, even when such levels of hypoxia appear to increase the risk of death.

### Multi-organ dysfunction across the neonatal encephalopathy spectrum [^117K2ZAJ]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), the leading cause of neonatal encephalopathy (NE), primarily affects the central nervous system and is associated with multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) and long-term complications. Research often focuses on moderate to severe NE, with limited data on mild cases.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and severity of MOD in neonates with mild NE and explore its association with HIE severity.

Methods

Term neonates with NE related to HIE diagnosis between 2009 and 2023 were included. Sarnat staging was used to classify cases into mild and moderate/severe. MOD was assessed on days 1 and 3 post-birth through echocardiography, troponin levels, creatinine levels, urine output, and liver function tests.

Results

Among 452 neonates with HIE (185 mild, 267 moderate/severe), 57% had liver injury, 55% cardiac injury, and 44% kidney injury in the first day of life. Neonates with mild NE had a MOD rate of 23%, lower than the 37% observed in moderate/severe (p = 0.002). When compared to mild, infants with moderate/severe NE had significantly higher incidences of cardiac (69% vs. 31%; p < 0.001), renal (49% vs. 38%; p = 0.067), and hepatic abnormalities (65% vs. 45%; p = 0.005).

Conclusions

This study highlights the risk of extra-cranial organ injury even in infants with mild NE, stressing the importance of monitoring all regardless of severity.

Impact

Comprehensive study prospectively evaluating end-organ dysfunction in a cohort of neonates diagnosed with mild, moderate, and severe NE.

### Neuroprotection for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: a review of novel therapies evaluated in clinical studies [^1149M5Ge]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Therapeutic hypothermia is an effective therapy for moderate‐to‐severe hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in infants born at term or near‐term in high‐resource settings. Yet there remains a substantial proportion of infants who do not benefit or who will have significant disability despite therapeutic hypothermia. Novel investigational therapies that may confer additional neuroprotection by targeting known pathogenic mechanisms of hypoxic–ischemic brain injury are under development. This review focuses on putative neuroprotective agents that have shown promise in animal models of HIE, and that have been translated to clinical studies in neonates with HIE. We include agents that have been studied both with and without concurrent therapeutic hypothermia. Our review therefore addresses not just neonatal HIE in high‐resource countries where therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of care, but also neonatal HIE in low‐ and middle‐income countries where therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to be ineffective, and where the greatest burden of HIE‐related morbidity and mortality exists.

Neonatal resuscitation — management when heart rate is greater than 100 BPM emphasizes oxygenation and ventilation: monitor for central cyanosis and provide blow-by oxygen as needed. If there are signs of respiratory distress, and if apneic or in significant respiratory distress, ventilate using bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation with room air at 40–60 breaths per minute; positive pressure ventilation with bag-mask device may be initiated with room air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies, otherwise use 100% oxygen, with goal SpO2 at 10 minutes 85–95%. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines.

Methods

Study design and setting

This was a prospective study conducted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) between November 2019 and March 2020. BMC is a referral, consultant, and university teaching hospital in Mwanza, with a catchment population of 14 million people in the Lake Zone. Neonates may be born here if the pregnancies are identified as high-risk or admitted following referral from a lower-tier hospital. The centre has 950 beds in total, with 15 cots in the NICU for severely ill patients. Parental consent was sought for participation, and information on neonatal health was obtained from the patients' medical records.

Study population inclusion and exclusion criteria

The study enrolled prospective neonates admitted at NICU and whose parents/guardians voluntarily consented to participate on their behalf. All neonates admitted to the neonatal unit were eligible. During the study period, 165 neonates were enrolled. Neonates admitted to NICU typically have low birthweight (< 2500 g), breath abnormally (outside 30–60 breaths/minute), have temperate below or above the healthy range of 36.5 °C to 37.5 °C or a fifth minute Apgar score below 7 and/or failure to establish spontaneous breathing after delivery. Diagnosis of sepsis was based on risk factors, clinical signs and symptoms such as fluctuation in body temperature, difficult in breathing, hypoglycaemia, lethargy, convulsions, jaundice and others as documented on WHO Young Infant Study Group and its methodology paper. Preterm neonates were defined as babies who were born alive under 37 completed gestation weeks. Birth asphyxia in this setting was defined as failure to initiate or sustain spontaneous breathing at birth and/or a fifth minute Apgar score < 7.00. Clinically respiratory distress in preterm neonates was defined from clinical manifestation of abnormal pulmonary function and hypoxia presented with tachypnoea, nasal flaring, intercostal, subxiphoid and subcostal retraction, cyanosis, and decreased auscultated breath sound.

### Mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE): timing and pattern of MRI brain injury [^117DqXQZ]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), an important cause of neonatal encephalopathy (NE), affects approximately 1.5 out of every 1000 live birthsand is a major cause for developmental disability in children, leading to cerebral palsy, seizures, and cognitive impairment. Severity of HIE is clinically evaluated, commonly using the Sarnat grading system. Neonates with mild encephalopathy by Sarnat grading are considered to have a more favorable neurodevelopmental prognosis. For this reason, randomized controlled trials testing therapeutic hypothermia, (TH) and other neuroprotective therapies for HIE, have excluded mild HIE patients.

In recent years, mild HIE has been increasingly linked to adverse outcomes including brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment. For instance, recent studies suggest that 38–61% – of neonates with mild HIE have abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a similar proportion as described in the moderate to severe HIE population. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of functional outcomes identified neurodevelopmental impairment in up to 25% of infants with mild HIE.

The timing of brain injury in infants with mild HIE has not been well studied. Whether the brain injury seen in infants with mild HIE occurred remote from the time of birth allowing the infant time to partially recover by the time of delivery is unknown. A better understanding of the timing and pattern of brain injury in mild HIE may help inform future studies of novel treatments. We examined the timing, pattern, and severity of MRI brain injury in a multicenter cohort of infants with mild HIE.

### Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and hypothermia: a critical look [^115is7s1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is a rare condition associated with high neonatal mortality and morbidity. Two randomized clinical trials have recently been published showing potentially promising results with hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy. Additional clinical trials are underway to test cooling as a therapeutic modality for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Outcome information about infants treated with hypothermia is available for children up to approximately 2 years of age. Longer-term outcome (ie, school age information) is currently lacking with respect to benefit and risk. Therapeutic hypothermia offers a potentially promising therapy for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Hypothermia for encephalopathy should be considered an evolving therapy because of lack of long-term safety and efficacy data.

### Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: a review for the clinician [^117RkKcv]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 1 to 8 per 1000 live births in developed countries. Historically, the clinician has had little to offer neonates with HIE other than systemic supportive care. Recently, the neuroprotective therapy of hypothermia has emerged as the standard of care, and other complementary therapies are rapidly transitioning from the basic science to clinical care.

Objective

To examine the pathophysiology of HIE and the state of the art for the clinical care of neonates with HIE.

Evidence Review

We performed a literature review using the PubMed database. Results focused on reviews and articles published from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014. Articles published earlier than 2004 were included when appropriate for historical perspective. Our review emphasized evidence-based management practices for the clinician.

Findings

A total of 102 articles for critical review were selected based on their relevance to the incidence of HIE, pathophysiology, neuroimaging, placental pathology, biomarkers, current systemic supportive care, hypothermia, and emerging therapies for HIE and were reviewed by both of us. Seventy-five publications were selected for inclusion in this article based on their relevance to these topics. The publications highlight the emergence of serum-based biomarkers, placental pathology, and magnetic resonance imaging as useful tools to predict long-term outcomes. Hypothermia and systemic supportive care form the cornerstone of therapy for HIE.

Conclusions and Relevance

The pathophysiology of HIE is now better understood, and treatment with hypothermia has become the foundation of therapy. Several neuroprotective agents offer promise when combined with hypothermia and are entering clinical trials.

### Resuscitation after birth and beyond in the neonatal intensive care unit: NRP or PALS? [^11522xmb]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Scenario 2: A term neonate born at 38 weeks' gestation is referred to a tertiary care NICU (no in-house delivery services) shortly after birth due to respiratory distress. The baby was initially breathing but soon experienced significant oxygen desaturation, bradycardia with HR < 80bpm, delayed capillary refill, and difficulty maintaining adequate respiratory efforts.

The most common etiology of respiratory distress in a term neonate shortly after birth may be due to meconium aspiration, retained fetal lung fluid, or pneumonia. NRP emphasizes gentle ventilation methods to avoid injury to the fragile neonatal lungs. In a tertiary referral center without delivery services, NRP and PALS may be used per the unit's protocol. However, PALS providers may be more aggressive in ventilation and airway management compared to the more cautious practices of NRP for neonates.

In this situation, the use of NRP would be more suitable because it is specifically designed for neonates, considering their unique physiological needs, including more delicate respiratory management and preventing further complications, such as hypoxia or hyperoxia.

Given the absence of clear evidence favoring one protocol over another in this scenario, the initial use of PALS is understandable. However, as soon as a neonatal provider is available, transitioning to NRP would ensure that the resuscitation aligns with best practices tailored to the newborn's specific physiological characteristics. Neonatal providers trained in NRP are well-equipped to manage neonates' respiratory distress and bradycardia, focusing on ventilation, oxygenation, and stabilization through neonatal-specific strategies.

While there is no definitive evidence to refute one protocol over the other, available guidelines suggest that transitioning to NRP upon the arrival of a neonatal specialist is the most appropriate approach for managing respiratory distress and bradycardia in neonates, ensuring the best outcomes for the newborn.

### Cerebral palsy characteristics in term-born children with and without detectable perinatal risk factors: a cross-sectional study [^114XuENt]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We found that participants in the CCPR born at term with 'undetectable' neonatal risk were more likely to have unilateral CP and focal injury on MRI, particularly venous stroke, than those with perinatal risk factors and/or symptoms, and they had a lower degree of impairments as measured by the GMFCS and were more likely to communicate with words. Contrary to our hypothesis, the 'undetectable' group did not have more postneonatal causes of CP.

The lack of neonatal symptoms and risk factors in the 'undetectable' group may reflect an early, antenatal timing of disruption to the central nervous system leading to CP. In this study, 28% of participants had encephalopathy or seizures, which is similar to other studies. There has been speculation that the absence of documented neonatal symptoms in some children with CP represents encephalopathy that has been 'missed' and could have benefited from interventions such as therapeutic hypothermia. Contrary to that hypothesis, the HEAL Trial has shown that subacute injuries (> 7–10 days, on the basis of the absence of diffusion restriction)can be associated with 'mild' encephalopathy, which suggests previous injury to the brain allowing for some resolution of encephalopathy before delivery. This conclusion is further supported by high rates of MRI abnormalities in infants with mild encephalopathy, and a recent study from the CCPR that found that 17% of participants with MRI patterns of hypoxia–ischemia did not have documented neonatal encephalopathy (nor postneonatal injury). Postneonatal brain injury in the CCPR includes infection, trauma, medical intervention, stroke, hypoxia (near‐drowning or near‐sudden infant death syndrome), and miscellaneous, and contrary to our hypothesis was found in approximately 9% of participants in both groups, which is similar to other studies reporting 6% to 8%. Genetic conditions are another important cause of CP that may be asymptomatic at birth, which are considered to account for 7% to 30% of CP. The characteristics of children with genetic causes of CP include those with intellectual disability, born at term, with a normal MRI, or non‐stroke MRI abnormalities. Children without detectable risk factors have a higher prevalence of genetic causes for their CP.

### Characteristics of children with cerebral palsy in the post-therapeutic hypothermia era [^117EA2aT]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, caused by an intrapartum event leading to perinatal asphyxia, is the most frequent and well-studied cause of neonatal encephalopathy. It is associated with later neurologic morbidities, including cerebral palsy, seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral challenges. Therapeutic hypothermia, initiated within 6 hours of birth and continued for 72 hours, has been established as a safe and effective therapy for neonates born at greater than 35 weeks of gestational age, who present with clinical evidence of moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy. ‐ It has been shown to decrease mortality or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disability at 18–24 months of age, with a number needed to treat of 6 to 7. Therapeutic hypothermia has also been shown to improve neurocognitive outcomes at school age. At our institution, therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in 2008 with a specific referral and treatment algorithm shared with regional birthing centers.

In the acute neonatal period, outcomes of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are often difficult to predict. Clinicians need to know what available information can be used to better counsel parents on long-term prognosis. The literature on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, therapeutic hypothermia, and cerebral palsy is extensive. However, there are some gaps in the literature in terms of examining the profile of children with cerebral palsy who received therapeutic hypothermia after intrapartum asphyxia (IAP), both in terms of neonatal factors and long-term cerebral palsy outcomes.

In addition, parents of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy will often ask concrete functional questions about long-term prognosis including: Will my child be able to walk? Will my child be able to speak and communicate with me? Will my child be feeding independently? These functional questions have a direct bearing on caregiver burden and eventual autonomy.

Our primary objective was to explore the profile of children with cerebral palsy secondary to intrapartum asphyxia who were treated with therapeutic hypothermia at a single regional tertiary center. Specifically, we set out to look at their clinical characteristics in the neonatal period and their cerebral palsy profiles as children. In addition, we compared this profile with the profile of children with cerebral palsy prior to therapeutic hypothermia to see if there had been any shift in the pattern of later cerebral palsy with the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. Finally, we compared the neonatal characteristics (including birth characteristics, cord pH, Apgar scores, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings) between children with an eventual mild cerebral palsy phenotype and those with a more severe phenotype ultimately.

### Cooling for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy [^113Pa8hj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Newborn animal studies and pilot studies in humans suggest that mild hypothermia following peripartum hypoxia-ischaemia in newborn infants may reduce neurological sequelae without adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the effect of therapeutic hypothermia in encephalopathic asphyxiated newborn infants on mortality, long-term neurodevelopmental disability and clinically important side effects.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007). Randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic hypothermia in term and late preterm newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy were identified by searching the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007), previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching. We updated this search in May 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing the use of therapeutic hypothermia with standard care in encephalopathic term or late preterm infants with evidence of peripartum asphyxia and without recognisable major congenital anomalies. The primary outcome measure was death or long-term major neurodevelopmental disability. Other outcomes included adverse effects of cooling and 'early' indicators of neurodevelopmental outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of and extracted data from the included studies. Study authors were contacted for further information. Meta-analyses were performed using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials in this updated review, comprising 1505 term and late preterm infants with moderate/severe encephalopathy and evidence of intrapartum asphyxia. Therapeutic hypothermia resulted in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in the combined outcome of mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability to 18 months of age (typical RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.83); typical RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.10); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) (8 studies, 1344 infants). Cooling also resulted in statistically significant reductions in mortality (typical RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.88), typical RD -0.09 (95% CI -0.13 to -0.04); NNTB 11 (95% CI 8 to 25) (11 studies, 1468 infants) and in neurodevelopmental disability in survivors (typical RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.94), typical RD -0.13 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.07); NNTB 8 (95% CI 5 to 14) (8 studies, 917 infants). Some adverse effects of hypothermia included an increase sinus bradycardia and a significant increase in thrombocytopenia.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from the 11 randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review (N = 1505 infants) that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial in term and late preterm newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Cooling reduces mortality without increasing major disability in survivors. The benefits of cooling on survival and neurodevelopment outweigh the short-term adverse effects. Hypothermia should be instituted in term and late preterm infants with moderate-to-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy if identified before six hours of age. Further trials to determine the appropriate techniques of cooling, including refinement of patient selection, duration of cooling and method of providing therapeutic hypothermia, will refine our understanding of this intervention.

### Early determination of prognosis in neonatal moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^115Wk1rD]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Early determination of prognosis is important in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our objective was to test scoring systems developed earlier (original scoring system) and develop new prognostic models.

Methods

Secondary analysis of data from the multicenter randomized controlled trial of longer, deeper, or usual care cooling in neonatal HIE (NCT01192776) that enrolled 364 neonates diagnosed with moderate or severe HIE. The primary outcome was death or moderate or severe disability at 18 to 22 months, and secondary outcome was death during initial hospitalization. Testing of early neurologic clinical examination (< 6 hours of age) and the original scoring system for prognostic ability was done, followed by development of new scoring systems and classification and regression tree (CART) models by using early clinical variables (< 6 hours of age).

Results

For death or disability, the original scoring system correctly classified 75% (95% confidence interval: 69%-81%), whereas the new scoring system correctly classified 78% (73%-82%), and the CART model correctly classified 76% (72%-81%). Early neurologic clinical examination also had a correct classification rate of 76% (71%-80%). Depth and duration of cooling did not affect prediction. Only a few components of the early neurologic examination were associated with poor outcome. For death, the original scoring system correctly classified 72% (66%-77%), the new scoring system 68% (63%-72%), the new CART model 87% (83%-90%), and early neurologic evaluation 81% (77%-85%).

Conclusions

The 3 models (scoring system, CART, and early neurologic evaluation) were comparable in predicting death or disability. For in-hospital death, CART models were superior to scoring systems and early neurologic examination.

### Aspects on oxygenation in preterm infants before, immediately after birth, and beyond [^115FwwTe]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Importance of Oxygen Levels before Birth

Lack of appropriate oxygen levels during intrauterine life can precipitate serious harm. For example, profound maternal hypoxemia is indelibly linked to fetal neurological injury. The sensitive subventricular and pallidum zones, for example, rapidly undergo apoptosis, structural and functional changes during hypoxemia. In utero inflammation may also increase susceptibility to hyperoxia after birth. Animal studies suggest that some level of inflammation may be protective and promote organ maturation but inflammation can also precipitate organ injury particularly within the placenta, brain, and lungs.

A stable hypoxic environment (PaO 2 20–30 mm Hg) is important for normal lung development during the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages. This process is driven by a group of transcription factors including the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) which control > 100 genes governing the regulation of cellular metabolism, proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, and survival. The human HIF system is mature by 8 weeks gestation and high levels of HIF mRNA and protein are detected in the fetal lungs, where HIF-1α protein expression in all cell types is induced by hypoxia. HIF-2α protein, on the other hand, is expressed only in vascular endothelium and type II pneumocytes.

Genetic studies illustrate the importance of the HIF system. Homozygous deletions of HIF-1α and HIF-1β are fatal in mice by embryonic day 10, with severe cardiovascular malformations being the most common cause of death. HIF-2α gene deletion results in death of 50% of fetuses while survivors have abnormally developed lungs with reduced surfactant production, postnatal respiratory distress, and early death.

### Immediate versus deferred delivery of the preterm baby with suspected fetal compromise for improving outcomes [^111GxQe8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Immediate delivery of the preterm fetus with suspected compromise may decrease the risk of damage due to intrauterine hypoxia. However, it may also increase the risks of prematurity.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immediate versus deferred delivery of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a policy of immediate delivery with deferred delivery or expectant management in preterm fetuses with suspected in utero compromise. Quasi-randomised trials and trials employing a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included one trial of 548 women (588 babies) in the review. Women with pregnancies between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation took part. The study took place in 13 European countries, between 1993 and 2001. The difference in the median randomisation to delivery interval between immediate delivery and deferred delivery was four days (median: 0.9 (inter-quartile range (IQR) 0.4 to 1.3) days for immediate delivery, median: 4.9 (IQR 2.0 to 10.8) days in the delay group). There was no clear difference in the primary outcomes of extended perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 2.04, one trial, 587 babies, moderate-quality evidence) or the composite outcome of death or disability at or after two years of age (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75, one trial, 573 babies, moderate-quality evidence) with immediate delivery compared to deferred delivery. The results for these outcomes are consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. More babies in the immediate delivery group were ventilated for more than 24 hours (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97, one trial, 576 babies). There were no differences between the immediate delivery and deferred delivery groups in any other infant mortality outcome (stillbirth, neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality > 28 days to discharge), individual neonatal morbidity or markers of neonatal morbidity (cord pH less than 7.00, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, convulsions, interventricular haemorrhage or germinal matrix haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and periventricular leucomalacia or ventriculomegaly). Some important outcomes were not reported, in particular infant admission to neonatal intensive care or special care facility, and respiratory distress syndrome. We were not able to calculate composite rates of serious neonatal morbidity, even though individual morbidities were reported, due to the risk of double counting infants with more than one morbidity. More children in the immediate delivery group had cerebral palsy at or after two years of age (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02, one trial, 507 children). There were, however, no differences in neurodevelopment impairment at or after two years (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.41, one trial, 507 children), death at or after two years of age (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63, one trial, 573 children), or death or disability in childhood (six to 13 years of age) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.40, one trial, 302 children). More women in the immediate delivery group had caesarean delivery than in the deferred delivery group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24, one trial, 547 women, high-quality evidence). Data were not available on any other maternal outcomes. There were several methodological weaknesses in the included study, and the level of evidence for the primary outcomes was graded high for caesarean section and moderate for extended perinatal mortality and death or disability at or after two years. The evidence was downgraded because the CIs for these outcomes were wide, and were consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. Bias may have been introduced by several factors: blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, data for childhood follow-up were incomplete due to attrition, and no adjustment was made in the analysis for the non-independence of babies from multiple pregnancies (39 out of 548 pregnancies). This study only included cases of suspected fetal compromise where there was uncertainty whether immediate delivery was indicated, thus results must be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of immediate delivery compared with deferred delivery in cases of suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to make firm recommendations. There is a lack of trials addressing this question, and limitations of the one included trial means that caution must be used in interpreting and generalising the findings. More research is needed to guide clinical practice. Although the included trial is relatively large, it has insufficient power to detect differences in neonatal mortality. It did not report any maternal outcomes other than mode of delivery, or evaluate maternal satisfaction or economic outcomes. The applicability of the findings is limited by several factors: Women with a wide range of obstetric complications and gestational ages were included, and subgroup analysis is currently limited. Advances in Doppler assessment techniques may diagnose severe compromise more accurately and help make decisions about the timing of delivery. The potential benefits of deferring delivery for longer or shorter periods cannot be presumed. Where there is uncertainty whether or not to deliver a preterm fetus with suspected fetal compromise, there seems to be no benefit to immediate delivery. Deferring delivery until test results worsen or increasing gestation favours delivery may improve the outcomes for mother and baby. There is a need for high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing immediate and deferred delivery where there is suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to guide clinical practice. Future trials should report all important outcomes, and should be adequately powered to detect differences in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

### Optimum oxygen therapy in preterm babies [^114oR7kT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Oxygen is the most commonly used therapy in neonatal nurseries as an integral part of respiratory support. The goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissue without creating oxygen toxicity. Oxygen must have been given to newborn preterm babies more than any other medicinal product in the past 60 years. Despite this, we still know very little about how much oxygen these babies actually need, or how much oxygen is safe to give, especially in the first few weeks of life. Recent observational studies have raised concerns that giving oxygen to target the saturation at "physiological" levels in newborn preterm babies may do more harm than good, but to date, clinicians have not been able to resolve the uncertainties surrounding optimum oxygen therapy.

### Targeted neonatal echocardiography in the neonatal intensive care unit: practice guidelines and recommendations for training. writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) in collaboration with the European association of echocardiography (EAE) and the association for European pediatric cardiologists (AEPC) [^114xk1z3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Perinatal asphyxia — definition, prevalence, imaging approach, and recommendations: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is defined by persistent low Apgar scores (0–3) for > 5 min and profound metabolic or mixed acidosis (pH < 7.0) on an umbilical cord blood gas, with an estimated incidence of 0.5% to 2% of live births and birth asphyxia causing 23% of all neonatal deaths worldwide. TNE may be useful, as data suggest that approximately 30% to 50% of infants with perinatal asphyxia exhibit echocardiographic evidence of ventricular dysfunction; all neonates with clinical evidence of asphyxia should be evaluated for myocardial injury using hemodynamic assessment and biomarkers, and if there is no clinical evidence of cardiovascular compromise and no elevation of biomarkers, echocardiography is unlikely to be useful. The initial study should be a comprehensive study, and early (< 6 hours of life) mild to moderate hypothermia improves survival without disability in moderately to severely asphyxiated infants; comprehensive echocardiography is indicated in neonates with perinatal asphyxia with clinical or biochemical signs of cardiovascular compromise, standard TNE can help in optimizing therapy, and the role of TNE in monitoring the cooling and rewarming phases of hypothermia needs further investigation.

### NeOProM: neonatal oxygenation prospective meta-analysis collaboration study protocol [^115K8JcY]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Less exposure to oxygen is a simple strategy that could reduce oxidative stress and tissue injury and prevent morbidity in very preterm infants. In healthy preterm infants breathing air, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2) is 85–98%. However, for infants requiring supplemental oxygen, the optimum range of arterial oxygen to minimise organ damage, without causing hypoxic injury, remains unknown.

Summary of existing evidence

The first case of ROP was reported in 1942. By 1954, ROP had blinded about 10,000 infants. In 1954–56, three randomised trials, enrolling 341 infants, proved that breathing unrestricted concentrations of inspired oxygen was a major cause of ROP. As arterial oxygen levels were not able to be measured, the concentration of inspired oxygen could not be targeted to meet each baby's needs. Following these findings, premature infants were restricted to breathing less than 40% inspired oxygen in order to prevent ROP. In the next 20 years over 150,000 premature babies died of hypoxic respiratory failure. It is estimated that for every infant whose sight was saved, 16 died and many others developed spastic diplegia.

The Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold Retinopathy of Prematurity (STOP ROP) trial used pulse oximetry to target lower (89–94%) or higher (96–99%) SpO 2 in 649 preterm infants with pre-threshold ROP. The higher range caused more adverse respiratory events, including pneumonia, chronic lung disease requiring oxygen and diuretic therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of progression to threshold ROP. In the Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST) trial, 358 infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned, from 3 weeks or more after birth until they breathed air, to target a SpO 2 range of either 91–94% or 95–98%. This trial found no evidence that higher SpO 2 targeting improved growth or development, but it did increase days of oxygen therapy and use of health care resources. Masked, adjusted oximeters were used in this trial so that some were adjusted to display masked values 2% lower than actual SpO 2, and others displayed masked values 2% higher. Staff were unaware of actual SpO 2 and targeted a masked range of 93–96%. The authors concluded that further large randomised trials were needed to determine how targeting different SpO 2 levels from the day of birth affects ROP, chronic lung disease, growth, disability and mortality.

### Neonatal hypoxia and seizures… [^115YTptg]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

With 1 to 3 in 1, 000 term neonates experiencing seizures, pediatricians need to know how to determine the seizure cause and manage appropriately, using brain imaging and treatments such as therapeutic hypothermia, xenon, and other pharmacologic therapies, in order to minimize long-term sequelae and leverage the infant brain's tremendous capacity for repair in the first 2 years after birth. After completing this article, readers should be able to: Seizures occur during the newborn period at an incidence of ∼1 to 3 per 1, 000 infants born at term. Numerous systemic and neurologic conditions can manifest as seizures. Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, defined as partial lack of oxygen resulting in reduction of blood flow to the brain, is the most frequent cause of seizures in the newborn period. It is important to determine the cause of neonatal seizures and institute the appropriate therapy to minimize the long-term sequelae of both the underlying condition. Comments

### Neonatal hypoxia ischemia and individual differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes… [^111zn19W]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

803. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.0537 To the Editor Finder et al1 demonstrate that cognitive scores of children with a history of mild hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were lower than contemporaneous control children and not different from survivors of moderate HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia. 1 The authors mention that neuroprotective treatments, such as therapeutic hypothermia, are often not offered to infants with mild HIE because of a perceived good prognosis, a concern that we share. We have shown2 that even among healthy preschool children, a history of variations in oxygenation levels at birth is associated with poorer cognitive flexibility.

Moreover, we demonstrated that there are genetic individual differences in the susceptibility to the damaging effects of birth hypoxia on cognition, in which a polygenic risk score reflecting variations in the function of the dopamine transporter gene gene network in the prefrontal cortex predicts both impaired cognitive flexibility and lower gray-matter density. in those affected by hypoxia. 2 In the era of precision medicine, there is a need for controlled studies evaluating the potential effect of innovative genomic measures in contributing for the identification of children at high risk for long-term impaired executive functions when facing HIE and who will potentially benefit from early interventions such as therapeutic hypothermia.

### Further studies on the effects of hypoxia on the respiration of newborn infants… [^1138dPE5]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The response to breathing 12 per cent oxygen by newborn premature and full-term infants and premature infants several weeks old has been studied. Comparisons show that newborn premature and full-term infants during the first days after birth failed to respond with increases in respiratory rate or tidal volume during the hypoxic state. In fact, there was some decrease in ventilation which was largely related to reductions in tidal volume. Premature infants several weeks old, on the other hand, showed an immediate and significant hyperpnea while breathing 12 per cent oxygen. The younger infants, particularly the premature infants, seemed to be less disturbed by the hypoxia than older infants. These results substantiated previous results obtained on full-term infants. The hypothesis was advanced that the chemoreceptor reflexes were less active immediately following birth than later on in life. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments

### The effects of hypoxia on the respiration of newborn infants… [^112VzDCf]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The effects of administering atmospheres containing 10 and 12% oxygen to healthy newborn infants of different ages have been studied. Infants under 24 hours of age tended to hypoventilate throughout the period of hypoxia. Infants six to 11 days of age hyperventilated for the first two or three minutes and then showed a decrease, although not so marked as observed in the infants under 24 hours of age. Infants 16 to 48 days of age showed the most marked increase in ventilation, but even in these infants it was poorly maintained as compared to responses seen in adults. Hypoxia produced a slowing of the respiratory rate in all infants except the very oldest. Tidal air was increased at first and then decreased. The increases in tidal air accounted for most of the increase in minute volume seen in the older infants. Hypoxia increased the incidence of periodic breathing in the two older groups of infants, but had very little effect on infants under 24 hours of age.

Respiratory patterns did not appear to be altered by the hypoxic conditions employed in this study. It has been postulated that the comparatively weak response to hypoxia made by infants immediately after birth possibly is dependent on relatively poor chemoreceptor reflexes and that the latter increase in strength during the first weeks of postnatal life. It has also been suggested that the relative inability to induce periodic breathing in infants under 24 hours of age as compared to those several weeks old is further evidence indicating that metabolism of the medullary respiratory centers is to a larger extent anerobic than at the later periods of postnatal life.

### Intermittent hypoxemia in preterm infants: etiology and clinical relevance… [^1156eShY]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

Intermittent hypoxemia, episodic drops in hemoglobin oxygen saturation, is a common problem in preterm infants. The extent of IH is not apparent clinically because accurately documenting cardiorespiratory events for day-to-day patient care management is challenging. Multiple factors place preterm infants at high risk for increased IH. These factors include respiratory immaturity, lung disease, and anemia. Brief episodes of oxygen desaturation may seem clinically insignificant; however, these events may have a cumulative effect on neonatal outcomes. There is mounting evidence from both animal models and clinical studies suggesting that IH is associated with injury and poor outcomes such as increased inflammation, impaired growth, retinopathy of prematurity, and neurodevelopmental impairment. In this article, the author reviews the etiology and consequences of IH in preterm infants. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments
