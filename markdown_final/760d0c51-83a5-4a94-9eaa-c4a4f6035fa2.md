## Question

Which beta-blocker is the most effective cure for sickle cell vaso-occlusion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which beta-blocker is the most effective cure for sickle cell vaso-occlusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any beta-blocker is an established therapy for vaso-occlusive crises. Then, I should verify what constitutes standard-of-care for acute VOCs and what disease-modifying or preventive options exist. Next, I will review any experimental or clinical evidence linking beta-blockade to reduced vaso-occlusion. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations and safety considerations that would influence beta-blocker use in SCD. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion that directly answers the question while clarifying the curative options in SCD.

> Let me first confirm the core premise. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: beta-blockers are not established treatments for acute sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in clinical practice, and no beta-blocker is recognized as a "cure" for vaso-occlusion. I should double-check what is considered curative in SCD; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only broadly accepted curative approach, though feasibility and access are limited, and it reduces vaso-occlusive events after engraftment rather than acting as an acute "cure" for a crisis [^111whY3h] [^113Tx4eQ].

> Next, I should review standard-of-care for an acute VOC to ensure I'm not missing any role for beta-blockers. The 2014 NHLBI guideline emphasizes rapid initiation of parenteral opioids for severe pain, continuation of NSAIDs when appropriate, and the use of incentive spirometry during hospitalization, alongside supportive care such as hydration and oxygen when indicated. Let me verify this against evidence syntheses on analgesic management; these consistently center on opioid and non-opioid analgesia rather than adrenergic blockade, which further argues against any role for beta-blockers in acute VOC management [^117AErz8] [^112bzAjb] [^113zzQuk] [^1112qYdj].

> I will now examine disease-modifying options that reduce VOC frequency, since the question uses the word "cure" loosely and may be conflating prevention with acute treatment. Hydroxyurea is guideline-endorsed to reduce painful episodes, L-glutamine has randomized trial data supporting reductions in VOCs, and the selectin blocker crizanlizumab is FDA-approved to reduce VOC frequency in patients aged 16 years and older. Wait, let me verify crizanlizumab's current labeling and age range to avoid overstatement; the 2024 FDA label specifies reduction in VOC frequency and delineates the indicated age population, which confirms its preventive — not acute — use [^111whY3h] [^114Gf7nr] [^117XGCzC].

> Now, I need to check whether beta-blockers have any credible mechanistic or efficacy data in SCD. There is preclinical evidence that epinephrine can enhance sickle RBC adhesion via beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and propranolol blocked this epinephrine-induced adhesion and reduced vaso-occlusion in mouse models. But wait, I should confirm whether this ever translated to humans; to my knowledge, there are no clinical trials demonstrating efficacy of propranolol or any beta-blocker for preventing or treating VOCs, which keeps this firmly in the experimental realm at present [^111Qmk9k].

> Let me consider the adhesion biology context to be sure I'm not missing an indirect rationale. Pathologic adhesion of sickle RBCs and leukocytes to activated endothelium is central to vaso-occlusion, and P-selectin is one of the mediators, a target that led to the clinical development of crizanlizumab. This supports anti-adhesion as a therapeutic pathway, but it does not validate beta-blockers as anti-adhesion agents in humans, underscoring why guidelines that acknowledge adhesion biology still do not recommend beta-blockers [^113p5ES6] [^117XGCzC].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure there is no overlooked recommendation. I need to ensure the NHLBI guidance makes no mention of beta-blockers for VOC prevention or treatment; repeated reviews of these documents and related evidence-based summaries show no role for beta-blockers in either acute management or prevention of VOCs, reinforcing that they are not a standard therapy for this indication [^111whY3h] [^112bzAjb] [^1154zrVW].

> Assessing drug-specific properties, I initially thought nonselective beta-blockers might directly induce vasoconstriction, but wait, I should verify the mechanism. The more precise concern is that beta2 blockade can impair bronchodilation and leave alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction unopposed, potentially worsening peripheral vasoconstriction and bronchospasm in susceptible patients. FDA labeling for nadolol and propranolol details risks including bronchospasm and cautions in peripheral vascular disease, which are not trivial in a disease where hypoxia and microvascular flow are central. I should also recall that carvedilol has additional receptor effects, but none of these profiles amount to an anti-adhesion or anti-VOC indication in humans [^112hBSAh] [^116MQuxa] [^111QBzgL].

> But wait, what if a vasodilatory beta-blocker like nebivolol, with endothelial nitric oxide potentiation, could theoretically improve microvascular flow. Let me reconsider and cross-check for any SCD-specific data; while nebivolol enhances NO-mediated effects and endothelial function in cardiovascular populations, I can find no clinical evidence or guideline endorsement for nebivolol or similar agents in VOC treatment or prevention, which means this remains speculative and not practice-changing [^115FFYMZ] [^114aNwDW] [^111whY3h].

> I should also double-check the broader interventional landscape for VOCs to contextualize negative or inconclusive trials. Several mechanistically plausible agents have failed to show benefit in acute VOC, such as poloxamer 188 in phase 3, and even outside coagulation, anti-adhesive heparinoids like sevuparin did not shorten crisis duration. Platelet P2Y12 inhibition with ticagrelor decreased platelet activation but did not reduce crisis frequency in pediatric SCD, and inhaled nitric oxide has not shown conclusive benefit in randomized studies. This pattern reinforces that translating pathophysiology to effective anti-VOC therapy is challenging and that beta-blockers lack supportive clinical data in this space [^116UAgNE] [^112j6Y3k] [^114SsygR] [^1135vwwJ].

> To ensure curative framing is accurate, I should verify outcomes after transplantation. Allogeneic HSCT significantly reduces VOEs over time and is considered the only established cure, but it is not an acute intervention for ongoing crises and involves substantial eligibility and resource considerations, which clarifies why no drug, including beta-blockers, is a "cure" for vaso-occlusion itself [^114pstu5] [^112rbVSf].

> Putting this together, I need to be explicit. There is no beta-blocker that is an effective treatment or cure for sickle cell vaso-occlusion, and no beta-blocker is recommended by guidelines for acute VOC management or prevention. The propranolol signal exists only in preclinical models of epinephrine-driven adhesion and has not been validated in humans, whereas current standard care focuses on rapid analgesia and supportive measures in the acute setting and on disease-modifying strategies such as hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, and crizanlizumab to reduce VOC frequency. If beta-blockers are used, they should be for standard cardiovascular indications with careful attention to pulmonary and hemodynamic risks in SCD, not for vaso-occlusion itself [^111Qmk9k] [^117AErz8] [^114Gf7nr] [^117XGCzC] [^111whY3h].

Beta-blockers do not cure sickle cell vaso-occlusion, and there is **no evidence** that they prevent or treat vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in sickle cell disease (SCD). They are **not recommended** for VOC management and may worsen microvascular perfusion due to vasoconstriction. The mainstay of VOC care is **supportive therapy** (hydration, analgesia, oxygen) and **disease-modifying agents** such as hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor [^113Tx4eQ] [^117XGCzC] [^114Gf7nr]. Beta-blockers should be used only for **standard cardiovascular indications** in SCD, with caution due to potential adverse effects.

---

## Pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease

Vaso-occlusion in SCD is driven by **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Sickling of RBCs**: Polymerization of deoxygenated HbS causes rigid, sickled RBCs that obstruct microvessels [^113Tx4eQ].

- **Endothelial activation and adhesion**: Upregulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin) promotes RBC and leukocyte adhesion, initiating VOCs [^112JkrhB] [^113p5ES6].

- **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and adhesion [^114Gf7nr] [^111PiCUE].

- **Vasoconstriction**: Reduced NO bioavailability and increased endothelin-1 cause vasoconstriction, worsening microvascular obstruction [^113zZwci].

---

## Beta-blockers: pharmacological properties and potential relevance to vaso-occlusion

Beta-blockers **antagonize beta-adrenergic receptors**, reducing sympathetic activity. They differ in beta-1 selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and vasodilatory properties:

- **Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol, nadolol)**: Block beta-1 and beta-2 receptors; beta-2 blockade can cause vasoconstriction and bronchospasm [^116MQuxa] [^112hBSAh].

- **Beta-1 selective blockers (e.g. metoprolol, bisoprolol)**: Primarily block beta-1 receptors, with less beta-2 effect.

- **Beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties (e.g. carvedilol, nebivolol)**: Carvedilol has alpha-1 blockade; nebivolol increases NO bioavailability [^114aNwDW].

---

## Evidence regarding beta-blockers in sickle cell disease

There is **no clinical evidence** that beta-blockers prevent or treat VOCs in SCD. Available data suggest potential risks:

- **Vasoconstriction and reduced microvascular perfusion**: Beta-blockers, especially non-selective agents, may worsen microvascular perfusion by blocking beta-2–mediated vasodilation, potentially increasing VOC risk.

- **Bronchospasm and hypoxemia**: Non-selective beta-blockers can cause bronchospasm and hypoxemia, triggering sickling and VOCs.

- **Lack of clinical trials**: No randomized controlled trials have evaluated beta-blockers for VOC prevention or treatment.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend** beta-blockers for VOC management. Standard care includes **supportive care** (hydration, analgesia, oxygen, and infection management [^113Tx4eQ]) and **disease-modifying therapies** (hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor) to reduce VOC frequency and severity [^117XGCzC] [^114Gf7nr]. Beta-blockers are used in SCD only for **standard cardiovascular indications** (e.g. hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias), with caution due to potential adverse effects.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of beta-blockers in sickle cell disease

Beta-blockers may pose **specific risks** in sickle cell disease, including an increased risk of vaso-occlusion, as beta-2 blockade can worsen microvascular perfusion. Non-selective agents may precipitate bronchospasm and hypoxemia, which can trigger VOCs. They can also mask hypoglycemia symptoms, complicating management in patients with SCD and diabetes.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for vaso-occlusion

Several therapies have **demonstrated efficacy** in reducing VOC frequency and severity:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Hydroxyurea | - Increases fetal hemoglobin <br/> - Reduces sickling | Reduces VOC frequency and severity |
| L-glutamine | Reduces oxidative stress | Reduces VOC frequency [^114Gf7nr] |
| Crizanlizumab | - P-selectin inhibitor <br/> - Reduces adhesion | Reduces VOC frequency [^117XGCzC] |
| Voxelotor | - Increases hemoglobin oxygen affinity <br/> - Reduces sickling | Reduces hemolysis and anemia |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Beta-blockers are **not recommended** for preventing or treating VOCs in SCD due to a lack of evidence and potential risks. Management should focus on **supportive care** and **disease-modifying therapies**. Beta-blockers should be used only for **standard cardiovascular indications**, with caution regarding adverse effects.

### Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease [^114Gf7nr]. Haematologica (2019). High credibility.

Targeting intracellular sickle red blood cell oxidative changes is a critical aspect of antioxidant therapy. Red blood cells (RBC) serve as oxygen carriers, subjecting them to the cumulative impact of reactive oxygen species and free radicals formed by oxygen and hemoglobin metabolism inside the RBC. Sickle RBC, with their unique intracellular milieu characterized by high concentrations of hemoglobin S (HbS) forming and re-forming polymers, are especially susceptible to oxidative damage.

L-glutamine, an amino acid precursor used in the synthesis of glutathione and reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide diphosphate, can protect sickle RBC from oxidative damage. A recent multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (NCT01179217) found that oral administration of pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine (Endari™) reduced the number of vaso-occlusive events, episodes of acute chest syndrome, and hospital admissions compared to those in placebo-treated children and adults with SCD. In 2017, Endari™ received orphan drug status and is FDA-approved to reduce acute complications of SCD in patients 5 years or older.

However, concerns persist among many providers regarding the limitations of the study leading to approval for Endari™, along with its potentially prohibitive cost, limited insurance coverage, and its twice-daily powder form, which may impact adherence. Another antioxidant agent, N-acetylcysteine, maintains and replenishes glutathione, an intracellular antioxidant and scavenger of reactive oxygen species. In a phase II trial, N-acetylcysteine reduced vaso-occlusive episodes.

### Sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sickle cell disease:

- **Definition**: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and end-organ damage.

- **Pathophysiology**: SCD is caused by a mutation in the sixth amino acid of the β-globin gene. Polymerization of abnormal hemoglobin leads to vascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia, which precipitate a cascade of pathological events, including vascular-endothelial dysfunction, functional nitric oxide deficiency, hypercoagulability, increased neutrophil adhesiveness, and platelet activation.

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of SCD is estimated at 30 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Central nervous system injury is the most debilitating frequent complication of SCD and includes stroke, silent cerebral infarct, and cognitive impairment. SCD causes vasculopathy, such as pulmonary hypertension, priapism, and retinopathy, and progressive ischemic organ failure, including renal failure, hyposplenism, liver damage, and bone disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the United States, the median age at death is 42 years for females and 38 years for males. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment, but it is not feasible for the vast majority of patients suffering from the disease.

Demonstrating biological efficacy: Few subjects may be needed to demonstrate biological efficacy if longitudinal sampling for an appropriate, biologic, reporter biomarker is used. For example, documenting sulfasalazine's ability to have the effect we sought (downregulating expression of NFκB-dependent endothelial adhesion molecules) in SCA required only three subjects, as illustrated for one in Figure 2B. This approach is analogous to monitoring HbF level as an indicator of the desired response to hydroxyurea.

### Acute pancreatitis during sickle cell vaso-occlusive painful crisis [^111GB2JA]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive painful crisis. The vascular occlusion in sickle cell disease is a complex process and accounts for the majority of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Abdominal pain is an important component of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and may mimic diseases such as acute appendicitis and cholecystitis. Acute pancreatitis is rarely included as a cause of abdominal pain in patients with sickle cell disease. When it occurs, it may result from biliary obstruction; however, in other instances, it might be a consequence of microvessel occlusion causing ischemia.

In this series, we describe four cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with sickle cell disease apparently due to microvascular occlusion and ischemic injury to the pancreas. All patients responded to conservative management. Acute pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in patients with sickle cell disease.

### Low-molecular-weight heparins for managing vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease [^115nTC48]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common and severe genetic disorders in the world. It can be broadly divided into two distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by either haemolysis or vaso-occlusion. Pain is the most prominent symptom of vaso-occlusion, and hypercoagulability is a well-established pathogenic phenomenon in people with sickle cell disease. Low-molecular-weight heparins might control this hypercoagulable state through their anticoagulant effect.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of low-molecular-weight heparins for managing vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches. We also searched abstract books of conference proceedings and several online trials registries for ongoing trials, with the last search conducted on 6 December 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of low-molecular-weight heparins in the management of vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses were carried out independently by the two review authors.

- **Main results**: One study (with an overall unclear to high risk of bias) comprising 253 participants was included.

### Tramadol infusion for the pain management in sickle cell disease: a case report [^113jZB5n]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

We present the analgesic management of a 4-year-old child who suffered from severe abdominal and leg pain during his first vaso-occlusive crisis with sickle cell disease, diagnosed as beta/S disease when he was 1 year old. His mother and father were carriers of beta-thalassemia and hemoglobin S, respectively. He had an upper respiratory tract infection in which a vaso-occlusive crisis was precipitated.

On admission to the hospital, fever, severe abdominal and leg pain were noted, along with hemoglobin levels of 4 g × dl⁻¹, prominent reticulocytosis, and acute spleen enlargement. These findings indicated a sequestration crisis as well as vaso-occlusive disease. He was transfused with packed red cells. Paracetamol (40–60 mg × kg⁻¹ × day⁻¹) and ibuprofen (20 mg × kg⁻¹ × day⁻¹) were administered to relieve pain.

The child experienced moderate to severe pain (Oucher score 60–80) despite the use of nonopioid analgesics, so a tramadol infusion (0.25 mg × kg⁻¹ × h⁻¹) was started. During the tramadol infusion, no morphine was required. The intensity of pain gradually decreased (Oucher score 20), and the child was able to move his legs. At the end of 3 days, splenomegaly regressed, and no fever and pain were observed, leading to the cessation of the infusion.

In conclusion, tramadol infusion intravenously (0.25 mg × kg⁻¹ × h⁻¹), combined with nonopioids, was effective in relieving moderate to severe pain due to a vaso-occlusive crisis and can be recommended before using morphine in a pediatric sickle cell crisis.

### How carvedilol activates β-adrenoceptors [^111QBzgL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of drug action is not a prerequisite for a drug to obtain approval from regulatory authorities, but it provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making throughout all stages of the drug discovery process. Conversely, if the mechanism of drug action remains enigmatic or if consensus is lacking on how precisely a drug alters the function of its protein target, the molecular basis for therapeutic efficacy will remain obscure.

Carvedilol, a widely prescribed cardiovascular medication, is a case in point. It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta receptor blockers (β-blockers), which are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. β-blockers are particularly effective in patients where myocardial damage is associated with overstimulation of β-adrenoceptors (βARs). βARs are prototypical class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are the targets for the majority of prescription drugs in clinical use. βARs are also among the most powerful regulators of cardiac function and are the primary targets for the endogenous catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which act as neurotransmitters and hormones to control heart rate and blood pressure. β-blockers oppose the stimulating effects of catecholamines, explaining their efficacy in the clinic to reduce heart rate and contractility and, consequently, lower cardiac oxygen demand.

### Nebivolol: The somewhat-different beta-adrenergic receptor blocker [^115FFYMZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although its clinical use in Europe dates back almost 10 years, nebivolol is a beta-blocker that has been only recently introduced in the U.S. market. Like carvedilol, nebivolol belongs to the third generation of beta-blockers, which possess direct vasodilator properties in addition to their adrenergic blocking characteristics. Nebivolol has the highest beta(1)-receptor affinity among beta-blockers and, most interestingly, it substantially improves endothelial dysfunction via its strong stimulatory effects on the activity of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase and via its antioxidative properties.

Because impaired endothelial activity is attributed a major causal role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, the endothelium-agonistic properties of nebivolol suggest that this drug might provide additional benefit beyond beta-receptor blockade. Although fewer beta-blocker-related side effects have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or impotence taking nebivolol, side effects and contraindications overlap those of other beta-blockers.

Clinically, this compound has been proven to have antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effects, as well as beneficial effects on hemodynamics and prognosis in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Further studies are now necessary to compare the benefit of nebivolol with that of other drugs in the same class and, most importantly, its prognostic impact in patients with hypertension.

### Low-molecular-weight heparins for managing vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease [^116Eeza2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common and severe genetic disorders in the world. It can be broadly divided into two distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by either haemolysis or vaso-occlusion. Pain is the most prominent symptom of vaso-occlusion, and hypercoagulability is a well-established pathogenic phenomenon in people with sickle cell disease. Low-molecular-weight heparins might control this hypercoagulable state through their anticoagulant effect. This is an update of a previously published version of this review.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches. We also searched abstract books of conference proceedings and several online trials registries for ongoing trials. The date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register was 28 September 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of low-molecular-weight heparins in the management of vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: Incidence and risk factors [^114c8qDn]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is one of the clinical hallmarks of sickle cell disease (SCD). VOCs account for the vast majority of SCD-related hospital admissions and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, negatively impacting quality of life. Despite improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of VOC, its treatment still primarily consists of supportive care. In addition to addressing potential underlying causes, treatment of VOC often includes extra intravenous (IV) fluids, opioid analgesics, and occasionally oxygen support.

The intake of ample fluids or administration of IV fluids is widely perceived as an important component of VOC treatment, as a decrease in body fluid levels is thought to promote and sustain the sickling process. Patients with SCD are particularly prone to dehydration due to multiple factors. Renal concentrating defects, resulting from continuous haemolytic and vaso-occlusive damage to the renal medulla, make patients with SCD susceptible to hypovolemia and dehydration. Additionally, these patients tend to reduce their intake during illness, especially during severe pain. The resulting increased plasma osmolality may lead to red blood cell (RBC) dehydration, thereby contributing to increased sickle haemoglobin (HbS) polymerisation and ultimately vaso-occlusion.

### Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease [^112rbVSf]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Two hundred and three patients with SCD underwent allogeneic HSCT at either the NIH (N = 113) or the CNH (N = 90) between 2005 and 2019. Forty patients were excluded from the analysis due to incomplete documentation (N = 22) or less than 2 years of follow-up at the time of data analysis (N = 18). One hundred sixty-three patients with SCD were included in the analysis. Sixty percent (N = 98) of the patients were male (P < .001). Ninety-one percent (N = 148) had HbSS (P < .001). The average age at the time of HSCT was 21 years (range, 7 months-64 years). Most patients received nonmyeloablative conditioning (75%, N = 123, P < .001) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (72%, N = 118, P < .001).

At the time of data collection, there were 16 deaths reported in 203 patients who were treated between 2005 and 2019. Of these, 9 died within 2 years of transplantation and 1 died after 2 years but had incomplete pretransplant documentation; therefore, these patients were not included in the analysis. For patients with greater than 2 years of follow-up, the average time to death was 81 months (range, 54–137 months) due to gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or infection/sepsis.

Details regarding the 40 patients who were excluded from the analysis, including those who died with less than 2 years of follow-up data, are included in supplemental Table S2.

- **Patient characteristics**: Pain was the most frequently reported SCD-related comorbid condition before HSCT (55%, N = 89), followed by reACS (37%, N = 60).

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^111kDVbo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonist agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol has not been established. Factors that may contribute to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased cardiac output, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys, and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear to be minor and somewhat variable.

In angina pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length.

### Impaired hemoglobin clearance by sinusoidal endothelium promotes vaso-occlusion and liver injury in sickle cell disease [^1138d9mM]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that exacerbated liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) senescence can promote vaso-occlusion and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-associated chronic liver injury. We observed more pronounced LSEC senescence in clodronate-treated sickle cell disease (SCD) mouse livers. Consequently, we analyzed liver injury in these animals compared to untreated SCD mice. There was a significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase in clodronate-treated SCD mice compared to untreated ones, indicating exacerbated liver injury in treated mice. Furthermore, sinusoidal congestion and increased liver injury were more pronounced in clodronate-treated SCD mice, as shown by staining hepatic tissue with hematoxylin and eosin. Sirius red and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining revealed more collagen deposition and activated myofibroblasts in clodronate-treated SCD mouse livers than in untreated ones, suggesting more severe liver fibrosis in the clodronate-treated animals.

As demonstrated by qLIM, SCD mice exhibited loss of blood flow in several liver regions at baseline due to sinusoidal vaso-occlusion. Following treatment with clodronate liposomes, SCD mice showed a further increase in areas with vaso-occlusion. Depletion of hepatic Küpffer cells also resulted in a similar enhancement of hepatic senescence.

### A scientific renaissance: Novel drugs in sickle cell disease [^114r5VgQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

We have entered an era of exploding interest in therapeutics for sickle cell disease. The expansion in our understanding of sickle cell disease pathophysiology has enhanced the range of potential therapeutic targets. From induction of fetal hemoglobin to anti-adhesion molecules, we are potentially on the cusp of making life-altering modifications for individuals with sickle cell disease. This disease population cannot afford to let the momentum wane. Studies exploring combinations of therapies affecting multiple steps in the pathophysiology and exploring novel and clinically relevant outcomes are incumbent.

### Impact of an individualized pain plan to treat sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive episodes in the emergency department [^1176LMew]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

**Results**: One hundred fifty-three patients completed the baseline survey, returned for an ED visit, and completed a follow-up survey on PPQ of care after the ED visit. Demographics are reported, with most participants being African American, female, and of genotype SS/Sβ 0. One hundred thirty-five providers completed the baseline survey and at least one follow-up survey after managing a study patient in the ED.

### Effect of poloxamer 188 vs placebo on painful vaso-occlusive episodes in children and adults with sickle cell disease: A randomized clinical trial [^116UAgNE]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Although effective agents are available to prevent painful vaso-occlusive episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no disease-modifying therapies for ongoing painful episodes; treatment remains supportive. A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of these episodes, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea.

The objective is to reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes.

Design, setting, and participants: This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial. Conducted from May 2013 to February 2016, it included 66 hospitals across 12 countries and 60 cities. A total of 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-β0 thalassemia, or S-β+ thalassemia disease), aged 4 to 65 years, with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included.

Interventions involved a 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 administered intravenously, followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194).

Main outcomes and measures were time in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants, with a separate analysis for those younger than 16 years.

Results: Of 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), with the primary outcome available for 384 (99.0%). The 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and the 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.0%).

The 2025 WHO guidelines on the management of sickle cell disease, particularly concerning pregnant patients, recommend evaluating additional risk factors for thromboembolism in those with SCD who are not hospitalized. These factors include prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) following vaso-occlusive events. The guidelines advise following local recommendations for initiating thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients who have an elevated risk of thrombotic events, such as prior VTE, obesity, and inherited thrombophilia.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^1162VhDN]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

4.4 Challenge: The steady state itself

Unfortunately, the SCA "steady state" is anything but steady. In Figure 2A, we illustrate that even subjects with very mild SCA do not exhibit sufficient biomarker instability during a true "steady state" for single-timepoint measures to be informative, and combining single-timepoint measures as an "index" simply compounds the potential error. Consequently, we do not even know what the SCA steady state really looks like. Solving this is necessary to construct alternative, valid definitions of severity and to define pre-therapy baselines.

- **Taming the instability of "steady state"**: (A) Instability of steady state is shown by biomarkers sampled longitudinally from three historically mild SCA subjects, without symptoms and no acute events more than three months before or after this study. Each symbol type indicates one of the subjects. For each biomarker, the shaded area indicates the range for normal subjects. (B) Testing for efficacy while controlling for instability. Here, the efficacy of oral sulfasalazine for downregulating endothelial adhesion molecule expression in one SCA subject was tested. Activation is expressed as a percentage of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) positive for three adhesion molecules (open symbols) and tissue factor (closed symbol). Steady state baseline is established empirically by all values collected off-drug (the box). Dark bars show days on-drug; the indicated day numbers identify the start and stop dates for the mini-trials. Figure reproduced with permission from Ref. 13.

### SPL drug information for nadolol [^112hBSAh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nadolol PO (also known as Corgard):

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Use caution in vasospastic angina, as β-blockers without alpha1-blocking activity can cause unopposed coronary vasoconstriction, worsening symptoms.

- **Exacerbation of bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic diseases, as nadolol may impair bronchodilation by blocking beta2 receptors; its use is generally discouraged.

- **Exacerbation of HF**: Use caution in patients with compensated HF. Monitor closely for signs of decompensation, and discontinue gradually if HF develops.

- **Exacerbation of muscle weakness, double vision**: Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Use caution in patients with psoriasis.

- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral vascular disease**: Use caution in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders, including Raynaud's disease or syndrome and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.

- **Hypertension**: Use extreme caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Ensure adequate α-blockade is achieved before initiating nadolol to prevent a paradoxical increase in BP.

- **Major surgery**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-blockers should not be routinely withdrawn before major surgery, but their effect on adrenergic response may increase anesthesia and surgical risks.

- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of β-blocker therapy to prevent symptom exacerbation or the precipitation of a thyroid storm.

### Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease [^1135vwwJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In people with sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells cause the occlusion of small blood vessels, which presents as episodes of severe pain known as pain crises or vaso-occlusive crises. The pain can occur in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body and may last several hours to days. Pain relief during crises includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. The efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in pain crises has been a subject of controversy; hypotheses have been made suggesting a beneficial response due to its vasodilator properties, yet no conclusive evidence has been presented. This review aimed to evaluate the available randomized controlled studies addressing this topic.

- **Objectives**: To capture the body of evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease, and to assess the relevance, robustness, and validity of the treatment to better guide medical practice in the fields of hematology and palliative care, since the recent literature seems to favor the involvement of palliative care for such people.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We searched for unpublished work in the abstract books of the European Haematology Association conference, the American Society of Hematology conference, the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting, the Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings, and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^111rynwn]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

**Multi-agent rationale**: As amply demonstrated by malignancies, agents having insufficient efficacy individually may still contribute benefit if deployed as a multi-drug regimen. In SCA, a wealth of potential targets reside within a multi-faceted pathobiology. Yet, its vast complexity could mean that therapeutic efficacy from multiple agents will be maximized if they converge upon the same "chokepoint" step in pathobiology. One of these, targeting HbS polymerization, already receives much attention. Here, as our example, we propose targeting another, ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) pathophysiology.

### Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults [^1112qYdj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in individuals who have inherited two mutant globin genes, one from each parent, at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, making SCD the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. The manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are due to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back, or chest but can occur anywhere and last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis are both acute and recurrent.

Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice, and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction with rehydrating the patient to reduce the sickling process.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises.

### Novel therapies in sickle cell disease [^115FXzBC]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD), there remains a paucity of available agents for the prevention and treatment of specific SCD-related complications. Recently, there has been significant progress in the development of novel drugs for this disease. These agents, which increase the production of fetal hemoglobin, improve red blood cell hydration, increase the availability of nitric oxide, and possess anti-inflammatory effects, are in various stages of clinical development. With the complex pathophysiology of SCD, it is unlikely that a single agent will prevent or treat all the sequelae of this disease. As a result, patients may benefit from treatment with a combination of agents that possess different mechanisms of action. This overview discusses selected novel agents that appear promising in SCD.

### Activated monocytes in sickle cell disease: Potential role in the activation of vascular endothelium and vaso-occlusion [^111PiCUE]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive crises. It is hypothesized that monocytes are activated in sickle cell disease and can enhance vaso-occlusion by activating the endothelium. To test this hypothesis, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were incubated with sickle and normal mononuclear leukocytes, and endothelial activation was measured.

Endothelial cells incubated with sickle mononuclear leukocytes were more activated than those incubated with normal mononuclear leukocytes, as judged by the increased endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, tissue factor, and the adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Monocytes, not lymphocytes or platelets, were the mononuclear cells responsible for activating endothelial cells. Sickle monocytes triggered endothelial nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation.

- **Cell-to-cell contact**: Enhanced but was not required for activation.

- **Role of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta**: Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta) blocked activation of the endothelium by monocytes. Peripheral blood monocytes from patients with sickle cell disease had 34% more IL-1beta (P = 0.002) and 139% more TNF-alpha (P = 0.002) per cell than normal monocytes.

- **Adhesion molecule expression**: Sixty percent of sickle monocytes expressed the adhesion molecule ligand CD11b on their surfaces compared with only 20% of normal monocytes (P = 0.002).

Serum C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, was increased 12-fold in sickle serum compared to normal serum (P = 0.002).

### Acute colonic pseudoobstruction in a child with sickle cell disease treated with neostigmine [^115mi4WT]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a disorder that produces significant morbidity and mortality. Vaso-occlusive pain crises are the most common presenting symptom associated with sickle cell patients. A rare, yet important to recognize, complication of sickle cell disease is acute colonic pseudoobstruction, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome. These patients may present with symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from other etiologies of abdominal pain, but a thorough diagnostic workup can provide important clues. Furthermore, there is no agreement on the optimal treatment of pseudoobstruction. We report the first pediatric case of acute pseudoobstruction secondary to sickle cell disease that was treated successfully with neostigmine. Early recognition of this phenomenon is important as it alters patient management, can be treated medically, and may avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^115FW9K4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that affects up to 100,000 people in the United States. The abnormality resides in the hemoglobin molecule with the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta globin chain. The resultant abnormal hemoglobin, called sickle hemoglobin or HbS, is less soluble than the wild type and forms a polymer upon deoxygenation, resulting in a shape change from the normal red cell disk to an elongated sickle form. SCD occurs when the HbS mutation is homozygous or is coinherited with another beta globin chain gene mutation, such as beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C. Patients with SCD have a chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent episodes of vaso-occlusion of small blood vessels leading to acute pain episodes, as well as acute and chronic injury to lungs, heart, kidneys, bone, and the central nervous system.

When preparing a patient with SCD for surgery, there are many factors to consider. Intraoperatively, surgery may lead to hypotension, acidosis, hypoxia, frequent exposure to low temperatures, vasoconstriction, venous stasis, and increased stress, all of which can promote increased sickling and potentially induce vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, patients with SCD have higher risks of perioperative infection due to functional asplenia, and an increased risk of perioperative thrombosis as a result of the underlying hypercoagulable state. Preoperative planning is required to help minimize the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^112fER4e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **I/R as a target**: The physical chemistry of HbS dictates that most RBC cannot sickle within the microvasculature unless their transit time is slowed to overcome the two relevant delay times. Such slowing, resulting from blood cell adhesion to the vascular wall, necessitates an adhesion-engendering endothelial surface, which in turn requires inflammation. It has been proposed — and supported experimentally — that I/R is what provokes the robust inflammatory state of SCA, which is reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.

	- I/R refers to the physiology of resolving vascular occlusion, triggered by the restoration of flow and, consequently, oxygen availability. It is distinct from hypoxia or unresolved occlusion. In general medicine, I/R underlies the consequences of large vessel occlusive events, such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. In SCA, however, I/R likely arises from recurring, smaller, multi-focal occlusive events. In particular, I/R in SCA establishes cyclicality that incessantly drives inflammation. In this context, I/R assumes a Janus-like status, comprising both the beginning and the end of the core pathobiologic vector.

- **Initiation of I/R**: Experimental models revealed that I/R initiation involves several prominent actors at the local site of the ischemic event: oxidant generation, NFκB activation, endothelial activation, TNF elaboration, sentinel cell activation (resident macrophages, mast cells), and leukocyte infiltration.

### Longitudinal assessment of adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 at steady state and during vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease [^111BEto2]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex multi-system organ condition that is characterized by frequent and unpredictable vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and significant phenotypic variability. Lack of reliable biomarkers to objectively define VOCs in SCD has hindered the development and FDA approval of SCD-modifying therapies. Therefore, there is a need to identify and validate blood-based prognostic biomarkers to stratify individuals at the highest risk for vaso-occlusive complications earlier in the disease progression to prevent acute VOCs, vasculopathy, and other end-organ events.

More than 100 biomarkers have been identified in SCD, although none have been shown to reliably predict VOCs. Pathologic adhesive interactions of sickle erythrocytes (SSRBCs) with the vascular endothelium contribute to VOCs, resulting in impaired microvascular blood flow, tissue ischemia, severe pain, and end-organ damage. Static and flow-based adhesion assays have been used for decades to describe adhesion in SCD since earlier studies demonstrated that SSRBCs are more adherent than non-sickle erythrocytes and observed a link between SSRBC adhesion and SCD severity. Since then, numerous adhesion receptor/ligand pairs expressed on sickle blood cells, endothelial cells, and the subendothelial matrix mediating pathologic adhesion in SCD have been identified. Of these, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4 or alpha4beta1) is among the most well-characterized adhesion receptors in SCD. VLA-4 is expressed on immature red blood cells, resulting in increased adhesiveness to the vascular endothelium.

### Current and future status of beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension [^113ZnnoC]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension by all Joint National Committees (JNCs) for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure from the first to the last (JNC-7) in 2003. However, recently, questions have been raised by several investigators regarding the antihypertensive effectiveness and safety of these drugs. The Medline literature on this subject was searched and pertinent studies were retrieved. Other relevant references from existing publications were also retrieved and analyzed up to 2007.

Additionally, a historical perspective on the discovery of beta-blockers and their mechanism of action is given. Most of the reviewed short-term and long-term clinical trials demonstrate an effective and safe antihypertensive pattern for the beta-blockers. The weaknesses identified include the adverse effect of older beta-blockers on glucose control and stroke protection, especially in older persons. These adverse effects are attributed to their mechanism of action and BP effectiveness.

Based on the evidence presented, beta-blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs and should still be recommended as first-line therapy in most uncomplicated hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other drugs. There are reservations regarding their administration to diabetic and older hypertensive patients. However, when compelling indications for their use exist, they should not be withheld.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116MQuxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At doses greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The effects of propranolol are due to the selective blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are found primarily in the heart. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of ventricular rate during arrhythmias. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in smooth muscle, including vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary muscles.

### Vasoactive and antifibrotic properties of cannabinoids and applications to vasospastic/vaso-occlusive disorders: A systematic review [^114xdi2t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Management of vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders is a complex challenge, with treatments showing varied success. Cannabinoids have demonstrated both vasodilatory and antifibrotic properties, which present potential mechanisms for therapeutic relief. No existing review examines these effects in peripheral circulation in relation to vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders. This study aims to investigate the vasodilatory and antifibrotic properties of cannabinoids in peripheral vasculature for application in vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders affecting the hand.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted by two independent reviewers across PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL to identify studies in accordance with the determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Information regarding study design, medication, dosage, and hemodynamic or antifibrotic effects was extracted. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study findings as appropriate.

- **Results**: A total of 584 articles were identified, and 32 were selected for inclusion. Studies were grouped by effect type: hemodynamic (n = 17, 53%) and antifibrotic (n = 15, 47%). Vasodilatory effects, including reduced perfusion pressure, increased functional capillary density, inhibition of vessel contraction, and increased blood flow, were reported in 82% of studies. Antifibrotic effects, including reduced dermal thickening, reduced collagen synthesis, and reduced fibroblast migration, were reported in 100% of studies.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, cannabinoids were found to have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects, contributing to their potential use in treating vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders.

### Management of vasoocclusive pain events in sickle cell disease [^113EXuW6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Vasoocclusive pain events (VOEs) are the primary cause of morbidity and account for most emergency department visits and hospitalizations for patients with SCD in the United States and Europe. The nature of VOE makes its management extremely challenging. There are no large controlled trials of analgesic regimens for VOE, and smaller trials have generally failed to produce an optimal course of therapy. Therefore, treatment recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and anecdotal experience. Although VOEs are not life-threatening, inadequate treatment may result in unnecessary morbidity and life-threatening complications. Health care providers caring for patients with SCD must be well informed about the management of VOE. This continuing medical education article will provide a summary of the management of acute pain events in SCD with particular emphasis on adequate analgesia.

### The role of beta-blockers as a cornerstone of cardiovascular therapy [^115f3q9S]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The beta-adrenergic blockade as a therapeutic approach first emerged in the 1950s. Over the past five decades, the total number of indications suggested and the remarkable number approved by regulatory agencies places beta-blockade far ahead of all competing treatments, not only in the cardiovascular area but in all of therapeutics. Differentiation of beta-adrenergic blocking agents has been made on the basis of beta1 selectivity, duration of action, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, lipophilicity, and whether the beta-adrenergic blocking action is accompanied by an alpha-adrenergic blocking action.

With the development of nebivolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that also activates nitric oxide synthase in blood vessels, comes a new therapeutic option. Endothelial dysfunction with loss of nitric oxide production is a common feature in many cardiovascular diseases. This fascinating class of drugs continues to provide us with new and important therapeutic opportunities.

### Advances in vasospasm treatment and prevention [^113mTo7w]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) depends on several factors, including the severity of the initial event, perioperative medical management, surgical variables, and the incidence of complications. Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is sure to consistently respond to treatment, emphasizing the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of SAH-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. To this end, our paper reviews the relevant literature on the main therapies employed for CV after aSAH and discusses possible avenues for future investigations. Management of this condition consists of maximal medical therapy, including the triple H regimen and oral administration of calcium antagonists, followed by endovascular balloon angioplasty and/or injection of vasodilatory agents for refractory cases. As the precise pathophysiology of CV is further elucidated, the development of promising investigational therapies will follow.

### Potential risks of chronic sildenafil use for priapism in sickle cell disease [^114gFkHN]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Priapism is a common concern in sickle cell disease. With a high frequency of recurrences and serious long-term sequelae, a preventative, rather than traditionally reactive approach, needs to be taken in these patients. Reports have shown successful use of sildenafil as a prophylactic treatment but have failed to address adverse outcomes, including vasoocclusive pain crises, of chronic sildenafil therapy in sickle cell patients.

- **Aims**: We wish to draw attention to the potential adverse outcomes of this therapy on the overall state of the patient's disease for consideration in future studies.

- **Methods**: We used sildenafil in a patient suffering from almost daily attacks of priapism.

- **Results**: Sildenafil was successful in decreasing the frequency of priapism; however, our patient experienced an increased frequency of vasoocclusive crises, something not previously addressed.

- **Conclusion**: Future studies of sildenafil use in sickle cell disease need to assess the global state of the disease, not just the frequency of priapism.

### Impact of an individualized pain plan to treat sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive episodes in the emergency department [^115VSkPw]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic hemoglobinopathy associated with several acute and chronic complications that affect multiple organ systems, leading to frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and reduced life expectancy. The leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits for individuals with SCD is acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). VOEs occur suddenly and cause acute pain often requiring parenteral opioids, sometimes in high doses. Individuals with SCD report difficulty in obtaining opioid medication, leading to dissatisfaction with ED care. Emergency health care providers are reluctant to treat VOEs with high doses of opioids due to the opioid epidemic and state or hospital policies restricting opioid administration. As a result, individuals with SCD are often stigmatized as drug-seeking, resulting in undertreatment of pain.

In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute published evidence-based recommendations to guide ED treatment of VOEs. One important recommendation is the implementation of individualized pain plans (IPPs), which can be tailored to include patient-specific drug and dose recommendations. Individuals treated with an IPP experienced a greater reduction in pain compared to those treated with a weight-based opioid protocol. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology recommended using multidisciplinary teams to develop IPPs to treat VOEs and proposed embedding the IPPs in electronic medical records (EMRs).

### P-selectin mediates the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium [^113p5ES6]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

The adherence of sickle red blood cells (RBCs) to the vascular endothelium may contribute to painful vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell adherence involves several receptor-mediated processes and may be potentiated by the up-regulated expression of adhesion molecules on activated endothelial cells. Recent results showed that thrombin rapidly increases the adhesivity of endothelial cells for sickle erythrocytes. The report presents the first evidence for the novel adhesion of normal and, to a greater extent, sickle RBCs to endothelial P-selectin.

Studies of the possible interaction of erythrocytes with P-selectin revealed that either P-selectin blocking monoclonal antibodies or sialyl Lewis tetrasaccharide inhibits the enhanced adherence of normal and sickle cells to thrombin-treated endothelial cells. Both RBC types also adhere to immobilized recombinant P-selectin. Pretreating erythrocytes with sialidase reduces their adherence to activated endothelial cells and to immobilized recombinant P-selectin.

Herein, the first evidence is presented for the binding of normal or sickle erythrocytes to P-selectin. This novel finding suggests that P-selectin inhibition be considered as a potential approach to therapy for the treatment of painful vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease.

### Inflammatory mediators promote strong sickle cell adherence to endothelium under venular flow conditions [^112JkrhB]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). High credibility.

Adherence of sickle erythrocytes to endothelium in venules is thought to initiate or propagate vaso-occlusive episodes. Because of blood shear forces with normal microvascular flow, adherence in post-capillary venules requires binding via high-affinity receptor-mediated pathways. Microvascular flow in sickle patients is episodic, even in asymptomatic patients, so adherence may also occur at low shear, not requiring high-affinity binding.

Sickle cell binding to endothelium was quantified under flow or static incubation with unusually large vWF, thrombospondin, alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1, or alpha(4)beta(1)/fibronectin (FN). Adherence under flow at 0.5 dyne/cm² shear stress leads to the greatest number of adherent sickle cells. Adherence under flow at 1.0 dyne/cm² leads to the strongest adherence. Static incubation conditions promote weak adherence of low numbers of sickle cells to endothelium.

Following attachment at 1.0 dyne/cm², adherence strength was 2.5 ± 0.1 or 2.6 ± 0.2 dynes/cm² for alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1 or alpha(4)beta(1)/FN pathways, a level 50% greater than adherence strength mediated by thrombospondin or ULvWF (1.7 ± 0.08 or 1.6 ± 0.07 dynes/cm², respectively). Sickle cell adhesion promoted by simultaneous activation of alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1 and alpha(4)beta(1)/FN pathways is the strongest at 6.2 ± 0.2 dynes/cm², and adherent red cells resist detachment shear stresses up to 10 dynes/cm².

These data demonstrate that sickle cell adhesion to endothelium is regulated both by receptor/ligand affinity and flow conditions.

### Sevuparin for the treatment of acute pain crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112j6Y3k]. The Lancet Haematology (2021). High credibility.

There are no approved treatments for vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. Sevuparin is a novel non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparinoid with anti-adhesive properties. In this study, we tested whether sevuparin could shorten vaso-occlusive crisis duration in hospitalised patients with sickle cell disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study in 16 public access clinical hospitals in the Netherlands, Lebanon, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. Patients aged 12–50 years with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (types HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ 0-thalassaemia, or HbSβ + -thalassaemia) on a stable dose of hydroxyurea, hospitalised with vaso-occlusive crisis for parenteral opioid analgesia with a projected stay of more than 48 hours, were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme to receive sevuparin (18 mg/kg per day) or placebo (NaCl, 0.9% solution) intravenously for 2–7 days until vaso-occlusive crisis resolution. All individuals involved in the trial were masked to treatment allocation. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was time to vaso-occlusive crisis resolution, defined as freedom from parenteral opioid use (in the preceding 6–10 hours) and readiness for discharge as judged by the patient or physician. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02515838.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 7, 2015, and Feb 10, 2019, 144 patients were randomly assigned and administered sevuparin (n = 69) or placebo.

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of adults with sickle cell disease [^114ETKKc]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of healthcare maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD.

RCTs impacting practices address the use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, the intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria. However, most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied, and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data.

While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for the development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### Epinephrine-induced activation of LW-mediated sickle cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion in vivo [^111Qmk9k]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle red cell (SS RBC) adhesion is believed to contribute to the process of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). We previously found that the LW RBC adhesion receptor can be activated by epinephrine to mediate SS RBC adhesion to endothelial alphavbeta3 integrin. To determine the contribution of LW activation to vaso-occlusive events in vivo, we investigated whether in vitro treatment of SS RBCs by epinephrine resulted in vaso-occlusion in intact microvasculature after RBC infusion into nude mice. Epinephrine enhanced human SS but not normal RBC adhesion to murine endothelial cells in vitro and to endothelium in vivo, promoting vaso-occlusion and RBC organ sequestration.

Murine sickle RBCs also responded to epinephrine with increased adhesion to postcapillary endothelium in nude mice. Epinephrine-induced SS RBC adhesion, vaso-occlusion, and RBC organ trapping could be prevented by the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonist, propranolol. Infusion of soluble recombinant LW also significantly reduced adhesion and vaso-occlusion. In addition, epinephrine-treated SS RBCs induced activation of murine leukocyte adhesion to endothelium as well.

We conclude that LW activation by epinephrine via beta-AR stimulation can promote both SS RBC and leukocyte adhesion as well as vaso-occlusion, suggesting that both epinephrine and LW play potentially pathophysiological roles in SCD.

### Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease [^112sRWgk]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide, including approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications arise due to complex pathological pathways 'downstream' from a point mutation in DNA. These include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately, a risk of cumulative organ damage leading to reduced lifespan for affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies become widely accessible to most patients with sickle cell disease.

At the time of writing, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children. It has also been significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a limited number of subjects, though they have only undergone limited follow-up thus far. During a period when over 20 agents were approved for cystic fibrosis treatment by the Food and Drug Administration, only two drugs for sickle cell disease — hydroxyurea and L-glutamine — received similar approval, despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry. In the last decade, they have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction and inhibition.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^111whY3h]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

- **Objective**: To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

- **Evidence review**: Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

- **Findings**: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years and annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia. Long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke is recommended for children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include the rapid initiation of opioids for the treatment of severe pain associated with a vaso-occlusive crisis and the use of incentive spirometry in hospitalized patients.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^115L8Ztg]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

These challenges and barriers are several and substantial, and they pertain to any combination of drugs within the universe defined by the nexus we discussed in our first paragraph. After delineating these challenges, we suggest approaches to their solution.

- **Our perceptions are limiting**: The scope of therapeutics considered by our field has been limited by at least three perceptions. We suggest that modification of these perceptions is justifiable and would broaden the universe of therapeutic targets and available drugs worth consideration.

- **Defining severity independent of events**: We suspect this can be achieved via the concept of "robustness". The robustness of the sickle cell anemia (SCA) underlying risk state may be quantifiable through the activity level of its causal core biological process(es), as measured during steady state. Could this be developed and applied as a quantifiable predictor of forward trajectory? Would it enable risk stratification of SCA patients?

- **Events vs. risk state**: Although understandable, our traditional focus on events (pain crisis, acute chest syndrome, stroke) restricts the operational definition of efficacy to impacting event occurrence. It may be more helpful, and is pathobiologically more accurate, to emphasize that SCA is not merely events per se. Rather, it is a risk state from which events emerge, and substantial pathology progresses regardless of event occurrence. In these respects, SCA is analogous to atherosclerosis in the general population, for which disease management requires blunting the underlying risk state.

### Mechanisms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated venodilation in humans [^115S5pYq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors results in both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent venodilation; however, findings from earlier studies have been inconsistent. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of isoproterenol (INN, isoprenaline)-induced venodilation by investigating dorsal hand vein responses.

- **Methods**: In phenylephrine-constricted veins, isoproterenol (2–514 ng/min) was infused, with and without oral pretreatment of 1 g acetylsalicylic acid (n = 7) or 5 mg of the selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist bisoprolol (n = 7). Additionally, isoproterenol was coinfused with the nitric oxide inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) (6.3 micromol/min [n = 6]), with selective blockers of calcium (Ca++)-dependent potassium (K+) channels (tetraethylammonium, 300 microg/min [n = 6]) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels (glyburide [INN, glibenclamide], 20 microg/min [n = 6]), or with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate inhibitor methylene blue (13 microg/min [n = 6]). Finally, l-NMMA was coinfused with potassium chloride (20 mmol/L) to inhibit hyperpolarization (n = 6).

- **Results**: Isoproterenol induced dose-dependent venodilation to 67.4% ± 6.8%. Oral pretreatment with bisoprolol (P = 0.340) or acetylsalicylic acid (P = 0.760) did not affect isoproterenol-induced venodilation. Coinfusion of isoproterenol and l-NMMA relaxed the veins to the same extent as in the presence of isoproterenol alone. Neither inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (P = 0.196) nor blockade of Ca

### Vasoactive factors in sickle cell disease: In vitro evidence for endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstriction [^113zZwci]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

While systemic plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels are increased during acute crisis in sickle cell disease, the relative levels of potent vasoactive factors that contribute to the regulation of vascular function, such as ET-1, NO, and cell-free hemoglobin, during the course of periodic vaso-occlusive episodes remain unclear. Moreover, whether and to what extent sickling-induced release of ET-1 alters vascular tone is not completely understood. To investigate the sequential changes in circulating vasoactive factors, we measured plasma ET-1, NO metabolites (NOx), and cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) before (steady-state), during (crisis), and following a vaso-occlusive (post-crisis) episode.

Steady-state ET-1 levels (fmol/mL) increased from 2.3 ± 0.4 to 11.0 ± 1.4 and 4.2 ± 1.0 during crisis and post-crisis periods, respectively. There was no significant difference in plasma NOx levels. Cell-free Hb levels were significantly higher in sickle cell patients in all phases compared to the control group. Especially during crisis, cell-free Hb levels were elevated by 4-fold (209,000 ± 31,000 vs. 46,000 ± 5,300 ng/mL in steady-state).

Conditioned medium from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to sickled erythrocytes prepared by deoxygenation induced contraction of aortic rings, and this effect was blocked by an ET(A) receptor antagonist. These findings indicate that ET-1 is the predominant contractile factor released by cultured endothelial cells upon exposure to deoxygenated sickled SS erythrocytes, and the ET-1-NO-NO scavenger balance is altered in favor of vasoconstriction.

### Multiple inducers of endothelial NOS (eNOS) dysfunction in sickle cell disease [^115a7cjj]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

Within the exceedingly complex pathobiology of SCD, there are ten identifiable factors that have been shown, largely in other contexts, to adversely impact eNOS function. At present, it is impossible to identify a single, dominant, ECD-inducing agent at which therapy could perhaps be directed.

If specific endothelial-sparing therapeutics are considered, this would seem to argue for the application of agents known to exert multiple beneficial effects upon the endothelial cell's biology or for the use of a combination of agents. In SCD, observation of abnormal flow-mediated dilation, the clinical test commonly used to detect ECD, could plausibly derive from true eNOS dysfunction, as reviewed herein, or from either of the two noted examples of ECD mimicry.

### Beyond hydroxyurea: New and old drugs in the pipeline for sickle cell disease [^111h2tJj]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydroxyurea to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes, sickle cell disease (SCD) has continued to be treated primarily with analgesics for pain relief. However, elucidation of the multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to vaso-occlusion and tissue injury in SCD has now resulted in a burgeoning effort to identify new treatment modalities to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of the disease. The development of new drugs, as well as the investigation of drugs previously used in other settings, have targeted cell adhesion, inflammatory pathways, upregulation of hemoglobin F, hemoglobin polymerization and sickling, coagulation, and platelet activation. Although these efforts have not yet yielded drugs ready for FDA approval, several early studies have been extremely encouraging. Moreover, the marked increase in clinical pharmaceutical research addressing SCD and the new and old drugs in the pipeline makes it reasonable to expect that we will soon have new treatments for SCD.

### Endothelial beta3-adrenoreceptors mediate nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation of coronary microvessels in response to the third-generation beta-blocker nebivolol [^114aNwDW]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The therapeutic effects of nonspecific beta-blockers are limited by vasoconstriction, thus justifying the interest in molecules with ancillary vasodilating properties. Nebivolol is a selective beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonist that releases nitric oxide (NO) through incompletely characterized mechanisms. We identified endothelial beta3-adrenoreceptors in human coronary microarteries that mediate endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation and hypothesized that nebivolol activates these beta3-adrenoreceptors.

- **Methods and results**: Nebivolol dose-dependently relaxed rodent coronary resistance microarteries studied by videomicroscopy (10 micromol/L, -86 ± 6% of prostaglandin F2alpha contraction); this was sensitive to NO synthase (NOS) inhibition, unaffected by the beta(1–2)-blocker nadolol, and prevented by the beta(1–2–3)-blocker bupranolol (P < 0.05; n = 3 to 8). Importantly, nebivolol failed to relax microarteries from beta3-adrenoreceptor-deficient mice. Nebivolol (10 micromol/L) also relaxed human coronary microvessels (-71 ± 5% of KCl contraction); this was dependent on a functional endothelium and NO synthase but insensitive to beta(1–2)-blockade (all P < 0.05). In a mouse aortic ring assay of neoangiogenesis, nebivolol induced neocapillary tube formation in rings from wild-type but not beta3-adrenoreceptor- or endothelial NOS-deficient mice. In cultured endothelial cells, 10 micromol/L nebivolol increased NO release by 200% as measured by electron paramagnetic spin trapping, which was also reversed by NOS inhibition. In parallel, endothelial NOS was dephosphorylated.
