## Question

What causes potassium of 5.3

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of a serum potassium of 5.3 mmol/L and how to interpret and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify 5.3 mmol/L within accepted definitions of hyperkalemia. Then, I should verify the three major pathophysiologic mechanisms that raise potassium. Next, I will review the most common etiologies, including impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, and increased intake. After that, I need to check for pseudohyperkalemia and other spurious causes. Finally, I will consider patient-specific risk factors and outline a pragmatic evaluation and management plan, including when to treat and when to monitor closely.

> Let me first confirm the classification. A potassium of 5.3 mmol/L sits at the upper end of normal in many laboratories and is variably labeled as mild hyperkalemia depending on the guideline; ESC and KDIGO-related frameworks often use ≥ 5.0 mmol/L as the lower threshold for mild hyperkalemia, whereas UK Renal Association uses > 5.5 mmol/L for mild, so 5.3 mmol/L is borderline and warrants context-specific attention rather than alarm [^1172XMC2] [^114ypRXH] [^113hTA5U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the pathophysiology. Hyperkalemia arises from three broad mechanisms: impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts of potassium out of cells, and increased potassium intake or release; most sustained cases reflect reduced excretion, while acute rises often reflect shifts or intake, and many presentations are multifactorial, so I need to keep all three in mind as I evaluate 5.3 mmol/L [^113hTA5U] [^115h7Ejq] [^114dKtnY].

> I will now examine impaired renal excretion as the most common cause of sustained hyperkalemia. Reduced eGFR is a dominant driver; a meta-analysis of over 1.2 million CKD patients showed that each 15 mL/min decline in eGFR approximately doubles the odds of potassium > 5.5 mmol/L, and hyperkalemia risk rises progressively as eGFR falls below 60 and especially below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², so I should confirm kidney function immediately in anyone with 5.3 mmol/L who is not obviously healthy [^114XLerS] [^116ABgiW]. Wait, let me verify medication contributions; RAAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors, ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone or eplerenone, and finerenone all reduce renal potassium excretion and can tip borderline levels upward, particularly when combined or used in CKD or heart failure, so I need a careful medication reconciliation and, if potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L, consider dose adjustment or closer monitoring per guidance [^114MMLYx] [^1172Fcb1] [^113pqGhr] [^114WwTAf]. I should also remember NSAIDs, trimethoprim, and heparin as additional offenders that impair distal nephron potassium handling, especially in patients with reduced GFR or diabetes [^114XLerS] [^112nuPQe].

> Next, I should review transcellular shifts that can acutely raise serum potassium without changing total body stores. Metabolic acidosis drives potassium out of cells, and hyperglycemia with insulin deficiency promotes a similar shift; in both settings, a potassium of 5.3 mmol/L may be an early warning sign of a dynamic process, so I need to check acid–base status and glucose promptly [^113hTA5U] [^115h7Ejq]. But wait, what if the patient is on beta-blockers or has just experienced tissue breakdown? Nonselective beta-blockade reduces cellular potassium uptake, and rhabdomyolysis or tumor lysis release intracellular potassium, so I should ask about muscle pain, dark urine, recent crush injury, or chemotherapy, and review the medication list for beta-blockers that could worsen a shift [^113MwkGx] [^1123QwNr].

> Let me consider increased intake or release next. Exogenous sources include potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, and potassium-rich foods; in someone with preserved renal function, intake alone rarely sustains 5.3 mmol/L, but in CKD or with concomitant RAAS blockade, even modest excess can be decisive, so I should ask about supplements and diet and, if relevant, involve a dietitian early [^114dKtnY] [^113MwkGx] [^111GoG94]. I should double-check for iatrogenic potassium loads too, such as potassium phosphates used for hypophosphatemia; these products carry explicit warnings to avoid use if potassium is ≥ 4 mEq/L, underscoring how easily they can elevate serum potassium in borderline patients [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify that this isn't pseudohyperkalemia before I anchor on a diagnosis. Hemolysis from poor phlebotomy technique, prolonged tourniquet time, or delayed processing, as well as extreme leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, can artifactually elevate potassium; repeating the sample in a heparinized plasma tube and ensuring timely processing is a simple but critical step when 5.3 mmol/L is unexpected or discordant with the clinical picture [^1123QwNr] [^116UhpET].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-specific risk modifiers that lower the threshold for hyperkalemia. Diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and older age all increase risk, and observational data in heart failure show that potassium levels ≥ 5.0–5.5 mmol/L associate with worse outcomes, reinforcing the need for vigilance even when the number is "only" 5.3 mmol/L in the right context [^1162h5y3] [^1137zSfM]. Let me reconsider sex and race as modifiers; the large CKD meta-analysis suggested higher hyperkalemia risk with male sex and non-Black race across eGFR strata, though these are associations and should be interpreted alongside kidney function and medications rather than in isolation [^114XLerS].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical evaluation. First, repeat potassium to exclude pseudohyperkalemia and assess trajectory; if confirmed, check eGFR, electrolytes including bicarbonate, glucose, and consider a spot urine potassium to estimate the transtubular potassium gradient if the etiology remains unclear; concurrently, review all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents for potassium-raising drugs and reconcile supplements and salt substitutes [^113hTA5U] [^114dKtnY]. Wait, I should verify urgency; in an outpatient with 5.3 mmol/L and no ECG changes or high-risk features, urgent therapy is not indicated, but closer follow-up and cause-directed management are appropriate, whereas inpatients or those with CKD, diabetes, or heart failure merit expedited assessment and medication review [^115Lhcuz] [^112KvyxG].

> For management, let me think about risk stratification. If potassium is 5.3 mmol/L in a low-risk patient with preserved eGFR and no ECG changes, the priority is to identify and reverse the cause: adjust RAAS inhibitors or MRAs, stop NSAIDs or trimethoprim if feasible, treat acidosis or hyperglycemia, and provide dietary counseling; repeating potassium within 1–3 days is reasonable to ensure stability [^115h7Ejq] [^111GoG94]. If the patient is high risk (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, or on RAASi/MRA), I should increase monitoring frequency and consider proactive strategies such as dose reduction, temporary holds, or adding a potassium binder if hyperkalemia persists, balancing the mortality benefit of RAASi/MRA against potassium risk and following guideline-directed modification thresholds around 5.5 mmol/L [^1176vexx] [^113pqGhr] [^116BLNsA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that 5.3 mmol/L alone mandates acute pharmacologic lowering; that would be an overreach. Acute membrane-stabilizing therapy with IV calcium and intracellular shifting with insulin and beta-agonists are reserved for potassium ≥ 6.0–6.5 mmol/L or the presence of ECG changes, so at 5.3 mmol/L without red flags, observation with cause correction is the safer, evidence-aligned course while I continue to monitor for progression or ECG evolution [^115Lhcuz] [^112KvyxG] [^113hTA5U].

> In summary, a potassium of 5.3 mmol/L is a yellow flag that most often reflects impaired renal excretion from CKD and/or RAAS/MRA therapy, an acute transcellular shift from acidosis or hyperglycemia, or increased intake/supplementation; pseudohyperkalemia must be excluded, and patient-specific risk factors such as diabetes, heart failure, and age modulate concern. A measured, mechanism-targeted evaluation with timely repeat testing and medication/dietary optimization typically resolves borderline hyperkalemia and prevents progression, reserving emergency therapies for higher thresholds or ECG changes [^113hTA5U] [^1172XMC2] [^112KvyxG].

---

A potassium level of 5.3 mmol/L is a **mild hyperkalemia** [^1172XMC2] most often due to **impaired renal excretion** (CKD, ACEi/ARB, MRAs, NSAIDs) [^114XLerS], **transcellular shifts** (acidosis, hyperglycemia, beta-blockers, succinylcholine) [^114dKtnY], or **increased intake** (supplements, salt substitutes, diet) [^113MwkGx]. Less common causes include adrenal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and lab artifact (pseudohyperkalemia) [^1123QwNr]. Evaluate with repeat K+, eGFR, electrolytes, acid–base status, and ECG; manage by stopping offending drugs, treating shifts, and dietary restriction, with urgent therapy if ECG changes or severe symptoms occur [^115h7Ejq] [^112KvyxG].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hyperkalemia results from **three main mechanisms**:

- **Impaired renal excretion**: Reduced GFR, CKD, or drugs that inhibit aldosterone (ACEi/ARB, MRAs, NSAIDs, trimethoprim) [^114XLerS].
- **Transcellular shifts**: Acidosis, hyperglycemia, beta-blockers, succinylcholine, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis [^114dKtnY].
- **Increased intake**: Supplements, salt substitutes, high-K+ diet [^113MwkGx].

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

A potassium of 5.3 mmol/L is **mild hyperkalemia** [^1172XMC2] and is usually asymptomatic; however, it confers a **modestly increased risk of arrhythmias**, particularly in patients with CKD, heart failure, or on RAAS inhibitors [^112fF8mn]. Risk is higher with **rapid rises**, acidosis, or ECG changes [^115KhjSU].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm hyperkalemia**: Repeat K+ to exclude pseudohyperkalemia [^1123QwNr].
- **Assess renal function**: eGFR, creatinine, BUN [^notfound].
- **Evaluate acid–base status**: Bicarbonate, anion gap [^notfound].
- **Review medications**: ACEi/ARB, MRAs, NSAIDs, beta-blockers, supplements [^113MwkGx].
- **Check ECG**: Peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening [^113hTA5U].

---

## Management strategies

- **Identify and treat underlying cause**: Stop offending drugs, correct acidosis, treat hyperglycemia, manage CKD [^115h7Ejq].
- **Dietary modification**: Limit high-potassium foods and avoid salt substitutes [^111GoG94].
- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Consider potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) if persistent [^116BLNsA].
- **Monitor potassium**: Recheck frequently, especially if on RAAS inhibitors or with CKD [^1176vexx].

---

A potassium of 5.3 mmol/L reflects **mild hyperkalemia** from impaired excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased intake; confirm with repeat testing, assess renal and acid–base status, review medications, and treat the cause to prevent progression and arrhythmias [^113hTA5U].

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^112FCAPU]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Higher levels of dietary sodium intake and lower levels of dietary potassium intake are both associated with raised blood pressure (BP) and increased risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death. – There is a strong evidence base indicating that both reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake will reduce these risks through their BP-lowering effects. As a consequence, multiple authoritative bodies acknowledge these risks, and have made recommendations related to sodium and potassium intake. The World Health Organization (WHO), for example, has guidelines that make strong population-wide recommendations to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake. For sodium, the WHO has also explicitly proposed that all member states reduce mean population intake by 30% by 2025, with a target maximum intake of 2.0-g/day sodium (5.0-g/day salt), in support of global efforts to reduce the noncommunicable disease burden by one quarter.

Mean global sodium intake was recently estimated to be 4.3 g/day, which equates to about 10.8 g/day of table salt. The most recent corresponding estimated value for mean global potassium intake is about 2.3 g/day. These current intake values are substantially different from norms during hominid evolution when the estimated intake of sodium was about 0.5 g/day and the estimated potassium intake was about 10 g/day. Current sodium consumption varies substantially between populations with the estimated intake highest in the WHO Western Pacific region (6.2-g/day sodium and 15.6-g/day salt) driven by high consumption levels in China and lowest in Africa (2.7-g/day sodium and 6.7-g/day salt; Figure).

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

### Monobasic potassium phosphate and dibasic potassium phosphate (Potassium phosphates) [^115TP5jf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyperkalemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium [see Contraindications (4)]. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

When administering POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and use an alternative source of phosphate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The maximum initial or single dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

RISK FACTORS FOR HYPERKALEMIA

Quantitatively important risk factors

From the above, it is clear that the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal impairment - either AKI or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) - and any acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron. In CKD, hyperkalemia is typically encountered after the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) drops below 15 mL/min.

The risk factors for hyperkalemia were studied in a meta-analysis of data from > 1.2 million individuals with CKD. The risk of hyperkalemia (K > 5.5 mM) was strongly correlated with eGFR across the entire range of kidney function (from eGFR 15 to 105 mL/min). A decrease in eGFR of 15 mL/min approximately doubled the odds of hyperkalemia. Albuminuria was also a risk factor, but the association was far weaker (odds ratio for hyperkalemia < 2 even in heavy albuminuria). Other risk factors for hyperkalemia included male sex; non-black race; lower body mass index; smoking, history of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease or stroke and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or potassium-sparing diuretics. Unsurprisingly, the use of thiazide or loop diuretics was protective.

Drug therapies as risk factors for hyperkalemia

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to low-potassium diet, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to offer dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in non-hospitalized patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia with serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia, such as constipation, acidosis, and poorly controlled diabetes.
Offer dietary strategies to modify potassium intake for hospitalized patients with moderate or severe hyperkalemia after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to indications for monitoring (history of hyperkalemia), UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain repeat serum potassium measurement within 3 days, or as soon as feasible, if an episode of mild hyperkalemia (serum potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol/L) is detected unexpectedly in the outpatient setting.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^1172Fcb1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1)
Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure. Measure eGFR and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.3, 6.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L.

Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

5.2 Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure

Kerendia can cause worsening of renal function in patients with heart failure. Rarely, severe events associated with worsening renal function, including events requiring hospitalization, have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Measure eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment or with dose titration of Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Initiation of Kerendia in patients with heart failure and an eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m is not recommended.

Measure eGFR periodically during maintenance treatment with Kerendia in patients with heart failure. Consider delaying up-titration or interrupting treatment with Kerendia in patients who develop clinically significant worsening of renal function.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

### Osilodrostat (Isturisa) [^115YwWL4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Elevations in Adrenal Hormone Precursors and Androgens

ISTURISA blocks cortisol synthesis and may increase circulating levels of cortisol and aldosterone precursors (11-deoxy cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone) and androgens.

Elevated 11-deoxycorticosterone levels may activate mineralocorticoid receptors and cause hypokalemia, edema and hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating ISTURISA. Monitor patients treated with ISTURISA for hypokalemia, worsening of hypertension and edema. ISTURISA-induced hypokalemia should be treated with intravenous or oral potassium supplementation based on event severity. If hypokalemia persists despite potassium supplementation, consider adding mineralocorticoid antagonists. ISTURISA dose reduction or discontinuation may be necessary.

Accumulation of androgens may lead to hirsutism, hypertrichosis and acne (in females). Inform patients of the symptoms associated with hyperandrogenism and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^114wT2Gr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

CONSEQUENCES OF HYPERKALEMIA

The most notorious consequence of hyperkalemia is that of potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. However, there are several other consequences worthy of discussion. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality (although we do not know whether hyperkalemia causes increased mortality outside of the context of cardiac arrhythmia in extreme hyperkalemia). Consequently, hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — may prompt changes in prescribing practice (e.g. avoiding RAS blockade and MRAs). Finally, recent data show that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis and may contribute to peripheral neuropathy in CKD patients.

Mortality: epidemiology

Large observational studies demonstrate an association between hyperkalemia and an increased risk of death. In a meta-analysis of data from > 1.2 million individuals with CKD, serum [K +] exhibited a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a nadir at ∼4.2 mM. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was ∼1.22 for [K +] > 5.5 mM. This association persisted after adjustment for a large number of covariates. However, as there have been no large interventional studies testing the effects of potassium-lowering therapies (or of plasma [K +] targets) per se on mortality, we do not know whether this association is due to residual confounding (i.e. whether or not mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia causes an increased risk of death).

The most plausible mechanism whereby hyperkalemia could cause death is by the induction of fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia did indeed increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there are some observations to suggest that any mortality risk associated with hyperkalemia cannot be solely attributed to arrhythmogenic death. For example, in a racially diverse population of community-dwelling older adults, hyperkalemia was not associated with sudden cardiac death, whereas it was associated with death from cancer and other non-cardiac causes. Moreover, adverse outcomes have been associated with higher plasma [K +] values that remain well within the reference range. Therefore we still have much to learn about the methodology of epidemiological studies in this area and/or the pathogenic consequences of hyperkalemia.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1154JaRz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 presents the BP difference in our dose‐response meta‐analysis on the basis of achieved potassium excretion at the end of the trial, using as a reference point a potassium excretion of 90 mmol/d (3500 mg/d). The SBP and DBP change remained constant in the range of 90 to 150 mmol/d of achieved potassium excretion. Below these ranges of achieved potassium excretion, the intervention effects on BP were unfavorable, and a weak BP increase also appeared to occur at > 150 mmol/d. A potassium excretion of 30, 60, 120, 150, and 180 mmol/d resulted in SBP changes of 9.1 (95% CI, 4.6–13.5), 3.9 (95% CI, 2.1–5.8), −0.9 (95% CI, −1.6 to −0.2), −0.2 (95% CI, −2.2 to 1.8), and 0.7 (95% CI, −2.9 to 4.2) mm Hg, respectively, compared with the SBP associated with an excretion of 90 mmol/d. The corresponding DBP changes were 5.3 (95% CI, 0.9–9.7), 2.3 (95% CI, 0.5–4.1), −0.4 (95% CI, −1.5 to 0.7), 0.2 (95% CI, −3.0 to −3.3), and 0.8 (95% CI, −4.6 to 6.2). Again, as for the analysis based on the BP effects of difference in potassium excretion between the 2 exposures, the predicted mean SBP and DBP difference on the basis of a linear regression function shows an inverse association with achieved potassium intake (Figure S1).

### Serum potassium levels and mortality in acute myocardial infarction [^112a5MdK]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium levels between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These guidelines are based on small studies that associated low potassium levels with ventricular arrhythmias in the pre-β-blocker and prereperfusion era. Current studies examining the relationship between potassium levels and mortality in AMI patients are lacking.

Objective

To determine the relationship between serum potassium levels and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients in the era of β-blocker and reperfusion therapy.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study using the Cerner Health Facts database, which included 38,689 patients with biomarker-confirmed AMI, admitted to 67 US hospitals between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. All patients had in-hospital serum potassium measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum potassium level (< 3.0, 3.0- < 3.5, 3.5- < 4.0, 4.0- < 4.5, 4.5- < 5.0, 5.0- < 5.5, and ≥ 5.5 mEq/L). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between potassium levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors.

Main Outcome Measures

All-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.

Results

There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum potassium level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8%; 95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%), mortality was comparable for mean postadmission potassium of 4.0 to less than 4.5 mEq/L (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%-5.3%), multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04–1.36). Mortality was twice as great for potassium of 4.5 to less than 5.0 mEq/L (10.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%-10.9%; multivariable-adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.68–2.36), and even greater for higher potassium strata. Similarly, mortality rates were higher for potassium levels of less than 3.5 mEq/L. In contrast, rates of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest were higher only among patients with potassium levels of less than 3.0 mEq/L and at levels of 5.0 mEq/L or greater.

Conclusion

Among inpatients with AMI, the lowest mortality was observed in those with postadmission serum potassium levels between 3.5 and < 4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower potassium levels.

### Potassium homeostasis [^112aMnj7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

5.8 Hyperkalemia

In clinical trials with ALTACE, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving ALTACE. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

With all of these concerns, how do we rectify the competing risks and benefits of RAASi therapy and hyperkalemia in CHF and CKD patients?

Introduction

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level of greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can lead to an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to the risk associated with serum potassium outside the normal range (i.e. below or above normal levels), maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important, as high serum potassium fluctuations are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia and diabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas in a separate investigation in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower (0.3%). Additionally, diabetes is associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which in turn is an independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

Antihypertensive medications, which are frequently prescribed to these patients, can also increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], and drugs that inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (known as potassium-sparing diuretics) are associated with a greater hyperkalemia risk. The combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a potassium-sparing diuretic is likely to further increase potassium levels and has been shown to precipitate life-threatening hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes. Conversely, other diuretics such as thiazides or loop diuretics are generally associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

Older patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to hyperkalemia due to a number of factors, including an age-related decline in renal function and pharmaceutical side effects, such as those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.

### Is transcellular potassium shifting with insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate in emergency department patients with hyperkalemia associated with recurrent hyperkalemia after dialysis? [^117KiXwF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) treatment of hyperkalemia often involves shifting potassium into the intracellular space. There is uncertainty whether transcellular shifting causes insufficient potassium removal during hemodialysis, resulting in a subsequent need for further medical therapy or multiple sessions of hemodialysis.

Objective

We sought to determine whether transcellular potassium shifting in ED patients with hyperkalemia who undergo hemodialysis is associated with recurrent hyperkalemia with or without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational study of ED patients with a potassium value > 5.3 mmol/L and ≥ 1 hemodialysis run. Transcellular shifting medications were defined as albuterol, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate. Primary outcomes were recurrent hyperkalemia with and without repeat hemodialysis within 24 h of the initial dialysis run. Generalized estimating equation models were created for the outcomes using administration of a shifting medication as the primary predictor.

Results

Four hundred seventy-nine encounters were identified. In 238 (50%) encounters, a shifting medication was administered. There were 85 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia and 36 outcomes of recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat hemodialysis. After adjustment, administration of shifting medications was not associated with recurrent hyperkalemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.71–2.23) or recurrent hyperkalemia with repeat dialysis (adjusted odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 0.80–4.48).

Conclusions

Administration of transcellular shifting medications for hyperkalemia in the ED was not associated with either recurrent hyperkalemia after hemodialysis or the need for a second dialysis session within 24 h. Our findings address the uncertainty regarding transcellular potassium shifting before emergent dialysis and support safe ED administration of medications that shift potassium to the intracellular space.

2.2 Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the serum calcium level before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Use of this potassium phosphates in sodium chloride injection product increases the risk of hyperkalemia in adults and pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, including life threatening cardiac events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The rate of administration may be dependent on the patient and the specific institution policy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
When administered peripherally, a generally recommended maximum concentration is phosphorus 6.8 mmol/100 mL (potassium 10 mEq/100 mL).

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Serum and dialysate potassium concentrations and survival in hemodialysis patients [^115GSTUb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Controlling serum potassium is an important goal in maintenance hemodialysis patients. We examined the achievement of potassium balance through hemodialysis treatments and the associated fluctuations in serum potassium.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A 3-yr (July 2001 to June 2004) cohort of 81,013 maintenance hemodialysis patients from all DaVita dialysis clinics across the United States were studied. Nine quarterly-averaged serum potassium groups (< 4.0, ≥ 6.3 mEq/L and seven increments in-between) and four dialysate potassium concentration groups were created in each of the 12 calendar quarters. The death risk associated with predialysis potassium level and dialysate potassium concentration was examined using unadjusted, case-mix adjusted, and malnutrition-inflammation-adjusted time-dependent survival models.

Results

Serum potassium correlated with nutritional markers. Serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mEq/L was associated with the greatest survival, whereas potassium < 4.0 or ≥ 5.6 mEq/L was associated with increased mortality. The death risk of serum potassium ≥ 5.6 mEq/L remained consistent after adjustments. Higher dialysate potassium concentration was associated with increased mortality in hyperkalemic patients with predialysis serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L.

Conclusions

A predialysis serum potassium of 4.6 to 5.3 mEq/L is associated with the greatest survival in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemic patients who undergo maintenance hemodialysis against lower dialysate bath may have better survival. Limitations of observational studies including confounding by indication should be considered when interpreting these results.

### Ramipril [^112cZnAN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen

Increases in creatinine levels occurred in 1.2% of patients receiving ramipril alone, and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 3% of patients receiving ramipril with a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. As ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum potassium can occur. Use potassium supplements and potassium sparing diuretics with caution, and monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].

Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit (a low value and a decrease of 5 g/dL or 5%, respectively) were rare, occurring in 0.4% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril plus a diuretic. No US patients discontinued treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit.

Other (causal relationships unknown)

Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ramipril administration. Elevations of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, uric acid, and blood glucose have been reported, as have cases of hyponatremia and scattered incidents of leucopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. In US trials, less than 0.2% of patients discontinued treatment for laboratory abnormalities; all of these were cases of proteinuria or abnormal liver-function tests.

### The relationship between serum potassium, potassium variability and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients and a before-after analysis on the impact of computer-assisted potassium control [^113gbt6H]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Integration of GRIP-II into our ICU workflow was well accepted by both nurses and physicians. Because potassium regulation was integrated into an already existent glucose control protocol, it did not add any significant nursing time or costs. We consider it a good example of noncritical tasks being successfully delegated to nurses and being computerized. To our knowledge, no other ICUs have yet incorporated GRIP-II, despite its being freely available on the internet. GRIP-II currently operates independently of a Patient Data Management System (PDMS), but the algorithm can also be incorporated into a PDMS. Despite safely reducing the number of patients with hypokalemia and reducing time in hypokalemia and time in hyperkalemia, GRIP-II caused a mild increase in moderate hyperkalemia. Preventing hyperkalemia and hypokalemia through GRIP-II was achieved only by regulating potassium infusion, because other actions to change potassium levels could be prescribed only by the intensivist. Thus, in cases of (impending) hyperkalemia, GRIP-II can only discontinue the potassium infusion. We assumed that this mechanism caused a higher incidence of patients with mild hyperkalemia post-GRIP, although the time in hyperkalemia decreased (Table 4). On the basis of these results, we have recently adjusted the GRIP-II target downwards slightly, from 4.3 mmol/L (in the middle of the 3.5 to 5.0 reference range) to 4.0 mmol/L.

The precise optimal range for desired potassium levels remains unknown. This has been studied in different patient cohorts, varying between 3.5 and 4.5 mmol/L, 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L or even 4.5 and 5.5 mmol/L in acute myocardial infarction and HF patients, with no consensus reached. Currently, 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L is accepted as a safe range for ICU patients. Whether cutoff points for potassium should be more precise and could affect outcome is still unclear.

If deemed sufficiently relevant, a large prospective trial would be required to address these unanswered questions. For example, the researchers in the Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) study, investigated glucose control in a multicenter trial with over 6,000 patients.

### Potassium chloride oral (Potassium chloride) [^112AewMC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

Hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia in children is defined as plasma potassium greater than 5.5 mmol/L. A retrospective study demonstrated that hyperkalemia constitutes nearly 22.4% of SEA cases in children. While plasma K > 7 mmol/L is found in severe hyperkalemia, children with moderate hyperkalemia have plasma potassium within a range of 6–7 mmol/L. Notably, normal potassium levels are higher in newborns and infants due to their lower glomerular filtration rates and partial aldosterone resistance. Pseudohyperkalemia arises from hemolysis and potassium leakage during or after capillary or venous blood collection. This phenomenon is more prevalent in small children, where the use of smaller needles and surrounding tissue squeezing during blood sample collection can contribute to its occurrence. Pseudohyperkalemia also occurs in patients with leukocytosis or blood clotting or may be a consequence of preanalytical errors including improper blood sample storage, delayed analysis, and specimen contamination. It is recommended to repeat hemolyzed hyperkalemia samples to ensure accurate results.

Hyperkalemia most commonly occurs in children with acute kidney injury or ESKD. It can be attributed to various factors including excessive potassium intake, potassium redistribution, tissue injury (mainly skeletal and cardiac muscle), and massive cell lysis (as seen in tumor lysis syndrome). Additionally, it can be caused by decreased potassium excretion due to kidney dysfunction, mineralocorticoid deficiency, aldosterone resistance (such as in renal tubular acidosis type 4), or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The various etiologies of hyperkalemia are demonstrated in Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hyperkalemia is shown in Fig. 4 using a TTGK threshold of greater or less than 6, as evidenced by Choi et al. While hyperkalemia is often asymptomatic, individuals may manifest symptoms such as weakness, muscular paralysis, and respiratory failure. Additional symptoms may be associated with the underlying disease, such as polydipsia and polyuria in diabetic ketoacidosis or failure to thrive in tubular disorders. Early ECG signs of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, progressing to flattened broad P waves, and QRS complex prolongation with increasing potassium concentrations. In severe cases, hyperkalemia may lead to heart block, asystole, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^116XgbM2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes according to potassium level

There was a U‐shaped relationship between baseline potassium level and the clinical outcomes of interest. Patients in the lowest baseline potassium category (≤ 3.5 mmol/L) had higher event rates in comparison with patients with potassium in the normal range (4.1–4.9 mmol/L), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables (Table 2). This was also true for those in the highest potassium category (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in relation to the mortality outcomes, although the magnitude of the elevation in risk was smaller than that seen in the lowest potassium category (Table 2).

Table 2
Events, event rates and hazard ratios for baseline and time‐updated potassium levels for the various outcomes

This overall pattern was generally more pronounced in the time‐updated models. For the primary outcome, the HR for a potassium level of 3.6–4.0 mmol/L was 1.25 (95% CI 1.06–1.47) and the HR for a potassium concentration of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L was 1.91 (95% CI 1.41–2.61), compared with the reference category (potassium 4.1–4.9 mmol/L). The HR for a potassium level of 5.0–5.4 mmol/L was 1.08 (95% CI 0.92–1.27) and for a potassium level of ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was 1.38 (95% CI 1.06–1.78).

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### The burden of hyperkalemia in Germany-a real world evidence study assessing the treatment and costs of hyperkalemia [^114LR5UT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia (HK) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic condition characterized by an increased serum concentration of potassium. Normal values of potassium have a range from 3.5 to 5 mmol/l, and hyperkalemia is defined by a value of ≥ 5.1 mmol/l; some authors prefer a low limit of 5.5 mmol/l.

Clinical symptoms of hyperkalemia are inconstant and unspecific (fatigue, muscular weakness), however, hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmia and heart arrest without pre-occurring clinical signs. The condition of hyperkalemia is usually detected in the context of routine laboratory screening. In the light of possibly life-threatening consequences, a finding of hyperkalemia implies an urgent demand for medical clarification and treatment.

The predominant risk factor of hyperkalemia is advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD ≥ 3 (GFR < 60 ml/min), the decreased ability to excrete potassium, especially in combination with diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure frequently results in recurrent and chronic hyperkalemia. Medication (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-Inhibitors and lifestyle (irregular nutrition and circadian rhythm) are additional risk factors.

The true incidence and prevalence of hyperkalemia in the general population is not known, as there are no population-wide studies that examine it. A retrospective analysis based on a selected Canadian population (≥ 65 years) demonstrates that 2.6% of the individuals from the emergency department and 3.5% of the hospitalized patients were hyperkalemic. Further retrospective US researches deliver similar incidence rates between 2.5 and 3.2%. However, due to the low sensitivity, the true frequency in the general population is assumed to be considerably higher.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Increasing the potassium level in patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias [^1151NvTA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia and even low-normal plasma potassium levels increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias among patients with cardiovascular disease. An assessment of a strategy of actively increasing plasma potassium levels to the high-normal range is needed.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label, event-driven, randomized superiority trial conducted in Denmark, we enrolled participants at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias (defined as those with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) and with a baseline plasma potassium level of 4.3 mmol per liter or lower. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a treatment regimen aimed at increasing the plasma potassium level to a high-normal level (4.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter) by means of potassium supplementation, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or both plus dietary guidance and standard care (high-normal potassium group) or to standard care only (standard-care group). The primary end point was a composite of documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization (> 24 hours) for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis.

Results

Among the 1200 participants who underwent randomization (600 assigned to each group), the median duration of follow-up was 39.6 months (interquartile range, 26.4 to 49.3). A primary end-point event occurred in 136 participants (22.7%; 7.3 events per 100 person-years) in the high-normal potassium group, as compared with 175 participants (29.2%; 9.6 events per 100 person-years) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.95; P = 0.01). The incidence of hospitalization for hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among participants with any cardiovascular disease who had an ICD and were at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, a treatment-induced increase in plasma potassium levels led to a significantly lower risk of appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause than standard care.

### Electrolyte derangements in critically ill children receiving balanced versus unbalanced crystalloid fluid resuscitation [^116GfH6g]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

While the causative nature of these findings cannot be established, the finding that LR, which contains a minimal amount of potassium (4 mEq/L), leads to fewer instances of hyperkalemia than 0.9%NaCl (which contains no potassium) does have a physiologic basis. First, administering LR to a patient with hyperkalemia will dilute the amount of extracellular potassium through a weighted average. For example, a 15 kg patient has a total body water estimated at 10 L, of which one third is extracellular (3.25 L). If this patient has an initial potassium level of 5 mmol/L and receives 60 ml/kg of fluid resuscitation with LR, the extracellular fluid compartment will increase to 4.15 L. In this scenario, the final serum potassium level would actually decrease to 4.78 mmol/L, due to the relatively greater expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment compared to potassium load. Additionally, most of the body's potassium is intracellular, and thus any potassium shifting into the extracellular compartment will lead to an increased serum potassium level. Since the pH of 0.9%NaCl is 5, it can induce a metabolic acidosis, resulting in intracellular shifts of hydrogen ions in exchange for potassium, which increases extracellular potassium levels. This effect has been demonstrated previously in kidney transplant recipients, where patients who received 0.9%NaCl had higher rates of acidosis and hyperkalemia compared to those who received either LR or PL. Our study adds to this body of evidence, as severe acidosis (pH < 7.1) was indeed seen more commonly in patients who received both 0.9%NaCl and mixed fluids, and these same groups also had a higher incidence of severe hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 6 mmol/L) compared to those receiving LR. While it is unclear the reasons these patients developed severe acidosis it is likely multifactorial and includes both the significantly higher volume compared to LR fluids and/or severity of illness.

Fig. 2
Patients with serum potassium (K +) levels (a) ≤ 5.5 mmol/L and (b) ≤ 5.0 mmol/L at various time points

The median time to a serum K + level of ≤ 5.5 mmol/L in the overall population was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1–2.0) h (Table 2). The median time to normalization of serum K + levels to ≤ 5.0 mmol/L was 21.6 (95% CI, 4.1–22.4) h. Although patients with higher baseline serum K + levels experienced longer median times to normalization than patients with lower serum K + levels, all but one patient with baseline serum K + level of > 6.5 mmol/L achieved serum K + ≤ 5.5 mmol/L within 48 h (median time [95% CI], 20.6 [2.2–24.3] h). The median time to achievement of serum K + level ≤ 5.1 mmol/L is presented in Additional file 4: Table S1. When examining the time to achievement of i-STAT K + levels ≤ 5.5, ≤ 5.1, and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, it was found that i-STAT K + goals were achieved in less time than serum K + goals (Additional file 5: Table S2).

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Use of Other Medications that Increase Potassium: Avoid use in patients receiving such products. If use cannot be avoided, closely monitor serum potassium concentrations. (5.3, 7.1)

7.1 Other Products that Increase Serum Potassium

Administration of Potassium Phosphates Injection to patients treated concurrently or recently with products that increase serum potassium (e.g., potassium- sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, digoxin, or the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine) increases the risk of severe and potentially fatal hyperkalemia, in particular in the presence of other risk factors for hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Avoid use of Potassium Phosphates Injection in patients receiving such products. If use cannot be avoided, closely monitor serum potassium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)].

### Enalapril maleate (epaned) [^112mYod2]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

EPANED can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.

In these patients, EPANED should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of EPANED and/or diuretic is increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, EPANED may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be through this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.4 Hepatic Failure

Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

5.5 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function in patients treated with EPANED. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on EPANED. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on EPANED [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving EPANED. Drugs that inhibit the renin angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Potassium chloride and dextrose monohydrate (potassium chloride in dextrose) [^112BzC7J]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.2 Hyperkalemia

Potassium-containing solutions, including Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and/or characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. Cardiac arrhythmias, some fatal, can develop at any time during hyperkalemia.

To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia, do not administer Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection as an intravenous push (i.e., intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access, without quantitative infusion device [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those:

with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, and certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block (especially if they receive digoxin).
with hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergoing correction of alkalosis (conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space).
treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Avoid use of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection in patients with, or at risk for, hyperkalemia. If use cannot be avoided, use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride, infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs.

5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Serum potassium and adverse outcomes across the range of kidney function: a CKD prognosis consortium meta-analysis [^116ABgiW]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Both hypo- and hyperkalaemia can have immediate deleterious physiological effects, and less is known about long-term risks. The objective was to determine the risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and end-stage renal disease associated with potassium levels across the range of kidney function and evaluate for consistency across cohorts in a global consortium.

Methods and Results

We performed an individual-level data meta-analysis of 27 international cohorts [10 general population, 7 high cardiovascular risk, and 10 chronic kidney disease (CKD)] in the CKD Prognosis Consortium. We used Cox regression followed by random-effects meta-analysis to assess the relationship between baseline potassium and adverse outcomes, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, overall and across strata of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We included 1 217 986 participants followed up for a mean of 6.9years. The average age was 55 ± 16years, average eGFR was 83 ± 23mL/min/1.73m2, and 17% had moderate- to-severe increased albuminuria levels. The mean baseline potassium was 4.2 ± 0.4mmol/L. The risk of serum potassium of > 5.5mmol/L was related to lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. The risk relationship between potassium levels and adverse outcomes was U-shaped, with the lowest risk at serum potassium of 4–4.5mmol/L. Compared with a reference of 4.2mmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.29] at 5.5mmol/L and 1.49 (95% CI 1.26–1.76) at 3.0mmol/L. Risks were similar by eGFR, albuminuria, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, and across cohorts.

Conclusions

Outpatient potassium levels both above and below the normal range are consistently associated with adverse outcomes, with similar risk relationships across eGFR and albuminuria.

### Short-term mortality risk of serum potassium levels in hypertension: a retrospective analysis of nationwide registry data [^112GFm2s]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Diuretics and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors are central in the treatment of hypertension, but may cause serum potassium abnormalities. We examined mortality in relation to serum potassium in hypertensive patients.

Methods and Results

From Danish National Registries, we identified 44 799 hypertensive patients, aged 30 years or older, who had a serum potassium measurement within 90 days from diagnosis between 1995 and 2012. All-cause mortality was analysed according to seven predefined potassium levels: < 3.5 (hypokalaemia), 3.5–3.7, 3.8–4.0, 4.1–4.4, 4.5–4.7, 4.8–5.0, and > 5.0 mmol/L (hyperkalaemia). Outcome was 90-day mortality, estimated with multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, with the potassium interval of 4.1–4.4 mmol/L as reference. During 90-day follow-up, mortalities in the seven strata were 4.5, 2.7, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 2.7, and 3.6%, respectively. Adjusted risk for death was statistically significant for patients with hypokalaemia [hazard ratio (HR): 2.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.17–3.62], and hyperkalaemia (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36–2.13). Notably, normal potassium levels were also associated with increased mortality: K: 3.5–3.7 mmol/L (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36–2.13), K: 3.8–4.0 mmol/L (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.00–1.47), and K: 4.8–5.0 mmol/L (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.15–1.92). Thus, mortality in relation to the seven potassium ranges was U-shaped, with the lowest mortality in the interval of 4.1–4.4 mmol/L.

Conclusion

Potassium levels outside the interval of 4.1–4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality risk in patients with hypertension.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^113seKRu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This Danish register‐based cohort study investigated the 90‐day mortality among 7620 patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia in relation to the subsequent plasma potassium measurement. The major findings were: (1) More than one‐third of the patients with initial hyperkalemia persisted with hyperkalemia at a subsequent measurement; (2) potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were associated with increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality; (3) decrease in potassium to levels < 4.1 mmol/L in patients with initial hyperkalemia was associated with increased mortality risk (all‐cause and cardiovascular) compared with the reference (4.1–4.6 mmol/L); (4) aiming for potassium concentrations between 4.1 and 5.5 mmol/L, after an episode of hyperkalemia, was associated with increased survival.

Numerous studies have previously shown the importance of potassium on mortality in different populations with or without cardiovascular disease. 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 However, no prior studies have examined the risk of mortality in patients who persisted with hyperkalemia or who had hypokalemia at the second measurement compared with patients with normal plasma potassium concentrations.

We observed a significantly increased mortality risk among patients who, following an episode of hyperkalemia, had their potassium downregulated to levels < 4.1 mmol/L within 6 to 100 days. This finding was expected considering our previous findings, 3 where we observed an apparent optimal potassium range within 4.1 to 4.7 mmol/L in a similar population. We also observed significant associations with presumed cardiovascular death. Potassium concentrations < 4.1 and > 5.5 mmol/L are associated with both all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, which might suggest that potassium has 2 roles: risk factor and risk marker. In other words, potassium in itself could be responsible for mortality, and potassium abnormalities could identify sicker patients with increased risk of mortality or patients physiologically or genetically "unable" to maintain potassium homeostasis when having concurrent heart disease.

2.2 Risk factors of hyperkalemia

Abnormal serum potassium concentrations represent one of the most important electrolyte disorders in clinical practice. In this regard, potassium plays a critical role in normal cell membrane electrophysiology, with both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia leading to electrophysiological perturbations. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium concentrations can cause life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. The kidneys play a central role in potassium homeostasis. Kidney dysfunction and acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron are among the most important risk factors for hyperkalemia. Accordingly, the main risk factors for hyperkalemia are kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal disease.

An international meta‐analysis of over 1.2 million patients with CKD from 27 different cohorts examined the risk factors leading to hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia correlated strongly with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): a decrease in eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 approximately doubled the risk of hyperkalemia. While lower eGFR was a strong risk factor for hyperkalemia, higher albuminuria was a weaker risk factor. Furthermore, medications such as potassium‐sparing diuretics, MRAs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin antagonists, β‐blockers, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, heparin, and penicillin are associated with hyperkalemia. Potassium supplements and potassium‐based salt substitutes may also be a cause of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with underlying CKD or concomitant use of hyperkalemia‐inducing drugs.

Changes in potassium levels

Figure 3 illustrates the mixed-effects model showing both the measured and predicted potassium values for patients in the Mid-Sweden Cohort treated with first- and second-generation potassium binders. For first-generation binders, baseline potassium levels decreased from 5.7 mmol/L (95% CI: 4.5–6.8) to 4.7 mmol/L (95% CI: 3.6–5.9) by the 15th day following treatment initiation, while for second-generation binders, potassium levels decreased from 5.5 mmol/L (95% CI: 4.3–6.7) to 4.9 mmol/L (95% CI: 3.8–6.1) within the same time period. Following this initial reduction, potassium levels remained stable throughout the remaining 45 days of follow-up. A similar pattern was observed in the as-treated analysis, with potassium levels remaining stable over the follow-up period.

### Population epidemiology of hyperkalemia: cardiac and kidney long-term health outcomes [^1164Cw7N]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The population burden and long-term implications of hyperkalemia have not been comprehensively studied. We studied how often and where hyperkalemia occurs as well as its independent association with survival and long-term cardiac and kidney health.

Study Design

Population-based cohort study of adult residents of Grampian, United Kingdom.

Setting & Participants

Among the 468,594 adult residents (2012–2014), 302,630 people with at least 1 blood test were followed until 2019.

Exposure

Hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. Adjustment for comorbidities, demographics, measures of acute and chronic kidney function, and medications prescribed before measurement of serum potassium.

Outcome

All-cause mortality, cardiac events, and kidney failure.

Analytical Approach

Description of the annual incidence of hyperkalemia and the characteristics associated with its occurrence, and adjusted Cox proportional hazards (PH) analysis to evaluate the independent long-term association of hyperkalemia with all-cause mortality among people who survived ≥ 90 days after blood testing. Cause-specific PH models were fit to evaluate the association of hyperkalemia with cardiac events/death, noncardiac death, and kidney failure. Effect modification by level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of blood testing was explored.

Results

The annual population incidence of hyperkalemia was 0.96 per 100 person-years. This represented 2.3%, 2.1%, and 1.9% of people with at least one blood test in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Two-thirds of episodes of hyperkalemia occurred in the community. The hyperkalemia rate was 2-fold higher for each 10-year greater age. Those with hyperkalemia were 20 times more likely to have concurrent acute kidney injury (AKI), and 17 times more likely to have an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Throughout 5 years of follow-up evaluation (2,483,452 person-years), hyperkalemia was associated with poorer health outcomes. This association held across all levels of kidney function and was irrespective of concurrent AKI, but was stronger among those with a baseline eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P for interaction < 0.001). The adjusted HRs (hyperkalemia vs no hyperkalemia) for people with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2–2.5) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.6) for mortality; 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2–1.6) for cardiac events; and 17.0 (95% CI, 9.3–31.1) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5–2.8) for kidney failure, respectively.

Limitations

The observational nature of this study limits evaluation of causal relationships.

Conclusions

There is a substantial burden of hyperkalemia in the general population. Hyperkalemia is associated with poorer long-term health outcomes, especially kidney outcomes, that are independent of other established risk factors.

### Serum potassium and cause-specific mortality in a large peritoneal dialysis cohort [^113tuq3m]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Unlike hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a continuous therapy and does not induce myocardial stunning. Yet, the death risk in HD and PD patients is similar. This study tested the hypothesis that serum potassium abnormalities contribute more to the death risk in PD patients than in HD patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Data from patients treated in DaVita facilities between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2006 (n = 10,468 PD patients; n = 111,651 HD patients) were used to determine association of serum potassium with mortality.

Results

PD patients were significantly more likely to have serum potassium < 4 mEq/L, with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.30 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.05, 3.56). There was a U-shaped relationship between time-averaged serum potassium and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality of PD patients, with adjusted hazards ratios of 1.51 for all-cause mortality for potassium < 3.5 mEq/L (95% CI, 1.29, 1.76) and 1.52 for potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L (95% CI, 1.32, 1.75). The population-attributable risks for all-cause mortality for serum potassium < 4.0 and ≥ 5.5 mEq/L were 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively, in PD patients, and 0.8% and 1.5%, respectively, in HD patients.

Conclusions

Abnormalities in serum potassium contribute disproportionately to the high death risk in PD patients. This may, in part, account for the equivalent cardiac risk seen with the two therapies.

### Serum potassium and cardiovascular mortality [^115q6VyX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of serum potassium on mortality is inadequately defined.

Objective

To determine the association of serum potassium with mortality.

Methods

We analyzed NHANES I Epidemiological Follow-up Study data from 1974–1992. Of 2,992 subjects with baseline serum potassium, 156 were excluded because their vital status was not known. A total of 2,836 subjects with serum potassium within 2.7–5.4 mmol/L were studied. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed controlling for sociodemographic status, smoking, medical history, and clinical characteristics.

Results

At baseline, mean age was 46.6 years, and mean serum potassium was 4.07 mmol/L. Subjects were stratified into three groups by mean ± 1 standard deviation of serum potassium: low, 2.7–3.7 mmol/L (N = 477); middle, 3.8–4.4 mmol/L (N = 1,982); and high, 4.5–5.4 mmol/L (N = 377). The cardiovascular mortality rate per 1,000 person-years adjusted for age, gender, and race for the high serum potassium group (8.1) was significantly higher than the middle (5.3) and low (6.5) serum potassium groups. Further analysis, controlling for age, gender, race, smoking status, cholesterol, and history of diabetes, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease, revealed that the increased cardiovascular mortality among subjects with moderately increased serum potassium was most prominent in those reporting use of diuretics (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.20 to 5.85) and those with abnormal renal function (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.41).

Conclusion

In this general population sample with mostly normal serum potassium, higher serum potassium was independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.

### Potassium phosphates [^114xZWQf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The 100 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol (phosphorus 0.15 mmol/mL) and potassium 22 mEq (potassium 0.22 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central vein.
The 250 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol and potassium 22 mEq (phosphorus 0.06 mmol/mL and potassium 0.088 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central OR peripheral vein.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia in burn patients treated with intravenous or oral trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other infections: nature or nurture? [^112nuPQe]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim is well known to cause rashes; however, what is not commonly known is that it causes sudden and profound hyperkalemia in 10 to 20% of treated patients. The uniqueness of burn patients begs the question whether changes known to occur in these patients might also increase this trimethoprim effect. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study evaluated 224 patients with thermal injury who had been treated with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 24 of whom had underlying renal impairment (creatinine clearances < 50 ml/min) and were excluded, leaving 200 patients for analysis. Three definitions of drug-induced hyperkalemia were used: 1) a ≥ 1 mEq/L rise, 2) a > 0.8 mEq rise in potassium in < 24 hours warranting early discontinuation of TMP-SMX, and 3) "marked" hyperkalemia defined as serum potassium of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L within 48 hours. A potassium level before trimethoprim exposure (TxK) and after TxK were collected retrospectively. Demographic data were analyzed with Student's t-test and trimethoprim dose alone, demonstrating a significant difference. Analysis of 200 patients exposed to trimethoprim demonstrated an elevation of potassium (first definition) in 31 patients (15.5%), a rapid change in serum potassium in two patients (second definition), and marked hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mEq/L) in 13 patients (6.5%). Hyperkalemia never occurred in 166 of 200 patients (82%; before TxK, 3.9 ± 0.4; after TxK, 4.3 ± 0.5 mEq/L). Change in serum potassium among patients with hyperkalemia was 4.0 ± 0.5 mEq/L before TxK and 5.3 ± 0.7 mEq/L after TxK. Twelve published hyperkalemia risk factors were reviewed in these 200 patients and only history of hypertension and need for intubation was more common in those with hyperkalemia. A nearly 20% incidence of hyperkalemia and 6% serious hyperkalemia in burn patients is consistent with reports in patients without burn injury. These data also suggest that the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with burn injury do not increase further the genetically predisposed hyperkalemia resulting from exposure to trimethoprim. These data suggest patients treated with TMP-SMX should have routine serum potassium monitoring before discharge.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment in patients with renal insufficiency and the associated risk of hyperkalemia and death [^114sKVAW]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study found the rate of hyperkalemia to be higher in patients treated with MRA for all strata of eGFR, with comparable differences between patients treated with and not treated with MRA gradually decreasing with aggravation of renal impairment consistent with an overall greater propensity for hyperkalemia in advanced CKD regardless of MRA exposure. Despite the increased rate of hyperkalemia, subsequent 30-day mortality was comparably lower for patients treated with MRA across all strata of eGFR. Nonetheless, overall unadjusted 30-day mortality was substantial 30.3% (n = 9825), as such underscoring the severity associated with hyperkalemic disturbances.

That patients with higher renal function were found to have higher mortality, which might partly be explained by the smaller proportion of this group having hyperkalemia caused by renal insufficiency and medication thus giving more share to more severe and lethal causes of hyperkalemia, including critical illness, rhabdomyolysis, and necrosis. Another phenomenon that might contribute to the present findings is physiological adaption in CKD. Because patients with CKD are more likely to be exposed to hyperkalemia for a longer period of time, it is suggested that their normal range of potassium levels should be considered higher than in other patients as they adapt to potassium imbalance. This is further supported by studies suggesting that rapid increases in serum potassium, for example, in association to intravenous potassium loading, massive cell turnover or critical illness is more lethal. On the contrary, patients with CKD could be more sensitive to toxicity due to hyperkalemia because of their, a priori, higher risk of other metabolic derangement including hypocalcemia, acidosis, and elevated uremic solutes. However, other studies have shown that despite an increased risk of hyperkalemia, patients with CKD have a reduced 1-day mortality if measured serum potassium at least 5.5 mmol/l compared with patients without CKD, suggesting a better tolerance of hyperkalemia.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Relation of serum potassium level to long-term outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^111MZtUQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Potassium plays a key role in normal myocardial function, and current guidelines recommend that serum potassium levels be maintained from 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the impact of serum potassium levels on long-term mortality has not been evaluated. We retrospectively studied 1,924 patients diagnosed with AMI. The average serum potassium levels measured throughout the hospitalization were obtained and statistically analyzed. Patients were categorized into 5 groups to determine the relation between mean serum potassium and long-term mortality: < 3.5, 3.5 to < 4.0, 4.0 to < 4.5, 4.5 to < 5.0, and ≥ 5 mEq/L. The long-term mortality was lowest in the group of patients with potassium levels of 3.5 to < 4.0 mEq/L, whereas mortality was higher in the patients with potassium levels ≥ 4.5 or < 3.5 mEq/L. In a multivariate Cox-proportional regression analysis, the mortality risk was greater for serum potassium levels of > 4.5 mEq/L (hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 2.81 and HR 4.78, 95% CI 2.14 to 10.69, for patients with potassium levels of 4.5 to < 5.0 mEq/L and ≥ 5.0, respectively) compared with patients with potassium levels of 3.5 to < 4.0 mEq/L. The mortality risk was also higher for patients with potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L (HR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56). In contrast to the association with long-term mortality, there was no relation between serum potassium levels and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The results of the current analysis suggest that there is a need for change in our current concepts of the ideal serum potassium levels in patients with AMI.

On the basis of high-quality observational data, Goyal et al. have found that serum potassium levels < 3.5 mmol/l or ≥ 4.5 mmol/l are associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. We discuss whether target potassium levels in clinical practice and guidelines should be changed to 3.5–4.5 mmol/l.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^116wEk37]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^112RDEXp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure Variable

Normal plasma potassium interval varies within populations. Therefore, different reference intervals are used worldwide. 9, 10, 11 The Nordic Reference Interval Project defines hypokalemia as plasma potassium concentrations < 3.5 mmol/L and hyperkalemia and potassium levels > 4.6 mmol/L. 10

As potassium does not have a linear relationship with mortality, the second potassium measurement was divided into 8 intervals: 2.2 to 2.9 mmol/L, 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/L, 3.5 to 3.7 mmol/L, 3.8 to 4.0 mmol/L, 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L, 4.7 to 5.0 mmol/L, 5.1 to 5.5 mmol/L, and 5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L. Plasma potassium interval 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L was used as the reference for statistical analyses. We chose this interval as the reference group on the basis of the study of Krogager et al 3 and the lowest mortality risk observed in a restricted cubic spline curve (Figure 1).

Figure 1

Outcome

The primary outcome of the study was all‐cause mortality within 90 days of the second plasma potassium measurement occurring 6 to 100 days after the first plasma potassium measurement indicating hyperkalemia. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular death within 90 days of the second potassium measurement.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: systematic review and meta-analyses [^113UUt58]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Optimum potassium intake

This review is the first to attempt to determine an optimum level of potassium intake for affecting health outcomes. Moderate and high quality evidence showed that a higher potassium intake of 90–120 mmol/day reduced blood pressure and was associated with a lower risk of incident stroke. Intake above 120 mmol/day did not seem to have any additional benefit. However, the evidence from the randomised controlled trials and cohort studies in adults was limited in that it did not identify a precise optimal level of potassium intake for maximum health benefits. However, if a person consumes 90 mmol/day or more potassium and the WHO recommended sodium intake of less than 2 g/day, his or her intake would have a molar ratio of sodium to potassium of approximately one to one, a ratio considered beneficial for health. A subgroup analysis of the randomised controlled trials to explore whether different levels of sodium intake influenced the effect of potassium on blood pressure showed no statistically significant difference in the effect estimates among subgroups based on sodium intake. However, the results suggest that potassium may be more effective in reducing blood pressure at higher levels of sodium consumption, consistent with previous findings. The largest benefit was detected when sodium intake was more than 4 g/day, which is the intake of most populations globally, so increased potassium intake should benefit most people in most countries. However, we also found a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure with increased potassium when sodium intake was 2–4 g/day. Therefore, increased potassium can continue to be beneficial in terms of blood pressure even as individuals and populations decrease their sodium intake. Studies examining both nutrients simultaneously support this concept, showing an increased benefit with simultaneous reduction in sodium and increase in potassium compared with changes in one nutrient individually.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112fF8mn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### Associations of serum potassium levels with mortality in chronic heart failure patients [^1137zSfM]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Medication prescribed to patients suffering from chronic heart failure carries an increased risk of impaired potassium homeostasis. We examined the relation between different levels of serum potassium and mortality among patients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

From Danish National registries, we identified 19549 patients with a chronic heart failure diagnosis who had a measurement of potassium within minimum 90days after initiated medical treatment with loop diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers. All-cause mortality was examined according to eight predefined potassium levels: 2.8–3.4mmol/L, 3.5–3.8mmol/L, 3.9–4.1mmol/L, 4.2–4.4mmol/L, 4.5–4.7mmol/L, 4.8–5.0mmol/L, 5.1–5.5mmol/L, and 5.6–7.4mmol/L. Follow-up was 90days from potassium measurement. We estimated the risk of all-cause mortality using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, with normal serum potassium level at 4.2–4.4mmol/L as reference. After 90 days, the mortality in the eight strata was 14.4, 8.0, 6.3, 5.0, 5.8, 7.9, 10.3, and 21.1% respectively. In multivariable adjusted analysis, patients with potassium levels of 2.8–3.4mmol/L [hazard ratio (HR): 3.16; confidence interval (CI): 2.43–4.11], 3.5–3.8mmol/L (HR: 1.62; CI: 1.31–1.99), 3.9–4.1mmol/L (HR: 1.29; CI: 1.08–1.55), 4.8–5.0mmol/L (HR: 1.34; CI: 1.10–1.63), 5.1–5.5mmol/L (HR: 1.60; CI: 1.29–1.97), and 5.6–7.4mmol/L (HR: 3.31; CI: 2.61–4.20) had an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Levels within the lower and upper levels of the normal serum potassium range (3.5–4.1mmol/L and 4.8–5.0mmol/L, respectively) were associated with a significant increased short-term risk of death in chronic heart failure patients. Likewise, potassium below 3.5mmol/L and above 5.0mmol/L was also associated with increased mortality.

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing, or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.
Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:
Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1 /2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).
Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.
Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.
Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw.
Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.
Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.

Aqueous suspension of potassium chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending potassium chloride tablets is not recommended.

To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.

To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.

Laboratory Tests

When blood is drawn for analysis of plasma potassium it is important to recognize that artifactual elevations can occur after improper venipuncture technique or as a result of in vitro hemolysis of the sample.

Drug Interactions

Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (see WARNINGS).

Marked Abnormalities of Serum Potassium ≤ 2.5 and ≤ 3.5 mmol/L

The proportion of patients with a serum potassium level of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L was slightly higher with dapagliflozin 10 mg than placebo in the overall pooled population [5.2% vs. 3.6%, respectively; IRR 1.40 (95% CI 1.05, 1.87); Fig. 5], and for subgroups of patients in the pooled population receiving thiazide diuretics [7.9% vs. 6.7%; IRR 1.24 (95% CI 0.73, 2.11)] or loop diuretics [7.4% vs. 5.3%; IRR 1.56 (95% CI 0.65, 3.93)].

Fig. 5
Incidence rate ratio of marked abnormalities of serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L. Asterisks short-term pooled data up to 24 weeks. CI confidence interval, DAPA dapagliflozin, IRR incidence rate ratio

Few marked abnormalities of potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L were reported as AEs [9 (0.4%) vs. 4 (0.2%) with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. placebo, respectively]. None of these AEs resulted in discontinuation and the majority were mild in intensity [8 (0.3%) with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. 2 (0.1%) with placebo], with no severe events reported. In total, 6 (0.3%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 1 (< 0.1%) patient in the placebo group had an AE of hypokalemia that required intervention.

There were no reports of a serum potassium level of ≤ 2.5 mmol/L in the pooled population.

Table 3
HRs for Clinical Outcomes 6 Months After Hyperkalemia Versus Fully Matched Comparisons Without Hyperkalemia

When restricted to the subcohort of patients with chronic HF, incidences of hyperkalemia increased less steeply during early follow‐up, but total hyperkalemia incidence rates were close to those in all patients with HF, with similar risk factors, whereas outcome RRs after hyperkalemia were less high (Tables S5 through S7). When repeating analyses using 5 random potassium tests per person (Tables S8 through S10), incidences of hyperkalemia were modestly reduced versus the main analysis (1‐year cumulative incidence decreased from 25.2% to 20.9%), risk factor estimates were similar, and outcome associations with hyperkalemia were weaker (eg, adjusted HR for acute‐care hospitalization, 1.99 [main analysis, 2.75]; adjusted HR for intensive care unit, 3.18 [main analysis, 5.12)]. When repeating analyses for those with initial HF as primary diagnosis, all results remained robust and were similar to the main analysis (Tables S11 through S13). The associations between hyperkalemia and clinical outcomes were generally stronger when potassium was measured on in‐hospital days than out‐of‐hospital days (Tables S14 and S15) and in patients with ≥ 10 potassium tests than in patients with < 10 potassium tests (Tables S16 and S17). Finally, when quantifying the influence of potential unmeasured confounding (Figure S1), we found that to explain an adjusted HR of ≈2.0 for acute‐care hospitalizations associated with hyperkalemia, a confounder that was 4 times more frequent among patients with hyperkalemia, compared with patients without hyperkalemia, would need to increase the hazard of acute‐care hospitalization by a factor of ≥ 10 to explain our findings fully (if no increased hazard actually existed).

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^116Wgwwh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a common condition in patients with comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) or congestive heart failure (HF). Moreover, severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that is associated with a higher risk of adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Currently, data regarding the prognostic implications of chronic hyperkalaemia are available; however, information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the trajectory of potassium measurements in patients with acute hyperkalaemia and long-term all-cause mortality.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study that included patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia [potassium (K) > 6mEq/L] without haemolysis in the emergency room of Dr Peset University Hospital in Valencia, Spain searching the lab database from January 2016 to March 2017. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modelling.

Results

We found 172 episodes of acute hyperkalaemia in 160 patients in the emergency room. The mean ± standard deviation age of the sample was 77 ± 12years and 60.5% were males. The most frequent comorbidities were CKD (71.2%), HF (35%) and diabetes mellitus (56.9%). Only 11.9% of the patients were on chronic dialysis. A quarter of the patients did not have previous CKD, making hyperkalaemia an unpredictable life-threatening complication. During the acute episode, mean potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 6.6 ± 0.6 (range 6.1–9.2) mEq/L and 23 ± 16 (range 2–84) mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 17.3 (2.2–23.7) months, 68 patients died (42.5%). Recurrences of hyperkalaemia (K > 5.5mEq/L) were detected in 39.5% of the patients who were monitored during follow-up. We found that previous potassium levels during an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode were not predictors of mortality. Conversely, the post-discharge longitudinal trajectories of potassium were able to predict all-cause mortality (overall P = 0.0015). The effect of transitioning from hyperkalaemia to normokalaemia (K > 5.5 mEq/L to K ≤ 5.5 mEq/L) after the acute episode was significant, and inversely associated with the risk of mortality.

Conclusions

Potassium levels prior to a severe hyperkalaemic event do not predict mortality. Conversely, following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia, serial kinetics of potassium trajectories predict the risk of death. Further evidence is needed to confirm these findings and clarify the optimal long-term management of these patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to patients on hemodialysis, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate standard medical therapies to lower serum potassium in hemodialysis patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) if dialysis is not immediately available.

### Olmesartan medoxomil (Benicar) [^112ADmXZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Benicar. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Benicar [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of Benicar in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.

5.5 Sprue-like Enteropathy

Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider alternative antihypertensive therapy in cases where no other etiology is identified.

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving Benicar. Drugs that inhibit the renin angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Dextrose and potassium chloride (Potassium chloride in dextrose) [^1116MpSu]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.2 Hyperkalemia

Potassium-containing solutions, including Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and/or characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. Cardiac arrhythmias, some fatal, can develop at any time during hyperkalemia.

To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia, do not administer Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection as an intravenous push (i.e., intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access, without quantitative infusion device [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those:

with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, and certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block (especially if they receive digoxin).
with hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergoing correction of alkalsis (conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space).
treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Avoid use of Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients with, or at risk for, hyperkalemia. If use cannot be avoided, use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride, infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^1151uKiB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have demonstrated a U‐shaped relationship between potassium level and mortality in a variety of patient populations. 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18 Colombo et al 2 performed a meta‐analysis of 12 studies examining the relationship between serum potassium levels and mortality in 60 547 patients with acute myocardial infarction, demonstrating higher short‐ and long‐term mortality in patients with serum potassium < 3.5 or ≥ 4.5 mEq/L. Similarly, patients with hypokalemia in our study had higher unadjusted in‐hospital mortality, although we did not find an association between hypokalemia and adjusted in‐hospital mortality or postdischarge mortality. Younis et al 1 noted an independent association between admission potassium levels > 5.5 mEq/L and long‐term mortality in 4031 patients hospitalized with HF. These data support an association between hyperkalemia (admission serum potassium ≥ 5 mEq/L) with higher adjusted in‐hospital and postdischarge mortality in a broad spectrum of acutely ill cardiac patients. We also observed a positive association between potassium variability (based on the maximum and minimum potassium levels) and in‐hospital mortality.

Hypokalemia was associated with higher rates of ventricular arrhythmias in the meta‐analysis by Colombo et al. 2 In our study, patients with hypokalemia more frequently had discharge diagnoses of arrhythmias, including AF, VT, and VF. The Colombo et al 2 systematic review suggested an optimal serum potassium level of 3.5 to 4.4 mEq/L, reflecting disagreement amongst included studies. In our study, the lowest in‐hospital mortality was observed in patients with admission potassium 4 to 4.4 mEq/L, except in those with HF, in whom the lowest death rate was observed in patients with admission potassium levels between 3.5 and 3.9 mEq/L. While we found lower mortality in the majority of patients at an admission serum potassium level ≥ 4.0 mEq/L, these data do not allow specific recommendations to be made regarding target levels for potassium repletion.

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Deep tendon reflexes may be affected by extremes of potassium levels and are an important part of the physical examination. Calcium chloride must be administered through a central line, whereas 20 to 40 mEq per L of potassium per hour may be initially administered via two proximally placed, large-bore peripheral lines, if tolerated. However, the traditionally taught formula that 10 mEq per L of intravenous potassium replacement increases serum potassium by 0. 1 mEq per L is a great memory tool, it is not valid for extreme hypokalemia, as demonstrated by the Segal equation. Although not currently in the guidelines, more recent data support the following: All hospitalized patients should maintain a potassium level between 3. 5 and 5 mEq per L instead of 4 to 5 mEq per L based on large cohort studies showing no difference in all-cause in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit transfers, ventricular fibrillation, cardiovascular death, or cardiac arrest. 5 For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and without metabolic acidosis, use lactated ringers instead of normal saline to avoid further transcellular shifts from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis, consider the addition of isotonic bicarbonate solution. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. 1 The literature does suggest differing recommendations for targeted goal serum potassium of
3. 5 vs. 4 to 5 mEq per L.

We chose to highlight the recommendation for patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure because this is the area with the strongest available evidence; however, its limitations are reflected in the Strength of Recommendation evidence rating of B. The references used in your letter examined potassium levels in patients with myocardial infarction. One reference only included patients with acute heart failure exacerbation. The literature on emergent management of hypokalemia is limited. During our review, we found no recommendations for an analogous hyperkalemia management technique to stabilize the cardiac membrane. Rather, electrolytes are aggressively corrected, and magnesium sulfate is administered as part of the comprehensive treatment of torsades de pointes, but not prevention.
