## Question

A 7-month-old with fever and emesis had a catheterized urinalysis showing protein, leukocytes, and trace blood, so the ER started Keflex; the urine culture was negative. I'm stopping the antibiotics — should I repeat the urinalysis because the dip was abnormal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a repeat urinalysis is needed in a 7‑month‑old who had an initially abnormal catheterized urinalysis but now has a negative urine culture and is stopping empiric cephalexin, and specifically whether the UA should be repeated simply because it was initially abnormal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how much weight to give the negative culture from a catheterized specimen. Then, I should review the limitations and false positives of urinalysis in infants. Next, I will check pediatric guideline recommendations on diagnosing UTI and whether they endorse repeating UA after a negative culture. After that, I should consider antibiotic stewardship and the risks of unnecessary repeat testing. Finally, I will outline appropriate follow‑up and any exceptions where a repeat UA would be reasonable.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor here: a properly collected catheterized urine with a negative culture is highly reliable for excluding a bacterial UTI, and culture is the definitive test clinicians use to confirm or refute UTI, superseding screening abnormalities on UA or dipstick, particularly in young children where specificity of screening can be limited [^115WLzwX] [^111uq4Jt].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the initial abnormal UA in this age group before I jump to conclusions about repeating it. Urinalysis abnormalities such as leukocyte esterase, pyuria, trace blood, and transient protein can occur without true infection and are not specific, especially around febrile illnesses in pediatrics; false positives and sterile pyuria are well described and even common in low-prevalence settings, which is why UA serves as a screen and culture adjudicates the diagnosis [^1126CRh8] [^notfound] [^114xdFbb].

> Hold on, I should verify whether antibiotic timing could falsely sterilize the culture and create a misleading negative. Best practice is to obtain cultures before starting antibiotics because therapy can reduce culture yield; ED and guideline workflows emphasize obtaining appropriate cultures prior to antibiotics when UTI with systemic features is suspected, and management principles across IDSA guidance prioritize acting on the culture once available, which in this case argues strongly against ongoing UTI when the culture is negative despite an initially abnormal UA [^1136chf8] [^112gtP1T].

> Next, I need to check pediatric guideline language about diagnosis and whether any recommend repeating a UA when the culture is negative. ACEP guidance for 2 months to 2 years treats a positive UA as preliminary only and requires culture for a definitive diagnosis; AAP fever pathways in younger infants similarly use UA as a screen and culture to confirm UTI; none of these guidelines suggest repeating the UA after a negative culture in a clinically improving child, and diagnosis and treatment decisions are guided by the culture rather than by normalizing the screening test [^112R1AoS] [^113ujYMg] [^112C4huy] [^117W6oQy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, my first instinct was to consider repeating the UA to ensure the dip normalizes, but that would risk overdiagnosis and overtreatment; I should double‑check stewardship data. Unnecessary repeat urine testing drives treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and false positives, increasing antibiotic use without benefit, and stewardship initiatives consistently recommend avoiding downstream antibiotics based solely on abnormal screening tests in the absence of a corroborating culture or symptoms, which supports not repeating a UA just because it was previously abnormal when the definitive culture is negative [^111M9qMy] [^112BDTaY] [^113xWmwd].

> I will now examine the appropriate follow‑up approach. If the infant is clinically improving and afebrile with good intake, no further urine testing is needed; if fever or concerning features persist or recur, the next step is to reassess for alternative sources of illness and only reconsider urine testing if new urinary signs emerge, aligning with primary care guidance for febrile children in this age range that emphasizes targeted evaluation rather than routine repeat UA after a negative culture [^117CSav9].

> But wait, what if there is persistent microscopic hematuria or proteinuria unrelated to infection; I need to ensure I do not miss a separate renal issue. Persistent hematuria or proteinuria outside the context of acute illness follows different pathways, where repeat urinalysis at a defined interval and risk‑stratified evaluation can be appropriate; that said, those adult‑focused hematuria guidelines are not designed for a 7‑month‑old, so in infants persistent abnormalities would prompt pediatric follow‑up rather than reflexive immediate repeat in the setting of a negative culture for UTI [^111QMmz7] [^112YRYTT].

> Final answer and rationale: No, a repeat urinalysis is not recommended solely because the initial catheterized UA was abnormal when the definitive urine culture is negative and antibiotics are being stopped; the negative culture reliably excludes bacterial UTI, UA abnormalities are nonspecific and often transient, pediatric pathways use culture to confirm diagnosis, and repeating UA risks false positives and unnecessary antibiotics; instead, monitor clinically and reassess only if symptoms persist or new urinary features arise [^116gHYk5] [^1126CRh8] [^112R1AoS] [^111M9qMy].

No, you do not need to **repeat the urinalysis** for this 7-month-old with fever and emesis whose catheterized urine showed protein, leukocytes, and trace blood, and whose urine culture was negative. The initial urinalysis likely reflects transient inflammation or contamination [^1126CRh8], and **a negative culture rules out UTI**. Stop **antibiotics** and monitor clinically; **repeat urinalysis only if symptoms persist** or new urinary symptoms develop [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of abnormal urinalysis with negative culture

- **Leukocyte esterase and proteinuria**: These can reflect transient inflammation, fever, dehydration, or contamination, especially in young children [^1126CRh8].

- **Trace hematuria**: Commonly transient and benign in children; often from minor trauma, fever, or contamination [^1126CRh8].

- **Negative culture**: Strongly argues against UTI, especially with a properly collected catheterized specimen [^112R1AoS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AAP guidelines recommend obtaining a urinalysis and culture in well-appearing febrile infants 8–60 days old and **treating only when the culture is positive**. ACEP guidance for febrile infants 2 months to 2 years similarly advises obtaining a urinalysis and culture when UTI is suspected and **treating only if the culture is positive**. IDSA guidelines recommend **against treating asymptomatic bacteriuria** or an abnormal urinalysis in the absence of a positive culture.

---

## Clinical decision-making in this case

In this case, protein, leukocytes, and trace blood on the initial urinalysis most likely reflect **transient inflammation or contamination** [^1126CRh8]. The negative culture effectively **rules out UTI** [^112R1AoS], so **antibiotics should be stopped** and the child observed. Repeat urinalysis is reserved for **persistent or recurrent fever** or the emergence of new urinary symptoms [^117CSav9].

---

## Potential risks of unnecessary repeat urinalysis

- **False positives**: Repeat testing can yield false positives, leading to unnecessary antibiotics and interventions [^114mXspZ] [^112BDTaY].

- **Antibiotic overuse**: Unnecessary antibiotics increase resistance and adverse effects [^1126oELy] [^113xWmwd].

- **Parental anxiety**: Unnecessary testing can increase anxiety and healthcare use.

---

## When to consider repeat urinalysis

Repeat urinalysis is indicated only if:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Fever, emesis, or new urinary symptoms persist or recur.

- **Clinical deterioration**: The child's condition worsens or new symptoms develop.

- **High-risk factors**: Known urinary tract anomalies or immunocompromise [^117CSav9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The initial abnormal urinalysis likely reflects transient inflammation or contamination, and the negative culture **rules out UTI**. Stop **antibiotics** and monitor clinically; **repeat urinalysis only if symptoms persist** or new urinary symptoms develop.

### Abnormal urinalysis results are common, regardless of specimen collection technique, in women without urinary tract infections [^114mXspZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Voided urinalysis to test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is prone to false-positive results for a number of reasons. Specimens are often collected at triage from women with any abdominal complaint, creating a low UTI prevalence population. Improper collection technique by the patient may affect the result. At least four indices, if positive, can indicate UTI.

- **Objective**: We examine the impact of voided specimen collection technique on urinalysis indicators of UTI and on urine culture contamination in disease-free women.

- **Methods**: In this crossover design, 40 menstrual-age female emergency department staff without UTI symptoms collected urine two ways: directly in a cup ("non-clean") and midstream clean catch ("ideal"). Samples underwent standard automated urinalysis and culture. Urinalysis indices and culture contamination were compared.

- **Results**: The proportion of abnormal results from samples collected by "non-clean" vs. "ideal" technique, respectively, were: leukocyte esterase (> trace) 50%, 35% (95% confidence interval for difference -6% to 36%); nitrites (any) 2.5%, 2.5% (difference -2.5 to 2.5%); white blood cells (> 5/high-powered field [HPF]) 50%, 27.5% (difference 4 to 41%); bacteria (any/HPF) 77.5%, 62.5%, (difference -7 to 37%); epithelial cells (> few) 65%, 30% (difference 13 to 56%); culture contamination (> 1000 colony-forming units of commensal or > 2 species) 77%, 63% (difference -5 to 35%). No urinalysis index was positively correlated with culture contamination.

- **Conclusion**: Contemporary automated urinalysis indices were often abnormal in a disea…

In order to exclude a urinary tract infection, we performed a blood analysis and a urine dipstick/culture. Both examinations were normal (red blood cell count of 114 g/L, white cell count of 6.6×10⁹/L, C-reactive protein 12.7 mg/L, creatinine 47 µmol/L). Nephrolithiasis and appendicitis were ruled out by an abdominal ultrasonography. Obstetrical ultrasonography showed a viable fetus corresponding to the weeks of amenorrhoea; however, the adnexa were not described initially. The patient left our emergency unit with laxatives for suspected constipation.

Four days later, she returned to our emergency unit with severe abdominal pain. At clinical examination, she showed signs of peritoneal irritation. We repeated laboratory exams. Blood tests revealed a decrease in haemoglobin value (101 g/L vs 114 g/L), although the white cell blood count was stable. Ultrasonography showed an ongoing intrauterine pregnancy as well as a poorly vascularised left para-uterine 7×5 cm mass (Figure 1) sensitive to probe passage.

### Cefoxitin [^114Quydz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In adults, the usual dosage range for cefoxitin is 1 gram to 2 grams every 6 to 8 hours. The dosage should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of the infection, and the condition of the patient. It is important to note that if C. trachomatis is suspected as a pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, as cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

Cefoxitin for injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function, with the following dosage adjustments:

- **Loading dose for adults with renal insufficiency**: An initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage may be used as a guide.

	- **Serum creatinine conversion to creatinine clearance**: If only serum creatinine levels are available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) can be used:
		- **Males**: Weight (kg) x (140 - age) / (72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL))
		- **Females**: 0.85 x above value.

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis session, and the maintenance dose should be administered as indicated.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to protect against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. In cases of staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^116YcwNV]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

We excluded individuals where antibiotic treatment is more definitely indicated, such as children, men, pregnant women, and patients with pyelonephritis. Additionally, those with nausea, vomiting, or other severe systemic symptoms, and women aged over 75 were excluded due to a different pattern of symptom reporting. Patients with psychotic illnesses, dementia, or those requiring terminal care were also excluded, as they might be unable to complete the diary.

General practitioners or practice nurses recruited patients with suspected urinary tract infections. The practitioner recorded baseline symptoms, clinical information, age, sex, and postcode, and noted whether antibiotics were prescribed. All patients were asked to provide a fresh sample of midstream urine. Each patient kept a daily diary of symptoms, grading severity for up to 14 days: 0 (no symptoms), 1 (very slight problem), 2 (slight problem), 3 (moderately bad problem), 4 (bad problem), 5 (very bad problem), or 6 (as bad as it could be). The symptoms recorded in the diary — dysuria, haematuria, frequency during day and night, "smelly urine", "tummy pain", generally feeling unwell, and restriction of daily activities — were selected based on common presenting symptoms of urinary tract infections. This diary had been previously validated and shown to be sensitive to change for other acute infections.

Patients were also phoned by the research assistant after three days to ensure there were no issues with completing the questions. However, they were not asked about compliance or to return to the surgery, as this could alter the study results.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^111SCEVi]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

These results support the hypothesis that treating painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with long-term antimicrobial courses is effective. These data support a mounting body of evidence that painful LUTS may have an infectious etiology when dipstick and microbiological culture results do not indicate disease. The standard laboratory tests used to diagnose infection were positive only in a small proportion of the clinic's symptomatic population (< 20%). This result is not surprising as we do not use mid-stream urine (MSU) cultures to initiate treatment, and the insensitivity of urine culture is now well recognized.

An unplanned cessation of treatment in an unselected group of patients with chronic painful LUTS managed with protracted antimicrobial courses was coincident with a measurable deterioration in symptoms. The reintroduction of the original treatment regimen was associated with improvement. Only 24-hour urinary frequency was unaffected. Arguing against a mere placebo effect or a by-product of the stress induced by the clinic suspension, the inflammatory biomarker pyuria mirrored the rise and fall of symptoms in these patients. Similarly, shed urothelial cell counts, which are known to reflect a host innate response to inflammation, moved in concert with the other variables, thus supporting a growing awareness of their ability to reflect the disease process.

A subset of the patients was hospitalized during the suspension period, and the underlying reasons for admission highlight worsening urinary infection, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis, in the face of antibiotic withdrawal.

### Febrile infants ≤ 60 days old with positive urinalysis results and invasive bacterial infections [^115oPCCT]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of febrile infants ≤ 60 days old with positive urinalysis results and invasive bacterial infections (IBI).

We performed a planned secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of febrile infants ≤ 60 days old with IBI who presented to 11 emergency departments from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2016. For this subanalysis, we included infants with IBI and positive urinalysis results. We analyzed the sensitivity of high-risk past medical history (PMH) (prematurity, chronic medical condition, or recent antimicrobial receipt), ill appearance, and/or abnormal white blood cell (WBC) count (≥ 15000 cells/μL) for the identification of IBI.

Of 148 febrile infants with positive urinalysis results and IBI, 134 (90.5%) had bacteremia without meningitis, and 14 (9.5%) had bacterial meningitis (11 with concomitant bacteremia). Thirty-five infants (23.6%) with positive urinalysis results and IBI did not have urinary tract infections. The presence of high-risk PMH, ill appearance, and/or abnormal WBC count had a sensitivity of 53.4% (95% confidence interval: 45.0–61.6) for identification of IBI. Of the 14 infants with positive urinalysis results and concomitant bacterial meningitis, 7 were 29 to 60 days old. Six of these 7 infants were ill-appearing or had an abnormal WBC count. The other infant had bacteremia with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis after antimicrobial pretreatment and was treated for meningitis.

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^113UfcNV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections, including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin — the prohormone of calcitonin — has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections, across settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards, and intensive care units (ICUs).

- **Objectives**: The aim of this systematic review, based on individual patient data, was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011), and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received antibiotic treatment based either on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^112NZrMu]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms began, on average, three days prior to consultation (interquartile range 3–7), with 13% (63/478) of patients experiencing symptoms for more than 10 days. The previous symptom duration did not predict the duration after consultation nor alter estimates of antibiotic resistance.

Table 1 illustrates the mean duration of more severe symptoms, defined as days when any diary-recorded symptom was rated moderately bad or worse, after consultation. The most common symptom, rated as moderately bad, was daytime frequency (397 patients, 78%). More than half also rated dysuria, urgency, and nocturia as moderately bad problems. Notably, 241 patients (47%) felt considerably unwell, and 214 (42%) rated activity restriction as a moderately bad problem or worse. Daytime frequency was the symptom with the longest duration. However, most other symptoms lasted three days on average when rated as moderately bad. About 6% (38) of women did not rate any symptoms as moderately bad or worse, while 8% (55) reported experiencing a week or more of moderately bad symptoms post-consultation.

Among those without a confirmed urinary tract infection, labeled as having "urethral syndrome", symptom severity mirrored those with a confirmed infection.

When controlling for confounding variables, patients with antibiotic-resistant organisms experienced symptoms rated as moderately bad 50–60% longer compared to those with antibiotic-sensitive organisms.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^111oBfVB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The ACEP 2016 guidelines for diagnostic investigations in febrile infants, specifically concerning urine tests, recommend considering a positive test result of urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain to make a preliminary diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^1163dY5q]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

This novel approach requires clinic-based fresh urine microscopy to quantify pyuria, full doses of urinary antibiotic, protracted treatment periods, and careful safety monitoring. Although some patients (20%) could be discharged after only six months, we found that it took an average of 383 days [95% confidence interval (CI) = 337–428] to achieve symptom resolution (mean reduction in validated symptom score = 70%) without the need for further antibiotic treatment. A reduction in symptoms and pyuria associated with antibiotic treatment, followed by deterioration in both measures on early treatment cessation, provided additional cogent observational evidence of efficacy.

Despite positive preliminary data, this therapeutic approach contravenes guidelines for treating acute urinary infection and recognized treatment regimens for recurrent urinary tract infection (reUTI). It also defies antibiotic stewardship policies. The evolution of this treatment method has been supported by a long-running translational research programme and basic scientific activity at University College London. As such, the clinical approach has been founded on peer-reviewed preclinical and clinical research in addition to the systematic collection of efficacy and safety data through surveillance. Nevertheless, the nature of the treatment generated understandable concern among medical managers within the host NHS trust and primary care commissioners.

In September 2015, a patient being managed with nitrofurantoin, having failed numerous attempts to withdraw this agent over 30 months, developed a rare, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis.

### Clinical features of the neutropenic host: Definitions and initial evaluation [^113586S9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The initial evaluation of patients with febrile neutropenia includes a thorough history and physical examination. This includes a complete blood cell count and measurement of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, transaminases, and C-reactive protein. Cultures of blood samples from a peripheral vein and/or catheter are crucial. Chest radiography is indicated for patients showing respiratory signs or symptoms.

Signs and symptoms of inflammation may be minimal or absent. However, a search should be undertaken in the sites most commonly infected, including the periodontium, pharynx, lower esophagus, lung, perineum, eyes, and skin. Blood samples, including those from catheter lumens, if present, and a peripheral vein, should be obtained for cultures for bacteria and fungi.

Urine culture is indicated in the presence of signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection, a urinary catheter in place, or abnormal urinalysis results. Fever is defined as a single axillary temperature measurement of ≥ 37.5 degrees C (oral temperature of ≥ 38.0 degrees C). Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of < 1000 cells/mm³.

### Dysuria: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^115TVrxC]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, particularly with respect to urinalysis, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a urinalysis in patients with dysuria to determine the cause. This is especially important in patients with recurrent UTIs, when there is suspicion of a complicated UTI, and to prevent repeat encounters and additional courses of antibiotics.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^1126w3Gb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with mental status changes were more frequently seen in the emergency room (ER) compared to outpatient settings, with 7% (14/209) in the ER versus 2% (17/740) in outpatient offices, indicating a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003). The characteristics of these patients, including age, lack of vaginal symptoms, rates of cultures taken, and rates of positive cultures, did not significantly differ between the ER and outpatient settings.

Of note, among patients who did not report any urinary symptoms — such as dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, or urinary urgency, making up 39% of all UTI-coded encounters (n = 373/949) — a substantial 95% (60/63) who presented to the ER received antibiotic treatment for UTIs. This rate was significantly higher than the 27% (84/310) observed in outpatient settings (p < 0.001). In the ER, patients without urinary symptoms were more likely to present with mental status changes (18%, 11/63) compared to those seen in outpatient offices (4%, 13/310, p < 0.001). Additionally, these patients were more likely to receive a urinary culture as part of their evaluation, with 92% (58/63) in the ER and 71% (221/310) in outpatient offices (p = 0.001). While the rate of culture positivity was higher in the ER (43%, 27/63) compared to the outpatient setting (30%), this difference was not statistically significant.

### Phexxi [^111qugLg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis: Among 2,804 subjects who received Phexxi in Studies 1 and 2, 0.36% (n = 10) reported adverse reactions of cystitis, pyelonephritis, or other upper urinary tract infections (UTI). Of these, one case of pyelonephritis was considered serious and required hospitalization. Avoid the use of Phexxi in females of reproductive potential with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection or urinary tract abnormalities.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: A randomized controlled trial [^1136chf8]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinalysis and urine culture, along with an antibiotic resistance profile, were performed upon admission. In patients with febrile UTI, blood cultures were taken prior to the administration of antibiotics.

To determine microbiological cure and recurrence rates, urinalysis and urine culture were performed on day 7 after the end of therapy and day 30 after enrollment. Patients were instructed in the collection of midstream urine for urinalysis and urine culture. These urine specimens were sent by mail and reached the laboratory within 48 hours.

- **Outcomes and follow-up**: All endpoints were assessed at discharge from the hospital and 30 and 90 days after enrollment through standardized telephone interviews by blinded members of the study team.

The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Each day of antibiotic therapy for any indication was counted as a full day of antibiotic exposure.

Secondary endpoints included the duration of the initial antibiotic therapy; overall rate of recurrence, defined as any re-treated UTI; overall rate of rehospitalization for any cause within 90 days after enrollment; rate of persistent infection 7 days after the end of therapy, defined as recovery of the initial uropathogen in the returned urine culture plus pyuria > 20 leucocytes/μL in the concomitant urinalysis; and rate of persistent symptomatic infection 30 days after enrollment, defined as recovery of the initial uropathogen in the returned urine culture plus pyuria > 20 leucocytes/μL in the concomitant urinalysis plus symptoms of a UTI in the 30-day phone interview.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^115chpcP]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

However, there are some important limitations. While we attempted to capture only simple UTIs (defined using primary care morbidity coding, but not excluding those with a history of more complex urological pathology) in our main analysis, we may have included patients with underlying urinary tract disorders or other infections. Since different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed for different clinical scenarios, some degree of confounding by indication is unavoidable. However, we were able to reduce confounding by robustly defining and adjusting for variables that may have influenced the choice of antibiotic drug prescribed, such as baseline renal function. As trimethoprim was less frequently prescribed for patients with urological pathology, this would likely have led to underestimating the odds of adverse outcomes, particularly acute kidney injury, for trimethoprim compared with the true result. Similarly, clinicians may have been cautious in prescribing trimethoprim to those at highest risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, again leading to an underestimation of the true risk of adverse outcomes, particularly for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, the strongest evidence of adverse outcomes in association with trimethoprim use for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers was only published towards the end of the period of this study.

Our assessment of antibiotic exposure was based on prescriptions alone, and patients may not have collected or taken their medicine. This may have led to differential misclassification owing to the s

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: A retrospective cohort study [^114Mzq4v]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we show that urine leukocytes effectively reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in febrile young (0–89 day old) infants with bacteriuria. Reassuringly, we find low odds of invasive sepsis by uropathogens even when urinary tract infections — the most common serious bacterial infections at this age — are missed at the initial visit due to few leukocytes in urine. The low risk of invasive sepsis in bacteriuric infants with 'normal' screening urinalysis mitigates a major limitation of this test — its modest tendency to miss urinary tract infections — and indicates that fever management strategies reported in the literature that rely on urinalysis for screening are likely to be safe in selected febrile, well-appearing young infants managed on an outpatient basis with assured close follow-up.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes such as protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones.

- **Objective**: To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells due to urine strip shortages.

- **Design**: During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose, and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed two labels so nursing staff would collect two specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding the absence of usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

- **Results**: The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period, we had only one complaint from a physician wanting more specific results.

### Reducing antibiotic overuse: A call for a national performance measure for not treating asymptomatic bacteriuria [^1126oELy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Positive urinary tract culture results often represent asymptomatic bacteriuria, which does not need to be treated with antimicrobial agents. Avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults should reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance and is consistent with the Infectious Diseases Society of America and US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on bacteriuria. A similar approach for not treating upper respiratory illnesses with antibiotics was initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We propose that a hospital and ambulatory performance measure should be developed for not treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults. In addition, such an effort would aid hospitals in confronting the proposal of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (to be implemented in 2009) to not pay the expenses associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113vvdoH]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Screening urinalysis is only moderately sensitive and has been reported to miss approximately 20% of urinary tract infections in febrile young infants. The concern, when this occurs, is that infants with missed urinary tract infections due to normal screening urinalysis results may progress to septicemia or bacterial meningitis from concomitant bacteremia unrecognized at the initial visit. We show in this study that this concern is unwarranted for the most part because urine leukocytes are an adequate screen for bacteriuric sepsis. Specifically, we find that few leukocytes in urine and a negative urine dipstick result at the initial visit reflect a low risk of concomitant sepsis in young infants when a urinary pathogen is unexpectedly isolated from culture.

Other plausible markers of bona fide urinary tract infections, such as the concentration of bacteria in urine, also differ significantly between bacteriuric infants with low and high leukocytes in urine, supporting categorization into separate clinical groups. Based on these differences and the relatively low risk of concomitant sepsis observed in the present study, it appears safe to manage febrile young infants who are well-appearing and have few leukocytes in urine on an outpatient basis, as recommended in clinical practice guidelines for fever. The risk of adverse outcomes when depending on this strategy is likely to be low, provided infants are carefully selected for outpatient management, the interval to urine culture result is short, follow-up is assured, and other tests, when deemed necessary, are performed.

### SPL drug information for cefuroxime axetil [^11256UxD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefuroxime axetil PO (also known as Ceftin, Zinacef):

- **Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-negative results for blood glucose tests using ferricyanide.

- **Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-positive results for urine glucose tests using copper reduction.

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefuroxime axetil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefuroxime axetil, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Superinfection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens may occur during treatment.

### Epidemiological urinalysis of children from kindergartens of Can Gio, Ho Chi Minh City - Vietnam [^111R2uii]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiological study of bacteriuria in infants of a Swedish cohort reported positivity in 2.5% of boys and 0.9% of girls, and no major malformations were found after urography. Westwood et al. concluded that there was no evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of routine investigation of children with confirmed UTI. In our study concerning asymptomatic children, the five subjects with a positive urine culture for bacteria were investigated with a renal ultrasound; four of them were normal. The urography was therefore arguably not necessary. However, recommendations for the evaluation of UTI include performing an ultrasound and a voiding cystourethrogram after the first UTI. Searching for other modifiable host factors, such as voiding dysfunction or constipation, is crucial following the documentation of a UTI. Hence, the appearance of any symptoms suggestive of a UTI in children should lead to a complete assessment, especially because vesicoureteral reflux is proven to be associated with reinfections. Vesicoureteral reflux is interesting as a cause of UTIs in the youngest children or in those with recurrent pyelonephritis. Otherwise, factors related to bladder function (including constipation) are much more important. This is why information campaigns were conducted in Can Gio for parents and educators on voiding disorders in children, emphasizing the importance of hygiene and hydration.

Hematuria and/or proteinuria are the aim of most urinary screenings among asymptomatic children because the finding of both hematuria and proteinuria may indicate underlying issues.

The limited evidence of moderate quality suggests that an elevated PCT may be helpful for diagnosing bacteraemia, while a positive urine dipstick may be useful in diagnosing UTI. Although an elevated WBC count has limited utility in diagnosing intra-abdominal infections, it may be useful, along with elevated WBC differentials, in differentiating bacterial infections from other acute illnesses. Further studies of high quality are urgently needed in this area.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^112t7zw8]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

This cohort covers the years 1997–2015, and we have shown a progressive increase in the odds of developing hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury following a UTI in more recent years. The increase in hyperkalaemia may be due to an increased rate of blood testing in primary care (particularly among groups at risk of high potassium levels, such as patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) or improved automatic recording of test results in general practice records. The marked increase in acute kidney injury over time, as defined by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding, is well established and likely to be predominantly related to increased clinical focus and the adoption of consensus definitions defined by changes in creatinine levels. By adjusting for calendar period, we aimed to minimise the influence of these secular trends on our results.

In contrast to previous studies, we did not identify an increased risk of death from any cause in users of trimethoprim. The two previous papers that identified an increased risk of sudden death among users of renin-angiotensin system blockade taking co-trimoxazole used a case-control design with cases defined by sudden death, among residents of Ontario over 18 years of follow-up. They were therefore well powered for this outcome. We chose all-cause death as a prespecified analysis owing to lack of power for cause-specific death, since we restricted the cohort to patients with a UTI to address issues of confounding by indication for antibiotic choice that had limited previous research.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation**: Urinalysis should be performed at initial evaluation and when clinically indicated at follow-up visits for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

- **Clinical question 4**: Should urine cultures versus no testing be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms?

	Quantitative urine culture is used to diagnose a UTI by testing for the type of organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. It should be performed only in patients with symptoms such as dysuria, cloudy and/or malodorous urine, lower abdominal pain, and fever.

- **Recommendation**: A urine culture should be performed for individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms only if there is a suspicion of a UTI. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 91%).

- **Clinical question 5**: Should individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms complete a bladder diary versus not complete a bladder diary?

	Recording fluid intake, ideally together with urine output, helps to corroborate the history, recognize beverages and drinking habits detrimental to urinary symptoms, and provide an assessment of the functional bladder capacity. Nocturnal polyuria and polydipsia can be diagnosed only by using a bladder diary.

- **Recommendation**: A three-day bladder diary should be completed by individuals with neurological diseases having urinary problems at initial evaluation and at follow-up visits when clinically indicated to provide an objective assessment of urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^115VUJun]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The following investigations were performed following admission in the well-looking infant who had two separate readings of fever ≥ 38.0 °C (including the temperature from triage) or a single temperature reading of ≥ 38.5 °C, or earlier if there were clinical findings of an unwell infant: full blood count (FBC) looking specifically at the total white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin levels, platelets, and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Bacteremia was defined as bacterial growth in blood cultures (excluding common contaminants such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus). Urine for analysis and culture were routinely performed. Urinary tract infections were defined as a positive urine culture with a growth of a single bacteria of more than 10⁵ colony forming units (CFU)/L from a mid-stream urine sample, or 10⁴ CFU/L from a catheterized specimen. Lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and culture were performed when clinically indicated as decided by the attending physician. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made following a positive CSF culture, or if the CSF fluid was suggestive of bacterial meningitis such as significant pleocytosis (> 1000 cells/mm³), low CSF glucose, or low CSF glucose to serum ratio, in the absence of a positive culture. We included the latter because bacteria growth from CSF culture depends on the amount of bacteria present (which may be transient) and other supportive biochemical features on CSF analysis are vital for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.

### Overdiagnosis of urinary tract infection and underdiagnosis of sexually transmitted infection in adult women presenting to an emergency department [^114xdFbb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are commonly diagnosed in emergency departments (EDs). Distinguishing between these syndromes can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms and because both are associated with abnormalities on urinalysis (UA). We conducted a 2-month observational cohort study to determine the accuracy of clinical diagnoses of UTI and STI in adult women presenting with genitourinary (GU) symptoms or diagnosed with GU infections at an urban academic ED. For all urine specimens, UA, culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Chlamydia trachomatis*, and *Trichomonas vaginalis* were performed.

Of 264 women studied, providers diagnosed 175 (66%) with UTIs, 100 (57%) of whom were treated without performing a urine culture during routine care. Combining routine care and study-performed urine cultures, only 84 (48%) of these women had a positive urine culture. Sixty (23%) of the 264 women studied had one or more positive STI tests, 22 (37%) of whom did not receive treatment for an STI within 7 days of the ED visit. Fourteen (64%) of these 22 women were diagnosed with a UTI instead of an STI.

Ninety-two percent of the women studied had an abnormal UA finding (greater-than-trace leukocyte esterase level, positive nitrite test result, or pyuria). The positive and negative predictive values of an abnormal UA finding were 41% and 76%, respectively. In this population, empirical therapy for UTI without urine culture testing and overdiagnosis of UTI were common and associated with unnecessary treatment.

### Is a lumbar puncture necessary when evaluating febrile infants (30 to 90 days of age) with an abnormal urinalysis [^116nbqbW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of febrile infants aged 30 to 90 days presenting to the emergency department (ED) suggest that a lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed routinely if a positive urinalysis is found during initial investigations. The aim of our study was to assess the necessity of routine LPs in infants aged 30 to 90 days presenting to the ED for a fever without source but are found to have a positive urine analysis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all infants aged 30 to 90 days, presenting to the Montreal Children's Hospital ED from October 2001 to August 2005 who underwent an LP for bacterial culture, in addition to urinalysis and blood and urine cultures. Descriptive statistics and their corresponding confidence intervals were used.

- **Results**: Overall, 392 infants were identified using the microbiology laboratory database. Fifty-seven patients had an abnormal urinalysis. Of these, 1 infant (71 days old) had an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection, bacteremia, and meningitis. This patient, however, was not well on history, and the peripheral white blood cell count was low at 2.9 × 10⁹/L. Thus, the negative predictive value of an abnormal urinalysis for meningitis was 98.2%.

- **Conclusions**: Routine LPs are not required in infants (30–90 days) presenting to the ED with a fever and a positive urinalysis if they are considered at low risk for serious bacterial infection based on clinical and laboratory criteria. However, we recommend that judicious clinical judgment be used; in doubt, an LP should be performed before empirical antibiotic treatment.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to one of two community hospital emergency departments or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients were excluded if they had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within one hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of one or two uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, or "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment based on a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment".

### A cost-minimization analysis of treatment options for postmenopausal women with dysuria [^116xJLDk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy for urinary tract infection is difficult in postmenopausal women because of the higher rates of confounding lower urinary tract symptoms and differential resistance profiles of uropathogens in this population.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to determine the least costly strategy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with the primary complaint of dysuria.

- **Study design**: We performed a cost-minimization analysis modeling the following clinical options: (1) empiric antibiotic therapy followed by urine culture, (2) urinalysis with empiric antibiotic therapy only if positive for nitrites and leukocyte esterase, or (3) waiting for culture prior to initiating antibiotics. For all strategies, we included nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, or cephalexin. Pathogens included Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis. Pathogens, resistance, treatment success, and medication side effects were specific to postmenopausal women.

- **Results**: Cost-minimization modeling with TreeAge Pro assumed 73.4% of urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli with 24.4% resistance to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. With our assumptions, empiric antibiotics with nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was the least costly approach ($89.64/patient), followed by waiting for urine culture ($97.04/patient). Except for empiric antibiotics with fosfomycin, empiric antibiotics was always less costly than using urinalysis to discriminate antibiotic use.

### Early features of Kawasaki disease with pyuria in febrile infants younger than 6 months [^111ooBYC]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Prolonged fever duration, elevated ESR, and a negative urine nitrite test can serve as early clues to suspect Kawasaki disease (KD) in febrile infants with pyuria. Therefore, in patients presenting with these features, as well as persistent fever despite appropriate antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infections (UTI), echocardiography is warranted to identify the possible presence of KD.

### Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies [^111J6J4C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

There is a risk that people who undergo invasive urodynamic studies, such as cystometry, may develop urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine or blood. However, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before or immediately after invasive cystometry or urodynamic studies is not without the risk of adverse effects and the emergence of resistant microbes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. The hypothesis was that administering prophylactic antibiotics reduces urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trial Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1966 to January 2009), PubMed (1 January 1980 to January 2009), LILACS (up to January 2009), TRIP database (up to January 2009), and the UK NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (searched 10 December 2009). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, the primary trials, and the proceedings of the International Urogynaecological Association, International Continence Society, and the American Urological Association for the years 1999 to 2009 to identify articles not captured by electronic searches. There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing urodynamic studies were selected.

The primary aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) during their annual examinations. It also examined the impact of urine testing on subsequent antibiotic use.

- **Design**: The study employed a retrospective cohort design.

- **Setting**: Conducted at a major SCI center.

- **Participants**: The study involved veterans (N = 393) with SCI who attended an outpatient annual evaluation in 2012 or 2013.

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: Focused on antibiotic use for bacteriuria within 7 days following the annual evaluation encounter.

- **Results**:

Out of 327 clinic visits meeting inclusion criteria, 249 had urine cultures performed. Among these, 171 cultures (69%) were positive for bacteria. Of the positive cases, 22 (13%) were urinary tract infections (UTIs), while 149 (87%) were ASB cases. Notably, more than a third of ASB cases (n = 53, 36%) were treated with antibiotics. None of the 78 visits with negative urine cultures resulted in antibiotic treatment for UTI; thus, a positive urine culture alone was linked to antibiotic use (p < 0.01). Factors predicting antibiotic use included higher age, nitrite presence on urinalysis, and urease-producing organisms on culture media. When comparing bladder management strategies, indwelling catheterization was associated with higher levels of pyuria and hematuria compared to spontaneous voiding or intermittent catheterization (p < 0.01).

Conclusions indicate that two-thirds of urine cultures from individuals with SCI during their annual examination tested positive. Most of the positive cultures represented ASB cases.

### Identification of novel factors associated with inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in acute and long-term care [^116NHUvz]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Low credibility.

Chart reviews often fall short of determining what drove antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). To overcome this shortcoming, we searched providers' free-text for documentation of their decision-making and for misleading signs and symptoms that may trigger unnecessary treatment of ASB.

- **Methods**: We reviewed a random sample of 10 positive urine cultures per month, per facility, from patients in acute or long-term care wards at 8 Veterans Affairs facilities. Cultures were classified as urinary tract infection (UTI) or ASB, and as treated or untreated. Charts were searched for 13 potentially misleading symptoms, and free-text documentation of providers' decision-making was classified into 5 categories. We used generalized estimating equations logistic regression to identify factors associated with ASB treatment.

- **Results**: One hundred fifty-eight (27.5%) of 575 ASB cases were inappropriately treated with antibiotics. Significant factors associated with inappropriate treatment included abdominal pain, falls, decreased urine output, urine characteristics, abnormal vital signs, laboratory values, and voiding issues. Providers prescribed an average of 1.4 antimicrobials to patients with ASB, with cephalosporins (41%) and fluoroquinolones (21%) being the most common classes prescribed.

- **Conclusions**: Chart reviews of providers' decision-making highlighted new factors associated with inappropriate ASB treatment. These findings can help design antibiotic stewardship interventions for ASB.

### Urine dipstick for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months [^115WLzwX]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Urine dipsticks can be performed at the point of care, whereas urinalysis requires laboratory analysis. We compared the accuracy of urine dipstick with urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional study of previously healthy infants aged 2 to 6 months who presented to one of 5 emergency departments with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 °C and had a catheterized urine culture obtained. We defined a UTI with a urine culture growing greater than or equal to 50000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of a single bacterial uropathogen. Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to select the optimal urine white blood cell (WBC) cut point, we compared positive urine dipstick (≥ 1+ leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite) to dichotomized urine WBC count for the diagnosis of UTI.

- **Results**: Of 9387 febrile infants who had a urine culture performed, 1044 (11%) had a UTI. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen identified (923; 88.4%). The optimal urine WBC cut point was greater than or equal to 7 cells per high-power field (HPF). When compared with urine WBC count of greater than or equal to 7 cells per HPF, urine dipstick had a higher sensitivity (831/921 [90.2%] dipstick vs 738/880 [83.9%] urine WBC; difference 6.4%, 95% CI 3.8%-8.9%) and specificity (6352/6862 [92.6%] dipstick vs 3679/4231 [87.0%] urine WBC; difference 5.6%, 95% CI 4.7%-6.6%).

- **Conclusion**: Urine dipstick is an accurate diagnostic test for UTI in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months.

### Septic arthritis in an afebrile young infant with a urinary tract infection [^112uqhz8]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Although guidelines exist for the evaluation of serious bacterial infections in febrile young infants, these infections are less likely to be considered in those who are afebrile. We discuss the case of an afebrile, well-appearing, previously healthy 5-week-old girl who presented with left knee swelling and was found to have an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection complicated by E. coli septic arthritis. This case underscores the importance of considering serious bacterial infections in afebrile, well-appearing infants less than 2 months old and maintaining a low threshold for diagnostic testing. Furthermore, this case highlights a unique pathophysiology of septic arthritis from a urinary source, emphasizing the need for providers to consider urine testing in cases of young infants with septic arthritis.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^117VWJoL]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The unplanned cessation of treatment occurred in 221 patients (female = 210; male = 11) of the 1035 active patients at the service, with a mean age of 56 years (range = 19–92; SD = 17.81). Sixty-six percent of the women were post-menopausal. They had experienced treatment-resistant, painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) for a mean of 6 years (SD = 7) prior to presentation at this center. They had attended the center for an average of seven clinic visits (SD = 6) over a mean of 1.7 years (SD = 2), and all 1035 active patients were being treated with antibiotics with regular trials of cessation.

One hundred and ninety-nine patients (90%; female = 188; male = 9) reported deterioration in their symptoms after stopping treatment. Thus, 21 did not report deterioration (10%; female = 19; male = 2). We collected data on 192 (97%) of those who deteriorated. The other seven were unavailable to provide the minimum data set of symptom measures at three assessments. Eight hundred and fourteen patients on our books did not have their treatment interfered with during the 4-week clinic suspension as they were either not due an appointment during this period or some managed to renew their prescription from the GP or private gynecologist.

Patients had been assessed an average of 58 days (SD = 49) before clinic closure. The service was closed for 5 weeks and the patients were first reviewed an average of 68 days (SD = 38) after the closure. Their last review, within a year of the suspension, was a mean of 284 days after clinic closure (SD = 76).

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: Prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^117U1aG1]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

**Frequency of serious bacterial infection**: The combined prevalence of any of the three infections of interest — urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or bacteraemia — was 7.2% (1,140/15,781, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7% to 7.5%). Urinary tract infection occurred in 543 (3.4%) of febrile illness cases (95% CI 3.2% to 3.7%), pneumonia in 533 (3.4%) of cases (95% CI 3.1% to 3.7%), and bacteraemia in 64 (0.4%) instances (95% CI 0.3% to 0.5%). There were 1,066 illnesses caused by a single serious bacterial infection of interest and 37 illnesses caused by two of these infections. Thus, 1,140 serious bacterial infections of interest occurred in 1,103 separate illnesses in 1,054 children. Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and meningitis were rare, responsible for 12, eight, and six illnesses, respectively; 10 of these infections occurred in illnesses involving more than one infection.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: Observational study [^1176DfJL]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice and represent the most common bacterial infection in women. Urine is the most commonly received specimen in microbiological laboratories, and more than 20% of isolates are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins, while 50% are resistant to amoxicillin.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: A recent study in the United Kingdom documented the impact of antibiotic resistance for patients with urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, based on retrospective telephone assessment of symptoms, which limited the ability to accurately assess the pattern and severity of symptoms. A recent prospective study used diaries to document the association of antibiotic resistance with three days' longer duration of milder symptoms and defined symptom resolution as symptoms being labeled a very slight problem or less. Patients and doctors, however, might be reluctant to alter prescribing decisions based on the duration of mild symptoms, so the impact on more meaningful severe symptoms requires clarification. The impact of a resistant infection would be expected to be similar to one in which antibiotics were withheld, assuming microbiological diagnosis is important, which has been questioned recently. Such a natural "experiment" would provide useful and complementary information to the limited data available for antibiotics from placebo-controlled trials. Finally, no observational study at the time of writing has explored whether there are subgroups of symptoms that more clearly respond to antibiotics.

### Use of urine dipstick evaluating young infants with fever without a source and positive urine culture [^114jHKBi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We analyzed 239 febrile infants under 3 months of age with a positive urine culture to examine their characteristics. Patients with an altered urine dipstick more commonly showed alterations in the biological markers for bacterial infection, and Escherichia coli was more frequently isolated. Febrile young infants with a positive urine culture and a negative urine dipstick may not have a urinary tract infection, and less aggressive management can be considered.

### Urine cultures among hospitalized veterans: Casting too broad a net [^1111uDHU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Since the detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria among inpatients often leads to inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, we studied why urine cultures were ordered and the correlates of treatment. Most cultures were obtained from patients without urinary complaints, and a minority from asymptomatic patients. High-count bacteriuria, not clinical manifestations, appeared to trigger most antimicrobial use.

### Response to antibiotics of women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative dipstick urine test results: double blind randomised controlled trial [^116MibYa]. BMJ (2005). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for women showing symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) but with negative urine dipstick testing.

- **Design**: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: The trial was conducted in a primary care setting among a randomly selected group of general practitioners in Christchurch, New Zealand.

- **Participants**: A total of 59 women aged 16–50 years with a history of dysuria and frequency, who tested negative for both nitrites and leucocytes in midstream urine dipstick tests, participated in the study. Participants with complicated UTIs were excluded.

- **Intervention**: The intervention involved administering trimethoprim 300 mg daily for three days or a placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes were documented through a self-reported diary of symptoms over seven days, followed by a structured telephone questionnaire. The main clinical outcome focused on the resolution of dysuria at three and seven days and the median time to resolution. Secondary outcomes involved the resolution of other symptoms.

- **Results**: The median time for dysuria resolution was three days for the trimethoprim group compared to five days for the placebo group (P = 0.002). At day 3, five patients (24%) in the treatment group experienced ongoing dysuria, compared to 20 patients (74%) in the placebo group (P = 0.005). This significant difference persisted until day 7, with two patients (10%) in the treatment group and 11 patients (41%) in the placebo group still experiencing symptoms (P = 0.02). The number needed to treat was four. The duration of constitutional symptoms, such as feverishness and shivers, was reduced by four days.

- **Conclusions**: The study concluded that despite a negative dipstick test for leucocytes and nitrites, antibiotic treatment significantly improved symptom resolution in women with UTI symptoms.
