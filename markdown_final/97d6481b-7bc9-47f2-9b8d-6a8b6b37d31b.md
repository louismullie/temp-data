## Question

Tubular adenoma colonoscopy follow up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate colonoscopy surveillance interval after removal of tubular adenomas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core risk features that drive interval length. Then, I should verify that the baseline colonoscopy was high quality and that polypectomy was complete. Next, I will apply the 2020 US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) risk-stratified intervals, followed by a quick double-check against the AGA update. After that, I should consider special scenarios that modify the interval, including piecemeal resections, serrated lesions, and poor prep. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling points and ensure the documentation meets quality standards.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification elements I must capture: number of adenomas, largest size, histology (purely tubular versus tubulovillous/villous), dysplasia grade, and any high-risk features such as proximal location or suboptimal preparation, because these features directly map to surveillance intervals in USMSTF 2020 [^116m1nai] [^116XvCiY].

> I need to ensure the baseline examination quality assumptions are met before I apply any interval: the colonoscopy should be complete to the cecum with adequate bowel preparation to visualize lesions greater than 5 mm, the endoscopist should have an adequate adenoma detection rate, and there should be high confidence of complete polypectomy. Otherwise, I should shorten the interval or repeat the exam sooner to mitigate missed or incompletely removed lesions [^116XvCiY] [^113vgUak] [^114P53v2].

> Now, applying the 2020 USMSTF intervals for low-risk tubular adenomas: for 1–2 tubular adenomas, each less than 10 mm and completely removed, the recommended interval is 7–10 years. Hold on, let me verify that I'm not defaulting to 5 years — older guidance sometimes used 5–10 years, but the 2020 update extended the interval to 7–10 years for this exact scenario, reflecting very low absolute risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia in this group [^1149dRXz] [^116m1nai] [^112WC88M].

> For intermediate-risk findings, I should confirm that 3–4 tubular adenomas, all less than 10 mm, warrant a 3–5 year interval. Wait, I almost said 3 years by default, but the 2020 update labels this a weak recommendation and favors the longer end of the range, i.e., 5 years, given the very low quality of evidence and emerging data suggesting low metachronous risk in this subgroup, so 5 years is reasonable unless there are additional risk modifiers [^113yM59u] [^111fPhzV].

> For high-risk features, I need to ensure a 3-year interval when any of the following are present: 5–10 adenomas (all < 10 mm), at least one adenoma ≥ 10 mm, villous or tubulovillous histology, or high-grade dysplasia. I should double-check that these remain strong recommendations and that they assume complete resection — if completeness is uncertain, earlier follow-up is warranted [^116XbCTw] [^116m1nai] [^115s5yZj].

> Special situations require even shorter intervals: if there are more than 10 adenomas at a single examination, I should recommend repeat colonoscopy in 1 year and consider genetic counseling for polyposis syndromes. And for piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection of lesions ≥ 20 mm, the first surveillance should be at about 6 months due to high recurrence risk, with additional follow-up at 1 year and 3 years after that first check, given recurrence rates around 20% with piecemeal techniques [^111qBB44] [^115UaLY1] [^1117S7NV].

> Next, I should review how serrated lesions fit into this schema, because I need to avoid mixing serrated and conventional adenoma risks: 1–2 sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) less than 10 mm generally follow a 5–10 year interval, whereas SSPs ≥ 10 mm or with dysplasia, and traditional serrated adenomas, fall into a 3-year category. If conventional adenomas coexist, I should apply the adenoma-based interval rather than the serrated-only interval to avoid undertreatment [^115zYpag] [^117DLjeU].

> But wait, what if the baseline prep was fair or poor? I should confirm that suboptimal preparation lowers confidence and can justify shortening the interval. If the prep was poor, repeating colonoscopy within 1 year is reasonable, and if fair but adequate to detect lesions > 5 mm with only small tubular adenomas found, some guidance allows consideration of a 5-year interval, though I should individualize based on overall risk and endoscopist judgment [^111GeJSD] [^114P53v2].

> I will now examine the evidence supporting the 7–10 year interval for 1–2 small tubular adenomas to ensure I'm not overextending surveillance: meta-analyses show a 5-year cumulative metachronous advanced neoplasia risk around 4.9% for low-risk adenoma versus 3.3% for normal colonoscopy, with no excess CRC mortality, and the AGA 2021 update notes increasing evidence that 1–2 diminutive adenomas are not at significantly elevated CRC risk, supporting a 10-year interval for many in this group [^112Ha4Un] [^112v4v1d] [^116i4a5A].

> Hold on, I should verify that my counseling aligns with shared decision-making: for patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, I should explain that 7–10 years is acceptable and that extending toward 10 years is reasonable given their near-average risk, while emphasizing that the interval assumes a high-quality baseline exam and complete polypectomy. If they prefer a shorter interval for reassurance, I can individualize within the 7–10 year window, documenting the rationale [^114k8C4D] [^1149dRXz].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation quality: I should record exact counts, sizes, histology, dysplasia grade, and polyp location, and for polyps ≥ 10 mm I should include endoscopic photos with size reference. I should also explicitly state the surveillance interval and the quality assumptions that underpin it, because this both supports appropriate follow-up and facilitates adherence to guidelines [^113vgUak] [^114MJnoA].

For patients with 1–2 small (< 10 mm) tubular adenomas removed at a high-quality colonoscopy, the recommended surveillance interval is **7–10 years** [^1149dRXz] [^112y8ufV]. This interval reflects their low risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia and is supported by moderate-quality evidence [^112v4v1d]. If the baseline colonoscopy was suboptimal or polypectomy was incomplete, consider a shorter interval or earlier repeat colonoscopy [^111GeJSD] [^113iLfBg]. For 3–4 small adenomas, the interval is **3–5 years** [^113yM59u]; for 5–10 adenomas or any advanced features (≥ 10 mm, villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia), it is **3 years** [^116XbCTw] [^115s5yZj]. These intervals assume complete polyp removal, adequate bowel preparation, and a high-quality examination [^116MoFGr] [^113vgUak].

## Risk stratification and surveillance intervals

The US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) provides **clear risk-based surveillance intervals** based on the number, size, and histology of adenomas:

| **Risk category** | **Findings** | **Recommended surveillance interval** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm | 7–10 years [^1149dRXz] [^112y8ufV] |
| Intermediate-risk | 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm | 3–5 years [^113yM59u] [^111fPhzV] |
| High-risk | - ≥ 5 adenomas < 10 mm <br/> - Any adenoma ≥ 10 mm <br/> - Villous or tubulovillous histology <br/> - High-grade dysplasia | 3 years [^116XbCTw] [^115s5yZj] |
| Very high-risk | > 10 adenomas | 1 year [^111qBB44] [^1118k5Eq] |

---

These intervals assume **complete polyp removal**, **adequate bowel preparation**, and a **high-quality colonoscopy** [^116MoFGr] [^113vgUak].

---

## Evidence supporting the 7–10 year interval

The 7–10 year interval for 1–2 small tubular adenomas is supported by **moderate-quality evidence** showing a low risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia. Meta-analyses report a 5-year cumulative incidence of advanced neoplasia of 4.9% in this group versus 3.3% in those with a normal colonoscopy, with no significant difference in colorectal cancer incidence or mortality [^112v4v1d] [^112Ha4Un]. Accordingly, the USMSTF recommends the 7–10 year interval to balance cancer prevention with the risks and costs of unnecessary colonoscopies [^114k8C4D].

---

## Factors influencing surveillance intervals

Several factors may **shorten or extend the recommended interval**:

- **Quality of baseline colonoscopy**: Suboptimal preparation or incomplete polypectomy may warrant earlier follow-up [^111GeJSD] [^115UaLY1].
- **Patient preferences and comorbidities**: Shared decision-making may adjust intervals based on patient values and health status [^114k8C4D].
- **Family history**: A strong family history of colorectal cancer may prompt earlier surveillance [^1147g7Ng].

---

## Consequences of non-adherence to guidelines

Non-adherence to recommended intervals is common and leads to **overuse or underuse of colonoscopy**. Overuse increases healthcare costs and procedural risks, while underuse delays detection of advanced neoplasia. A large community-based study found that 76% of patients received surveillance earlier than recommended, often due to clinician preference or patient anxiety [^113fTUYw]. Conversely, delayed surveillance is associated with higher rates of advanced neoplasia at follow-up [^111istkF].

---

## Patient adherence and barriers

Patient adherence to surveillance intervals is influenced by several factors:

- **Lack of awareness**: Many patients are unaware of recommended intervals [^notfound].
- **Financial constraints**: Insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs affect adherence [^111istkF].
- **System-level factors**: Inefficient tracking and reminder systems contribute to missed intervals [^111istkF].

---

## Comparison with other guidelines

The USMSTF guidelines align with those of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), which also recommend **longer intervals for low-risk adenomas** and shorter intervals for high-risk lesions [^116i4a5A] [^114mFkRd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **1–2 small tubular adenomas (< 10 mm)**: 7–10 years [^1149dRXz] [^112y8ufV].
- **3–4 small tubular adenomas (< 10 mm)**: 3–5 years [^113yM59u] [^111fPhzV].
- **≥ 5 adenomas or advanced features**: 3 years [^116XbCTw] [^115s5yZj].
- **> 10 adenomas**: 1 year [^111qBB44] [^1118k5Eq].

---

The recommended surveillance interval after removal of 1–2 small tubular adenomas is **7–10 years**, reflecting their low risk of advanced neoplasia. Adherence to this interval balances cancer prevention with minimizing unnecessary procedures.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113iLfBg]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — baseline finding of one or more tubular adenomas ≥ 10 mm retains the "3-year interval" from the 2006 recommendation with "No change" in 2012 and "High – evidence stronger than 2006". New evidence shows higher risk with larger polyps, including 10–19 mm (15.9% vs 7.7%; OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.84–2.78) and ≥ 20 mm (19.3%; OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.24–4.00), and in the VA Cooperative Study 380 baseline adenomas > 10 mm had 15.5% advanced neoplasia vs 2.4% with no neoplasia within 3.5 years (RR, 5.01; 95% CI, 2.10–11.96). The recommendation states that patients with one or more adenomas ≥ 10 mm have increased risk and "There is no basis for changing the recommended 3-year surveillance interval", assuming a high-quality examination with complete removal; if there is question about completeness (ie, piecemeal resection), "early follow-up colonoscopy is warranted".

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111YS8Qm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer surveillance after colonoscopy — Section 1 PICO questions specify comparisons and outcomes related to follow-up intervals. In patients with normal colonoscopy, repeat colonoscopy at 10 y versus earlier surveillance and no repeat colonoscopy versus colonoscopy at 10 y or earlier are evaluated with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. For patients with 1–2 small (< 10 mm) nonadvanced adenomas, the questions ask whether surveillance is preferred to no surveillance and whether surveillance at 5 y is preferred to surveillance at 10 y. For sessile serrated adenoma/polyp, comparisons evaluate surveillance at 3 y versus surveillance at 5 or 10 y when size ≥ 10 mm and/or with dysplasia and when size < 10 mm with no dysplasia. For advanced adenoma and for patients with any advanced neoplasia defined as adenoma with ≥ 10 mm, villous histology, and/or high-grade dysplasia, the questions compare surveillance at 3 y versus at 5 or 10 y. Additional comparisons ask whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to 5 or 10 y in patients with adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size and in those with adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia.

Post-polypectomy surveillance research reporting — best practices: The authors state they have several suggestions for best practices and "we suggest as a best practice" reporting presence of individual findings (eg, villous adenoma, SSP, and HP ≥ 10 mm) alongside summary categories (advanced neoplasia, advanced adenoma, and large serrated polyp [HP or SSP ≥ 10 mm]); "we suggest it is particularly important to separate SSPs" from aggregate categories; "we suggest specifically reporting SSP, HPs, and TSAs separately" and clearly defining any aggregate categories (such as serrated polyps ≥ 10 mm); providing histology-specific data to compare outcomes (including whether HP ≥ 10 mm resembles SSP ≥ 10 mm); noting that most surveillance studies provide limited baseline colonoscopy quality data; and "we recommend that both relative and absolute risks" (e.g., metachronous advanced neoplasia) be provided, as absolute risks are key for patient and physician perspective.

Table 3 — terms and definitions for colonoscopy quality and polyp risk categories define key thresholds and criteria. Average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is the absence of inflammatory bowel disease, family history of CRC, hereditary syndrome associated with increased risk, serrated polyposis syndrome, or personal history of CRC. Normal colonoscopy is a colonoscopy where no adenoma, SSP, TSA, HP ≥ 10 mm, or CRC is found. Low-risk adenoma is 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm in size. Advanced adenoma is 1 or more of the following findings: adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Advanced neoplasia is 1 or more of the following findings: adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or CRC. High-risk adenoma is 1 or more of the following findings: advanced neoplasia or 3 or more adenomas. Adequate adenoma detection rate (ADR) is ADR ≥ 30% in men and ≥ 20% in women. Adequate bowel preparation is bowel preparation adequate for visualization of polyps > 5 mm in size. Complete examination is complete colonoscopy to cecum with photo documentation of cecal landmarks (appendiceal orifice, terminal ileum, or ileocecal valve). High-quality examination is examination complete to cecum with adequate bowel preparation performed by a colonoscopist with adequate adenoma detection rate and attention to complete polyp excision. The authors state, "We propose moving forward that rather than using categories such as 'high-risk adenoma' or 'low-risk adenoma', that research articles specify the individual criteria being captured by the category (eg, use 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm instead of the term low-risk adenoma) because evidence supporting level of risk for various criteria are constantly evolving".

### Adenoma surveillance and colorectal cancer incidence: a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study [^114akYDf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer morbidity and death in developed countries. Endoscopic removal of adenomas, precursors of most colorectal cancers, reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Patients perceived to be at increased risk after adenoma removal are recommended surveillance colonoscopy.,

National guidelines for adenoma surveillance stratify patients into risk groups based mainly on the detection of advanced neoplasia (adenomas ≥ 10 mm or with advanced pathology, or cancer) in those attending follow-up colonoscopy as a surrogate for long-term colorectal cancer incidence. The risk of advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy depends on the number, size, and histology of baseline adenomas, as well as the quality of the baseline examination.UK, European Union (EU), and US guidelines define a low-risk group for which no surveillance, or surveillance at intervals of 5–10 years, is recommended, an intermediate-risk or higher-risk group for which surveillance every 3 years is recommended, and a high-risk group for which an additional clearing colonoscopy within either 12 months (UK and EU) or within 3 years (USA) is recommended before continuation with surveillance every 3 years. The recommendation for 3-yearly surveillance is based on the results of a randomised trial that showed that the cumulative advanced neoplasia detection rate was similar between patients who had one or two surveillance colonoscopies within 3 years. Although UK and US criteria for 3-yearly surveillance differ slightly (UK criteria are one-to-two adenomas ≥ 10 mm or three-to-four adenomas < 10 mm, whereas US criteria are 3–10 adenomas or any adenomas ≥ 10 mm, with villous architecture or high-grade dysplasia), advanced neoplasia detection rates at follow-up colonoscopy are similar, at 10% in the UK versus 11% in the USA. The UK guideline recommends stopping 3-yearly surveillance after two consecutive negative colonoscopies (appendix p 1), whereas in the USA, there are no recommended criteria for stopping other than older age.

Small adenomas (1–2, < 10 mm) — in 7 prospective polyp surveillance studies, individuals with a history of polyps had metachronous advanced neoplasia risk of 11.5% and those with concurrent distal and proximal small adenomas had 11.0% absolute risk; in a separate study of 4496 patients with 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas, incident CRC risk was similar for proximal only vs distal only adenomas (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–2.8). The authors considered 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, but state that the 7- to 10-year range was chosen because of uncertainty about benefit of surveillance and possible contribution of surveillance to observed low risk; they anticipate ongoing work may clarify benefits and whether characteristics such as size < 6 mm can guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs a longer 10-year interval.

Recommendations after colonoscopy and polypectomy→10 adenomas: For patients with > 10 adenomas completely removed at high-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 1 year (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Patients with > 10 adenomas may be at increased risk for having a hereditary polyposis syndrome, such as familial adenomatous polyposis or MYH-associated polyposis, and multiple groups have recommended patients with > 10 cumulative lifetime adenomas be considered for genetic testing.

### Rationale and design of the European polyp surveillance (EPoS) trials [^111scnZX]. Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopies after polyp removal depending on the number and characteristics of polyps, but there is a lack of evidence supporting the recommendations. This report outlines the rationale and design of two randomized trials and one observational study investigating evidence-based surveillance strategies following polyp removal. Study design and endpoints: The EPoS studies started to recruit patients in April 2015.EPoS study I randomizes 13746 patients with low-risk adenomas (1–2 tubular adenomas size < 10mm, low-grade dysplasia) to surveillance after 5 and 10 years, or 10 years only. EPoS study II randomizes 13704 patients with high-risk adenomas (3–10 adenomas or adenoma ≥ 10mm in diameter, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or > 25% villous features) to surveillance after 3, 5, and 10 years, or 5 and 10 years only. EPoS study III offers surveillance after 5 and 10 years to patients with serrated polyps ≥ 10mm in diameter at any location, or serrated polyps ≥ 5mm in diameter proximal to the splenic flexure. All polyps are removed before patients enter the trials. The primary end point is colorectal cancer incidence after 10 years. We assume a colorectal cancer risk of 1% for patients in EPoS I, and 2% for patients in EPoS II. Using a noninferiority hypothesis with an equivalence interval of 0.5% for EPoS I and 0.7% for EPoS II, the trials are 90% powered to uncover differences larger than the equivalence intervals. For EPoS III, no power analyses have been performed.

Conclusions

The present trials aim to develop evidence-based strategies for polyp surveillance, thereby maximizing effectiveness and minimizing resources.

### Colonoscopy quality measures and adherence to follow-up guidelines among endoscopists participating in a U.S. endoscopy registry [^113Cj2qB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Colonoscopy screening can substantially reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Colonoscopies may achieve maximum benefit when they are performed with high quality and accompanied by follow-up recommendations that adhere to clinical guidelines. This study aimed to determine to what extent endoscopists met targets for colonoscopy quality from 2016 through 2019 (the most recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic).

Methods

We examined measures of colonoscopy quality and recommended follow-up intervals in the GI Quality Improvement Consortium, a large nationwide endoscopy registry. The analysis included > 2.5 million outpatient screening colonoscopies in average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years.

Results

At least 90% of endoscopists met performance targets for adequate bowel preparation, cecal intubation rate, and adenoma detection rate. However, nonadherence to guidelines for follow-up intervals was common. For patients with no colonoscopy findings, 12.0% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 5 years instead of the guideline-recommended 10 years. For patients with 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas, 13.5% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 3 years instead of the guideline-recommended 5 to 10 years. For patients with small sessile serrated polyps, 30.7% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 3 years instead of the guideline-recommended 5 years. Some patients with higher risk findings received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≥ 5 years instead of the guideline-recommended 3 years, including 18.2% of patients with advanced serrated lesions.

Conclusions

Additional attention may be needed to achieve more consistent adherence to guidelines for colonoscopy follow-up recommendations.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116XvCiY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Colonoscopy terms and quality definitions — Table 3 defines key categories and metrics. Normal colonoscopy is a colonoscopy where no adenoma, SSP, TSA, HP ≥ 10 mm, or CRC is found, and individuals with only HPs < 10 mm are considered to have a normal colonoscopy. Low-risk adenoma is 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm in size. Advanced adenoma is defined by 1 or more of the following: adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, while advanced neoplasia includes the same adenoma criteria plus CRC. High-risk adenoma is 1 or more of the following: advanced neoplasia or 3 or more adenomas. Quality benchmarks include adenoma detection rate (ADR) thresholds of ADR ≥ 30% in men and ≥ 20% in women, bowel preparation adequate for visualization of polyps > 5 mm in size, and examination standards of complete colonoscopy to cecum with photo documentation of cecal landmarks and a high-quality examination complete to cecum with adequate bowel preparation, adequate adenoma detection rate, and attention to complete polyp excision. The report also proposes specifying individual criteria rather than broad categories such as "high-risk adenoma" or "low-risk adenoma" (e.g., use 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm).

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116NUoC2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force — risk stratification and surveillance intervals after polypectomy note that patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower than average risk for incident and fatal colorectal cancer (CRC) and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, while individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population risk. Data are emerging to support less frequent surveillance among individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, and 2 studies suggest that exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce risk for incident CRC among high-risk patients. Recommendations are unchanged for advanced adenoma, including those with adenoma ≥ 10 mm, with evidence to support close surveillance in 3 years strengthened. One year, rather than a more general recommendation for < 3-year follow-up colonoscopy for individuals with > 10 adenomas at a single examination, has been recommended to simplify follow-up, although the evidence base has not been markedly strengthened; emerging evidence suggests that individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm are at low risk for metachronous neoplasia.

Surveillance colonoscopy after removal of adenoma — impact varies by risk features. Surveillance after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce incident colorectal cancer (CRC), but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). After removal of adenoma with low-risk features (such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm), the incremental impact on incident and fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). In a UK cohort of 11,944 patients with intermediate-risk adenoma, defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years follow-up 42% did not receive surveillance, and exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with a 43%–48% relative reduction in incident CRC risk (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40–0.80; and HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.84).

Baseline examination — no adenomas; distal small (< 10 mm) hyperplastic polyps: Prior and current evidence suggests that distal hyperplastic polyps (HPs) < 10 mm are benign and nonneoplastic, and if the most advanced lesions at baseline colonoscopy are distal HPs < 10 mm, the interval for colonoscopic follow-up should be 10 years. The 2012 recommendation for next examination indicates No change with Quality of evidence Moderate, and new information notes HPs accounted for 50% of polyps 1–5 mm, 27.9% of polyps 6–9 mm, and 13.7% of polyps > 10 mm.

### Further defining the 2012 multi-society task force guidelines for surveillance of high-risk adenomas: is a 3-year interval needed for all patients? [^112QAnZo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Goals

We set out to determine whether variation from this 3-year follow-up interval was associated with the finding of subsequent high-risk adenoma (HRA).

Background

HRAs include the following: (1) an adenoma measuring ≥ 10mm, (2) ≥ 3 adenomas found during a single procedure, and (3) an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous architecture. The current Multi-Society Task Force guideline for timing of surveillance colonoscopy after removal of a HRA is 3 years.

Study

In 2016, we analyzed 495 patients who had a HRA removed during a 2008 colonoscopy. We compared the frequency of finding another HRA at follow-up intervals. We used the current guidelines as our referent group and performed logistical regression to identify whether any patient characteristics, procedural factors, or type of HRA predicted the development of HRAs on follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

Individuals who followed-up at a median of 4.5 years did not have more HRA on follow-up compared with those who followed-up at 3 years (25.2% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.062). These groups had similar baseline characteristics. Older individuals, male gender, having a history of polyps, and piecemeal resection of an HRA predicted future HRAs. The removal of ≥ 3 adenomas in 2008 as well as a combination of multiple, large, and advanced polyps showed a higher risk of future HRAs.

Conclusions

The 2012 Multi-Society Task Force recommendation of 3-year follow-up after removal of HRAs may not apply to all patients. We showed that a combination of patient demographics, procedural factors, and pathology best determines the surveillance colonoscopy interval.

### Findings on serial surveillance colonoscopy in patients with low-risk polyps on initial colonoscopy [^113j6aMS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals

This study describes the prevalence of adenomatous polyps at serial follow-up exams after a colonoscopy finding 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas.

Study

We conducted a retrospective cohort of patients with 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas on an initial colonoscopy who underwent at least 2 additional surveillance examinations. Our primary outcome was any or advanced adenomas on the third colonoscopy.

Results

Eighty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. At the second and third colonoscopy, 31/88 (35.2%) patients and 26/88 (29.6%) patients had at least 1 adenoma, respectively. Among the 28 patients with 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas on colonoscopy no. 2, the prevalence of any adenomas on colonoscopy no. 3 was 39.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21.5%-59.4%]. Among the 56 patients without adenomas at colonoscopy no. 2, the prevalence of any and advanced adenomas on colonoscopy no. 3 was 25% (95% CI: 14.4%-38.4%), and 3.6% (95% CI: 0.4%-12.3%), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with 1–2 small tubular adenomas on initial colonoscopy the prevalence of adenomas and advanced lesions on the third colonoscopy remains high even if no adenomas are found on the second colonoscopy.

Adenoma surveillance colonoscopy — incident colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and high-risk subgroups: In intermediate-risk adenoma patients, the absolute risk for incident CRC was 2.3% with vs 2.7% without 1 surveillance examination, and in a higher-risk group defined by incomplete colonoscopy, poor preparation, high-grade dysplasia, proximal adenoma, or adenoma ≥ 20 mm, rates were 2.8% with vs 3.3% without, corresponding to HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.75. Among those not meeting higher-risk criteria, the absolute rate was 0.7% vs 1.1% with a nonstatistically significant reduction (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20–1.43). In a French cohort of patients with advanced adenoma, at least 1 follow-up colonoscopy yielded SIR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.62–1.82 versus no follow-up SIR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.89–6.04. Overall, the study states that surveillance colonoscopy in patients with 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm may reduce risk for incident CRC, particularly with baseline incomplete colonoscopy, poor preparation, high-grade dysplasia, adenoma ≥ 20 mm, and/or proximal adenoma.

US Multi‑Society Task Force — sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) surveillance: For patients with 1–2 SSPs < 10 mm in size completely removed at high‑quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 5–10 years (Weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). Reported cohorts show the rate of metachronous advanced neoplasia was 20.7% (6 of 29) in patients with baseline conventional advanced neoplasia and 6.3% (7 of 111) in an isolated serrated polyp group; metachronous advanced serrated polyps were noted in 10% (3 of 30) and 12.5% (2 of 16) for certain baseline categories, and 5.4% (6 of 111) with isolated serrated polyps. In another cohort stratified by baseline group, the rate of advanced neoplasia (including large serrated polyp) was 18.2% with low‑risk adenoma plus any SSP, 7.8% for low‑risk adenoma without SSP, 17.9% for 1–2 SSP < 10 mm, and 15.9% for high‑risk adenoma and/or ≥ 3 conventional adenomas without SSP; the largest study followed 5433 individuals with at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy ≥ 1 years after the initial examination.

Piecemeal resection of adenoma or sessile serrated polyp (SSP) — For patients with piecemeal resection of adenoma or SSP > 20 mm, repeat colonoscopy in 6 months. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Based on the evidence reviewed, the Task Force recommended patients with polyps ≥ 20 mm in size resected piecemeal have first surveillance colonoscopy at approximately 6 months, second surveillance 1 year from first surveillance, and third surveillance 3 years from the second surveillance. Supporting data note higher recurrence after piecemeal EMR: a meta-analysis of 33 studies found risk for recurrent neoplasia was 20% for piecemeal vs just 3% for en bloc; in EMR of polyps 10–20 mm, risk was 18%, similar to 19% for polyps 20–30 mm and > 30 mm; incomplete resection was more common with piecemeal (20%) vs en bloc (8.4%).

### Adherence to surveillance guidelines after removal of colorectal adenomas: a large, community-based study [^113fTUYw]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings that surveillance was too frequent in patients whose recommended surveillance intervals were longer (ie, 3 and 6 years) are in line with self-reported surveillance intervals in US and European surveys among gastroenterologists and/or surgeons, and also with the few smaller studies that assessed the appropriate timing of postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy in clinical practice. In the latter, 46–54% of the patients with surveillance received it too early. In our study, the corresponding percentage was even higher: 76% (ie, 48% of 63% of the patients with surveillance).

Schoen et al reported that surveillance colonoscopy was too early in 34% of patients with a low-risk adenoma profile (patients with one or two non-AAs). The larger proportion of overuse among the low-risk group in our study (48%) may be explained by the discrepancy in risk stratification between the guidelines in effect: whereas patients with one or two adenomas and high-grade dysplasia, a (tubulo) villous aspect, or a size ≥ 10 mm are classified as high-risk patients according to the US guideline and advised a 3-year surveillance interval, the Dutch 2002 guidelines classified these patients as 'low-risk' and recommended a 6-year interval. Physicians in the Netherlands may have shortened the intervals for these patients, considering them to be at higher risk. On the other hand, we also found a considerably greater overuse of surveillance among patients with a high-risk adenoma profile (39% in patients with ≥ three adenomas) than Schoen et al did (14–20% patients with ≥ three non-AAs or ≥ one AA). In the USA, high-risk patients have been recommended a 3-year interval since 1993. As a consequence, US physicians may be more familiar with the 3-year recommendation than the Dutch physicians were in 2002. Generally, the proportion of patients with too early surveillance tends to be higher among low-risk patients than among higher-risk patients, which may again be inherent to the relatively longer recommended surveillance interval itself or be related to a perceived need for shorter surveillance by patients or their physicians.

Low-risk adenomas — metachronous advanced neoplasia risk: The first pooled data from 11,387 individuals across 7 studies with 2–5 years follow-up found the pooled rate of metachronous advanced neoplasia was 3.6% for baseline low-risk adenoma versus 1.6% for normal colonoscopy (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.6). The most recent meta-analysis pooled 10,139 individuals across 8 studies with 3–10 years of follow-up, reporting 5-year cumulative incidence 4.9% for the low-risk adenoma group (95% CI, 3.18%–6.97%) and 3.3% for the no adenoma group (95% CI, 1.85%–5.60%; RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.24–1.94), while advanced adenoma cases had 17.1% (95% CI, 11.97%–23.0%).

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116Pre9d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Large cohort of serrated polyps and adenomas — The largest study to date was a cohort of 5433 individuals with baseline colonoscopy and at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy ≥ 1 years after initial examination; among patients with SSP but no synchronous high-risk adenoma the rate of high-risk adenoma was 2.9%, compared with 18.2% in individuals with isolated high-risk adenoma at baseline, and it was markedly higher in patients with SSP plus synchronous high-risk adenoma (46.4% vs 2.9%). These findings suggest that patients with isolated SSP have low rates of metachronous conventional high-risk adenoma unless they have synchronous conventional adenomas at baseline, and patients with SSP at baseline appear to be at increased risk for metachronous large serrated polyps ≥ 10 mm (HP, SSP, or TSA); taken together, very low quality of evidence exists to support recommendations for surveillance after removal of 1–2 SSPs < 10 mm.

Terms, definitions, and colonoscopy quality assumptions — normal colonoscopy refers to a colonoscopy where no adenoma, sessile serrated adenoma/polyp or sessile serrated polyp (SSP), hyperplastic polyp (HP) ≥ 10 mm, traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), or CRC was found, and individuals with only HP < 10 mm are considered to have had a normal colonoscopy; low-risk adenoma refers to having 1–2 tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, each < 10 mm in size; advanced neoplasia is defined as an adenoma ≥ 10 mm, adenoma with tubulovillous or villous histology, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or presence of invasive cancer; in this report, "high-risk adenoma" refers to patients with advanced neoplasia or ≥ 3 adenomas, and because of evolving evidence about serrated lesions, SSPs and HPs are not included in definitions of low-risk adenoma, high-risk adenoma, and advanced neoplasia; uncertainty exists as to whether HPs ≥ 10 mm are associated with increased risk, and recommendations utilize specific findings such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm rather than summary categories.

### Outcomes at follow-up of negative colonoscopy in average risk population: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XzNNf]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two reviewers (TH and LP) independently used a standardised form to extract the following data: first author, year of publication, country/region, study type and setting, number and age of participants, interval between index and follow-up colonoscopies, and the proportion of participants with a family history, white ethnicity, and male sex. In addition, we extracted statements on the indication for colonoscopy to qualitatively assess the proportion of participants at average risk with screening as the indication for colonoscopy.

We extracted the prevalences of the most advanced findings at follow-up colonoscopy as far as reported. The main outcome parameters were the prevalence of any neoplasm and the prevalence of any advanced neoplasm. The former included any neoplasms (adenomas and cancers), and the latter included advanced adenomas and carcinomas. We defined an advanced adenoma as at least one polyp with any of the following characteristics: greater than 9 mm in size, villous or tubulovillous histology, or high grade dysplasia. If studies differed from these definitions in their classification, we used appropriate surrogates to ensure comparability (supplementary table A).

We did a quality assessment of included studies for descriptive purposes. We used a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. We modified the scale in a way that allowed us to evaluate a comprehensive set of qualitative aspects relevant to answering the research question. For instance, we dropped the pre-specified question on the selection of non-exposed individuals (not applicable for our study) and instead included a question assessing the representativeness of the study population regarding the proportion of participants with screening as the single indication for follow-up colonoscopy. Two reviewers (TH, LP) independently assessed study quality and resolved disagreements by further review and discussion.

### Interval colon cancer in a Lynch syndrome patient under annual colonoscopic surveillance: a case for advanced imaging techniques? [^11168hpG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lynch syndrome is defined as the presence of a germline mutation in a DNA mismatch repair gene. Mutation carriers have increased risk for various malignancies, including carcinomas of the colorectum (CRC), endometrium, ovary, small bowel, stomach, biliary tract, bladder, ureter and renal pelvis. When a mutation is documented in an affected individual, genetic counseling and mutation analysis should be offered to related family members. Mutation carriers face a range of difficult decisions regarding prophylaxis and surveillance. Prophylactic hysterectomy, for example, offers low morbidity and guaranteed protection against endometrial cancer, but may conflict with the desire to bear children. Prophylactic colectomy is also an option, but regular colonoscopic examination is safe and effective and is the favored approach for most patients.

Colonoscopic surveillance should begin at age 20–25. There has been debate about the optimal timing for examinations, with the recommended interval narrowing recently from three years to two years and finally to the current preference for colonoscopy every one to two years until age 40, with yearly colonoscopy thereafter. The rationale for the one-year timeframe is that interval cancers have been described in patients being examined every two or three years, probably in part because the precursor lesion for CRC in Lynch syndrome – the adenoma – progresses through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence more rapidly than a sporadic adenoma.

We describe a young woman with known Lynch syndrome who presented for her surveillance colonoscopic examination and was discovered to have a right-sided CRC arising in a tubular adenoma, one year after a normal examination.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^114k8C4D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy — conclusions and interval guidance note that for patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, a 7- to 10-year, rather than a 5- to 10-year follow-up recommendation is described, and patients, primary care physicians, and colonoscopists will need to engage in shared decision making regarding whether to lengthen the follow-up interval. The conclusions state that CRC incidence and mortality are decreasing secondary to improvements in risk factor exposure, screening, treatment, and perhaps exposure to surveillance among patients with polyps, and that some patients with polyps appear to have persistently increased risk for CRC and may have increased risk for advanced neoplasia on follow-up. Evidence to support best practices for surveillance colonoscopy has strengthened and has helped to support close follow-up for some groups, as well as less intensive follow-up for others, and surveillance colonoscopy to attempt to reduce CRC risk is clinically rational and recommended.

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in Europe (EPAGE II). Surveillance after polypectomy and after resection of colorectal cancer [^1169GALX]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

To summarize the published literature on assessment of appropriateness of colonoscopy for surveillance after polypectomy and after curative-intent resection of colorectal cancer (CRC), and report appropriateness criteria developed by an expert panel, the 2008 European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, EPAGE II.

Methods

A systematic search of guidelines, systematic reviews and primary studies regarding the evaluation and management of surveillance colonoscopy after polypectomy and after resection of CRC was performed. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied to develop appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy for these conditions.

Results

Most CRCs arise from adenomatous polyps. The characteristics of removed polyps, especially the distinction between low-risk adenomas (1 or 2, small [< 1 cm], tubular, no high-grade dysplasia) vs. high-risk adenomas (large [≥ 1 cm], multiple [> 3], high-grade dysplasia or villous features), have an impact on advanced adenoma recurrence. Most guidelines recommend a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy for high-risk adenomas and a 5-year colonoscopy for low-risk adenomas. Despite the lack of evidence to support or refute any survival benefit for follow-up colonoscopy after curative-intent CRC resection, surveillance colonoscopy is recommended by most guidelines. The timing of the first surveillance colonoscopy differs. The expert panel considered that 56% of the clinical indications for colonoscopy for surveillance after polypectomy were appropriate. For surveillance after CRC resection, it considered colonoscopy appropriate 1 year after resection.

Conclusions

Colonoscopy is recommended as a first-choice procedure for surveillance after polypectomy by all published guidelines and by the EPAGE II criteria. Despite the limitations of the published studies, colonoscopy is also recommended by most of the guidelines and by EPAGE II criteria for surveillance after curative-intent CRC resection.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Endoscopic screening and removal of colorectal polyps are key strategies to prevent CRC death. Surveillance colonoscopy is required after polypectomy to detect and resect metachronous and previously misdiagnosed premalignant polyps. The intensity of surveillance is dependent on endoscopic and histological features of the polyp and also weighed against safety and burden; therefore, several guidelines were issued to classify risk levels of patients after colorectal polypectomy and standardize their follow-up interval, thereby preventing cancer and reducing CRC mortality.,

However, more than half of patients with a colorectal polyp resected do not receive surveillance colonoscopy within the recommended time. A study using clinical data found that the overall patient adherence was 48.9% to the 2020 US Multi-Society Task Force polypectomy surveillance guidelines. A large-scale multicenter studyfound that fewer than 25% of patients with adenoma had appropriate surveillance and that patients with delayed surveillance had a much higher rate of advanced neoplasia compared with patients with appropriate surveillance. Asid from patient factors, such as patient economic conditions and insurance-related issues, factors from the physician side are also associated with inappropriate postpolypectomy surveillance. First, physician knowledge and compliance with guidelines vary greatly, associated with heterogeneity in recommendations to patients. Second, the manual process for tracking patients with different surveillance intervals is energy- and time-consuming, inhibiting active follow-up from physicians and nurses, especially in medical resource–limited areas. Accurate identification of patients with different risk stratification and timely reminders is essential for increasing the surveillance rate of patients after polypectomy and thereby improving early diagnosis.

In patients with > 10 nonadvanced adenomas, colonoscopy surveillance in < 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y, with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. In patients with high adenoma volume, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 or 10 y. In patients with baseline nonadvanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and advanced adenoma colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American cancer society [^113Mcigd]. CA (2006). Low credibility.

Adenomatous polyps are the most common neoplastic findings uncovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or have a diagnostic workup for symptoms. It was common practice in the 1970s for these patients to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new adenomas as well as missed synchronous adenomas. As a result of the National Polyp Study report in 1993, which demonstrated clearly in a randomized design that the first postpolypectomy examination could be deferred for 3 years, guidelines published by a gastrointestinal consortium in 1997 recommended that the first follow-up surveillance be 3 years after polypectomy for most patients. In 2003, these guidelines were updated, colonoscopy was recommended as the only follow-up examination, and stratification at baseline into lower and higher risk for subsequent adenomas was suggested. The 1997 and 2003 guidelines dealt with both screening and surveillance. However, it has become increasingly clear that postpolypectomy surveillance is now a large part of endoscopic practice, draining resources from screening and diagnosis. In addition, surveys have demonstrated that a large proportion of endoscopists are conducting surveillance examinations at shorter intervals than recommended in the guidelines. In the present paper, a careful analytic approach was designed addressing all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be more definitely stratified at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either three or more adenomas, or high-grade dysplasia, or villous features, or an adenoma ≥ 1 cm in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have one or two small (< 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up in 5 to 10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up as average-risk people. Recent papers have reported a significant number of missed cancers by colonoscopy. However, high-quality baseline colonoscopy with excellent patient preparation and adequate withdrawal time should minimize this and reduce clinicians' concerns. These guidelines were developed jointly by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society to provide a broader consensus and thereby increase utilization of the recommendations by endoscopists. Adoption of these guidelines nationally can have a dramatic impact on shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening. It has been shown that the first screening colonoscopy and polypectomy produces the greatest effects on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps.

Main Recommendations

The following recommendations for post-polypectomy endoscopic surveillance should be applied only after a high quality baseline colonoscopy with complete removal of all detected neoplastic lesions.1 In the low risk group (patients with 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low grade dysplasia), the ESGE recommends participation in existing national screening programmes 10 years after the index colonoscopy. If no screening programme is available, repetition of colonoscopy 10 years after the index colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 2 In the high risk group (patients with adenomas with villous histology or high grade dysplasia or ≥ 10 mm in size, or ≥ 3 adenomas), the ESGE recommends surveillance colonoscopy 3 years after the index colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Patients with 10 or more adenomas should be referred for genetic counselling (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 3 In the high risk group, if no high risk adenomas are detected at the first surveillance examination, the ESGE suggests a 5-year interval before a second surveillance colonoscopy (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). If high risk adenomas are detected at first or subsequent surveillance examinations, a 3-year repetition of surveillance colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).4 The ESGE recommends that patients with serrated polyps < 10 mm in size with no dysplasia should be classified as low risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). The ESGE suggests that patients with large serrated polyps (≥ 10 mm) or those with dysplasia should be classified as high risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).5 The ESGE recommends that the endoscopist is responsible for providing a written recommendation for the post-polypectomy surveillance schedule (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

Colonoscopy quality assumptions — high quality is defined based on colonoscopist performance and examination-specific characteristics, including adequate adenoma detection rate (ADR), examination complete to cecum, attention to complete polypectomy, and adequate bowel preparation to reliably detect lesions > 5 mm; benchmarks for ADR (ADR > 30% in men; > 20% in women), proportion of examinations with adequate preparation (> 85%), and proportion of examinations complete to cecum (> 95%) should be universally and routinely monitored as colonoscopy quality metrics in practice; given the importance of polyp size for informing surveillance intervals, documentation of a polyp ≥ 10 mm within a report should be accompanied by an endoscopic photo of the polyp with comparison to an open snare or open biopsy forceps, and such documentation is important for HPs because small size (< 10 mm) is associated with well documented low risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia.

### Endoscopic resection and histological evaluation of colorectal polyps: is it a definitive treatment? [^113KuvQg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iishi et al studied patients with sessile polyps 2cm or greater. The polyps were resected by the endoscopic submucosal saline injection technique described above. Of the 56 polyps 25% were resected en bloc and 75% piecemeal. Of the patients who underwent piecemeal resection 55% required additional endoscopic or surgical intervention and the final cure rate was high (83–100%). Arterial bleeding was seen in 4 patients and in all but one it was successfully treated by clipping (one patient underwent laparotomy).

It is very important to emphasize the issue of follow-up colonoscopy in all patients with resected polypoid lesions. In our study, the follow-up period was too short to draw definitive conclusions about the prevention of a colorectal cancer. In the National Polyp Study a comparison was performed concerning follow-up colonoscopy 1 and 3 years and only 3 year after polypectomy, respectively. The authors concluded that there was no need for closer follow-up colonoscopy than 3 years after the first resection. However, in young people with positive family history for colorectal cancer a closer follow-up colonoscopy was recommended. In addition, in large pedunculated or sessile polyps follow-up colonoscopy should be performed every 3–6 months after the resection and in cases with cancer development every 3 months. In the present study, a careful analytic approach was designed to address all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be stratified more definitely at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower risk or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either 3 or more adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, villous features, or an adenoma 1 cm or larger in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have 1 or 2 small (< 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up evaluation in 5–10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up evaluation, as for average-risk people. Thus, in cases with resection of hyperplastic colonic polyps no further intervention is required one year later. However, it is now believed that there is a 'serrated pathway' to colorectal cancer that may involve some types of hyperplastic appearing polyps. The increasing recognition of these lesions and their potential to develop into cancer has led to an on-going re-evaluation of the role of hyperplastic-appearing polyps in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a high risk of adenoma formation has been reported in some of these patients.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — surveillance intervals after colonoscopy — patients harboring advanced precancerous lesions should have a follow-up colonoscopy ≤ 3 years after the index examination. In contrast, average-risk patients who undergo a high-quality colonoscopy negative for precancerous polyps or with only small distal hyperplastic polyps have a very low risk of future neoplasia and should not be rescreened for 10 years. There is also increasing evidence that patients with 1–2 small adenomas (and especially 1–2 diminutive adenomas) are not at significantly elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and endoscopists should consider assigning a 10-year follow-up interval for this group as well.

### Sessile serrated adenomas: high-risk lesions? [^113N2MHR]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) were unrecognized in pathology and gastroenterology practice until about 2005; we have diagnosed them since 2001, allowing up to 10 years of follow-up. We evaluated follow-up of patients with sessile serrated adenoma diagnosed between 2002 and 2004 in our teaching institution and compared it to follow-up of randomly selected tubular adenomas. Materials from patients diagnosed with sessile serrated adenoma from January 2002 to December 2004 were reviewed. A control group of patients with sporadic tubular adenomas was selected. Ninety-nine sessile serrated adenomas from 93 patients were diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2004. Forty three patients (46.2%) had follow-up colonoscopy. One or more lesions were found in 42 (97.6%) of 43 patients. Mucinous adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 1 (2.3%) of 43 patients, and 1 (2.3%) of 43 patients had high-grade dysplasia in an sessile serrated adenoma. Sessile serrated adenomas were found in 22 (51.2%) of 43 patients, 16 (37.2%) of 43 patients had tubular adenomas, and hyperplastic polyps were diagnosed in 18 (41.9%) of 43. Ninety-two patients with tubular adenomas between January 2002 and December 2004 formed the control group. Sixty-six patients (71.7%) received follow-up colonoscopy. Most (53/66, 80.3%) patients had tubular adenomas on follow-up, 12 (18.2%) of 66 patients had hyperplastic polyps, and 2 (3.0%) of 66 patients had a sessile serrated adenoma. The follow-up of sessile serrated adenomas from the study period (2002 to 2004) was more rigorous than proposed for sporadic tubular adenomas (patients with sporadic tubular adenomas were also followed up more aggressively than suggested by guidelines). Those with follow-up were managed as per advanced adenomas; their clinical outcomes supported this. These results suggest that guidelines for following up patients with sessile serrated adenomas as per advanced adenomas are warranted.

### Colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy and colorectal cancer resection [^113dhZej]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

This article describes a joint update of guidelines by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer delineating evidence-based surveillance recommendations for patients after polypectomy and colorectal cancer resection. Although there are some qualifying conditions, the following general guidelines apply: after colonoscopic polypectomy, patients with hyperplastic polyps should be considered to have normal colonoscopies, and subsequent colonoscopy is recommended at 10 years. Patients with one or two small (less than 1 cm) tubular adenomas, including those with only low-grade dysplasia, should have their next colonoscopy in five to 10 years. Patients with three to 10 adenomas, any adenoma 1 cm or larger, or any adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia should have their next colonoscopy in three years. Following curative resection of colorectal cancer, patients should undergo a colonoscopy at one year, with subsequent follow-up intervals determined by the results of this examination. Adoption of these guidelines will have a dramatic impact on the quality of care provided to patients after a colorectal cancer diagnosis, will assist in shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening, and will ultimately decrease suffering and death related to colorectal cancer.

Colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy — PICO questions define comparisons and populations for surveillance intervals as follows: in patients with normal colonoscopy, whether repeat colonoscopy at 10 y is preferred to earlier surveillance and whether no repeat colonoscopy is preferred to colonoscopy at 10 y or earlier; in patients with 1–2 small (< 10 mm) nonadvanced adenomas, whether surveillance is preferred to no surveillance and whether surveillance at 5 y is preferred to surveillance at 10 y; in patients with sessile serrated adenoma/polyp size ≥ 10 mm and/or with dysplasia, whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to surveillance at 5 or 10 y; and in those with sessile serrated adenoma/polyp size < 10 mm with no dysplasia, whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to surveillance at 5 or 10 y; in patients with advanced adenoma, defined as adenoma with ≥ 10 mm, villous histology, and/or high-grade dysplasia, whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to surveillance at 5 or 10 y; and separately, for patients with adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size, those with adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia, or adenoma containing villous histology, whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to surveillance at 5 or 10 y. Across questions, outcomes include detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality.

Proximal adenoma — Evidence is insufficient to recommend differential management for patients with proximal adenoma (Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Among patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm in size, having at least 1 proximal adenoma was associated with increased risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia in a pooled analysis of 7 prospective studies; another study reported that having at least one proximal adenoma was associated with 1.17-fold increased risk for any metachronous adenoma but no increased risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia. A Netherlands cohort of 2990 patients diagnosed from 1988 to 2002 and followed through 2008 found proximal location associated with a 1.6-fold increased risk for advanced adenoma at follow-up, whereas another study found similar risk for incident CRC among individuals with 1–2 proximal only or distal only adenomas < 10 mm in size. Taken together, more research is needed to determine whether proximal adenoma location should be considered as a specific factor for modifying surveillance recommendations.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113ByfEp]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for polyp surveillance after first surveillance colonoscopy — For baseline LRA, the interval for second surveillance is 3 years if first surveillance shows HRA, 5 years if LRA, and 10 years if no adenoma; for baseline HRA, the interval for second surveillance is 3 years if first surveillance shows HRA, 5 years if LRA, and 5 years if no adenoma (footnote a applies). We believe that patients with LRA at baseline and negative findings at first surveillance can have their next surveillance examination at 10 years, while patients who have HRA at any examination appear to remain at high risk and should have shorter follow-up intervals for surveillance. HRA is defined as 3 or more adenomas, tubular adenoma ≥ 10 mm, adenoma with villous histology, or HGD, and LRA is defined as 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm. If the findings on the second surveillance are negative, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Low-risk adenoma surveillance risk evidence — two meta-analyses and supporting cohorts indicate low absolute metachronous advanced neoplasia rates and no excess colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality versus reference groups. In pooled data of 11,387 individuals across 7 studies with 2–5 years of follow-up, metachronous advanced neoplasia was 3.6% with baseline low-risk adenoma versus 1.6% with normal colonoscopy (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.6). A more recent meta-analysis pooling 10,139 individuals across 8 studies with 3–10 years of follow-up found 5-year cumulative metachronous advanced neoplasia of 4.9% for low-risk adenoma (95% CI, 3.18%–6.97%) vs 3.3% with no adenoma (95% CI, 1.85%–5.10%; RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.24–1.94). Cohorts also reported a standardized mortality ratio of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63–0.88) after a single adenoma without advanced histology, reduced CRC risk with baseline nonadvanced adenoma (SIR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.44–0.99), and among those exposed to surveillance after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm SIR, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.30–1.07) vs SIR, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.41–1.47) in unexposed; a US cohort observed cumulative CRC incidence up to 15 years of 1.4% in nonadvanced adenoma vs 1.2% with no adenoma.

Risk after repeat colonoscopy — Across all studies, individuals with low-risk adenoma at baseline and no adenoma at first surveillance had low rates of high-risk adenoma on follow-up, ranging from 1% to 6.6%. Similarly, across all but one of the studies reviewed, individuals with high-risk adenoma at both baseline and subsequent surveillance examination have ≥ 18% rate of metachronous high-risk adenoma on follow-up, supporting our recommendation for follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years.

Surveillance interval and risk modifiers after 1–2 small/nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm: In pooled prospective surveillance data, metachronous advanced neoplasia risk was higher with a history of polyps (absolute risk, 11.5%) or with concurrent distal and proximal small adenomas (absolute risk, 11.0%), and in a separate study of 4496 patients proximal-only vs distal-only lesions had similar incident CRC risk (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.7–2.8); the authors considered a recommendation of 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm in size, but state that The 7- to 10-year range was chosen due to uncertainty and possible surveillance effects, note that many such patients previously had a prior documented recommendation for a 5-year examination or other interval shorter than 7–10 years, and anticipate that characteristics such as size < 6 mm may help guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs longer 10-year surveillance interval.

US Multi‑Society Task Force — hyperplastic polyps (HPs) surveillance after colonoscopy: For patients with ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps (HPs) < 10 mm in size in the rectum or sigmoid colon removed at a high‑quality examination, repeat colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in 10 years (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For patients with ≤ 20 HPs < 10 mm in size proximal to the sigmoid colon removed at a high‑quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 10 years (Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The Task Force notes no published studies on risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia or large serrated polyps among isolated proximal HPs < 10 mm without synchronous conventional adenoma and cites a cohort where among 698 patients with HPs and no concurrent conventional adenomas, high‑risk adenoma at follow‑up was 3.7% (26 of 698) and large serrated polyp was 1.6% (11 of 698); if distinguishing sessile serrated polyp (SSP) from HP is uncertain, clinicians may choose to follow SSP recommendations for isolated proximal HPs < 10 mm.

Colonoscopy surveillance — bowel preparation quality and repeat timing is specified for baseline examinations with suboptimal preparation. Current quality indicators target preparation adequate for detection of lesions > 5 mm, and splitting the dose of bowel preparation is strongly encouraged by the MSTF. If the bowel preparation is poor, the MSTF recommends that in most cases the examination should be repeated within 1 year; intervals shorter than 1 year are indicated when advanced neoplasia is detected. If the bowel preparation is fair but adequate to detect lesions > 5 mm and if small (< 10 mm) tubular adenomas are detected, follow-up at 5 years should be considered.

### Factors associated with shorter colonoscopy surveillance intervals for patients with low-risk colorectal adenomas and effects on outcome [^1147g7Ng]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Endoscopists do not routinely follow guidelines to survey individuals with low-risk adenomas (LRAs; 1–2 small tubular adenomas, < 1 cm) every 5–10 years for colorectal cancer; many recommend shorter surveillance intervals for these individuals. We aimed to identify the reasons that endoscopists recommend shorter surveillance intervals for some individuals with LRAs and determine whether timing affects outcomes at follow-up examinations.

Methods

We collected data from 1560 individuals (45–75 years old) who participated in a prospective chemoprevention trial (of vitamin D and calcium) from 2004 through 2008. Participants in the trial had at least 1 adenoma, detected at their index colonoscopy, and were recommended to receive follow-up colonoscopy examinations at 3 or 5 years after adenoma identification, as recommended by the endoscopist. For this analysis we collected data from only participants with LRAs. These data included characteristics of participants and endoscopists and findings from index and follow-up colonoscopies. Primary endpoints were frequency of recommending shorter (3-year) vs longer (5-year) surveillance intervals, factors associated with these recommendations, and effect on outcome, determined at the follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

A 3-year surveillance interval was recommended for 594 of the subjects (38.1%). Factors most significantly associated with recommendation of 3-year vs a 5-year surveillance interval included African American race (relative risk [RR] to white, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.75), Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity (RR to white, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.22–2.43), detection of 2 adenomas at the index examination (RR vs 1 adenoma, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27–1.71), more than 3 serrated polyps at the index examination (RR = 2.16, 95% CI, 1.59–2.93), or index examination with fair or poor quality bowel preparation (RR vs excellent quality, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.66–2.83). Other factors that had a significant association with recommendation for a 3-year surveillance interval included family history of colorectal cancer and detection of 1–2 serrated polyps at the index examination. In comparisons of outcomes, we found no significant differences between the 3-year vs 5-year recommendation groups in proportions of subjects found to have 1 or more adenomas (38.8% vs 41.7% respectively; p = 0.27), advanced adenomas (7.7% vs 8.2%; p = 0.73) or clinically significant serrated polyps (10.0% vs 10.3%; p = 0.82) at the follow-up colonoscopy.

Conclusions

Possibly influenced by patients' family history, race, quality of bowel preparation, or number or size of polyps, endoscopists frequently recommend 3-year surveillance intervals instead of guideline-recommended intervals of 5 years or longer for individuals with LRAs. However, at the follow-up colonoscopy, similar proportions of participants have 1 or more adenomas, advanced adenomas, or serrated polyps. These findings support the current guideline recommendations of performing follow-up examinations of individuals with LRAs at least 5 years after the index colonoscopy.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^112vrGs4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force update — post-polypectomy surveillance risk stratification states that evidence after normal colonoscopy has strengthened the recommendation to defer repeat screening for at least 10 years and that polyp features guide intervals. Patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower-than-average risk for incident and fatal CRC and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, whereas individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population CRC risk; emerging data support less frequent surveillance among those with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm. A combination of serrated lesions and conventional adenomas appears to confer higher risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia, and 2 studies suggest surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce incident CRC among high-risk patients, although more data are needed to prove incremental benefits for incidence and mortality reduction.

Surveillance colonoscopy after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce risk for incident CRC, but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain. In a UK cohort of patients with intermediate-risk adenomas defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years, 42% did not receive surveillance; exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with reduced incident CRC (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72 and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37–0.74). Risk for incident CRC was independently associated with increasing age, adenoma ≥ 20 mm in size, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, proximal adenoma, incomplete baseline examination, and poor bowel preparation. In a higher-risk subgroup, absolute incident CRC was 2.8% with vs 3.3% without surveillance (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.75), whereas among those not meeting higher-risk criteria it was 0.7% vs 1.1% with a nonstatistically significant reduction (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20–1.43); mortality was not assessed.
