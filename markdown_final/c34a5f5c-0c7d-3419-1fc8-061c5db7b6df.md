## Question

What did the CHOICE trial show about intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the CHOICE trial showed about intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the intervention and dosing. Next, I will examine the primary and key secondary outcomes, including safety. After that, I need to check the mechanistic imaging substudy. I should then consider limitations and how they affect interpretation. Finally, I will integrate CHOICE into the broader evidence base and outline clinical implications and uncertainties that remain.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't misstate the context. CHOICE was a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Catalonia, Spain, that enrolled patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke who achieved successful reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy, defined as eTICI 2b50 to 3, within 24 hours of onset, and excluded those with contraindications to IV alteplase, very high NIHSS, or complete recovery in the angiography suite, which frames the generalizability of the results [^417dfd63] [^74275593].

> I need to verify the intervention and dosing next. The active treatment was intra-arterial alteplase 0.225 mg/kg, maximum 22.5 mg, infused over 15 to 30 minutes via a microcatheter positioned in the target vessel, compared with placebo, administered immediately after successful thrombectomy, which is a quarter of the standard IV alteplase dose and reflects a local, targeted pharmacologic strategy rather than systemic exposure [^417dfd63] [^77e9d6cb].

> Now, let me examine the primary outcome and make sure I cite the exact figures. The primary endpoint, excellent functional outcome at 90 days defined as mRS 0–1, occurred in 59.0% with intra-arterial alteplase versus 40.4% with placebo, yielding an adjusted risk difference of 18.4% with a 95% CI of 0.3% to 36.4% and P = 0.047, indicating a statistically significant benefit on this stringent outcome threshold [^417dfd63] [^488d03a0].

> Hold on, I should verify safety outcomes before drawing conclusions. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours was 0% with alteplase versus 3.8% with placebo, and 90-day mortality was 8% with alteplase versus 15% with placebo, though the mortality difference did not reach statistical significance, which together suggest no excess hemorrhage signal and a favorable mortality trend in this small study [^417dfd63] [^77e9d6cb].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic imaging substudy to ensure the clinical signal aligns with biology. In a nested MRI cohort, adjunct intra-arterial alteplase reduced the prevalence of hypoperfusion at 48 hours from 58% to 24% versus placebo, with particularly striking reductions even in patients achieving eTICI 3, supporting the concept that distal emboli and no-reflow contribute to suboptimal outcomes despite angiographic success, and that local lysis can mitigate these deficits [^018c451b] [^3d0631dd].

> Wait, let me verify limitations so I don't overstate certainty. The trial was terminated early for logistical reasons and enrolled only 121 patients, with 113 treated as randomized, so the sample is small and the study was underpowered for some secondary analyses; additionally, the population was predominantly White and from a single region, and the agent and dose are not yet standard, so external validity and optimal dosing remain uncertain pending replication [^417dfd63] [^488d03a0].

> I will now examine how CHOICE fits into the broader randomized evidence base to contextualize its signal. Multiple meta-analyses pooling RCTs of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful reperfusion show a consistent increase in excellent functional outcomes (mRS 0–1) without excess symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or mortality, with pooled estimates around a 20–25% relative increase and low heterogeneity, which strengthens confidence in a true effect despite individual trial size limitations [^8ba27d02] [^f22db334] [^84cc006e] [^83444e6c].

> But wait, what if different thrombolytics behave differently; I should double-check agent-specific signals. Network meta-analyses and pooled analyses suggest alteplase may have the strongest effect size among tested agents, whereas tenecteplase shows smaller or neutral effects in some trials, and urokinase has not shown benefit in the POST-UK RCT, underscoring that agent selection and dosing likely matter and that ongoing trials comparing doses and agents are warranted [^6f4cf311] [^83444e6c] [^b07c8601] [^c6578181].

> Let me consider clinical implications carefully and avoid jumping to routine adoption. The CHOICE signal is promising and biologically coherent, but current guidelines do not endorse routine intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy outside trials, and expert reviews emphasize equipoise pending larger confirmatory studies; therefore, best practice remains enrollment in ongoing RCTs such as CHOICE-2, with selective off-label use considered only in carefully chosen patients after multidisciplinary review and with informed consent [^e59d5089] [^8d23a21d] [^5096123f] [^e69c7023].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The CHOICE trial demonstrated that adjunct intra-arterial alteplase at 0.225 mg/kg after successful thrombectomy increased the likelihood of excellent 90-day functional outcomes by about 18% without increasing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, supported by MRI evidence of improved distal perfusion, but the evidence is preliminary due to early termination and small size, so routine use is not yet recommended and should be reserved for trials or carefully selected cases until larger RCTs replicate and refine patient selection, dosing, and agent choice [^417dfd63] [^018c451b] [^8ba27d02] [^5096123f].

The CHOICE trial showed that adjunctive intra-arterial alteplase after successful thrombectomy **increased excellent functional outcomes** (mRS 0–1) at 90 days from 40.4% to 59.0% (adjusted risk difference 18.4%; 95% CI 0.3–36.4; P = 0.047) [^417dfd63] without increasing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (0% vs 3.8% with placebo) [^417dfd63] or 90-day mortality (8% vs 15%) [^417dfd63]. The benefit was observed despite similar angiographic reperfusion, suggesting improved microvascular perfusion [^3d0631dd] [^018c451b]. However, the trial was stopped early and was underpowered; thus, **routine use is not yet recommended** pending larger confirmatory studies [^5096123f] [^e69c7023].

## Study design and patient population

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial [^417dfd63].
- **Population**: 121 patients with LVO AIS who achieved successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b50–3) after thrombectomy within 24 hours of onset [^417dfd63].
- **Intervention**: Intra-arterial alteplase 0.225 mg/kg (max 22.5 mg) over 15–30 minutes vs placebo [^417dfd63].
- **Primary outcome**: mRS 0–1 at 90 days [^417dfd63].

---

## Key findings

| **Outcome** | **Intra-arterial alteplase** | **Placebo** | **Adjusted risk difference (95% ci)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| mRS 0–1 at 90 days | 59.0% (36/61) | 40.4% (21/52) | 18.4% (0.3–36.4); P = 0.047 [^417dfd63] |
| Symptomatic ICH within 24 hours | 0% (0/61) | 3.8% (2/52) | -3.8% (-13.2 to 2.5) [^417dfd63] |
| 90-day mortality | 8% (5/61) | 15% (8/52) | -7.2% (-19.2 to 4.8) [^417dfd63] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Functional benefit**: Significant increase in excellent outcomes (mRS 0–1) without more sICH or mortality [^417dfd63].
- **Mechanism**: Benefit despite similar angiographic reperfusion implies improved microvascular perfusion and reduced no-reflow [^3d0631dd] [^018c451b].
- **Safety**: No excess sICH or mortality, supporting feasibility and safety in selected patients [^417dfd63].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Sample size**: Small, early-terminated trial; underpowered for definitive conclusions [^417dfd63].
- **Generalizability**: Single-region, predominantly White population; broader validation needed [^417dfd63].
- **Routine use**: Not yet recommended; larger RCTs are underway to confirm efficacy and define patient selection [^5096123f] [^e69c7023].

---

## Current clinical practice and guidelines

Current guidelines **do not recommend routine** adjunctive intra-arterial alteplase after successful thrombectomy outside trials [^e59d5089] [^8d23a21d]. Ongoing trials (e.g. CHOICE-2) aim to clarify efficacy, dosing, and selection [^e69c7023].

---

The CHOICE trial suggests that adjunctive intra-arterial alteplase after successful thrombectomy can **improve excellent functional outcomes** without increasing sICH or mortality, but routine adoption awaits larger confirmatory studies [^417dfd63] [^5096123f].

### Effect of intra-arterial alteplase vs placebo following successful thrombectomy on functional outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the CHOICE randomized clinical trial [^417dfd63]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is estimated that only 27% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion who undergo successful reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy are disability free at 90 days. An incomplete microcirculatory reperfusion might contribute to these suboptimal clinical benefits.

Objective

To investigate whether treatment with adjunct intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy improves outcomes following reperfusion.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from December 2018 through May 2021 in 7 stroke centers in Catalonia, Spain. The study included 121 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset and with an expanded Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia angiographic score of 2b50 to 3.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive intra-arterial alteplase (0.225 mg/kg; maximum dose, 22.5 mg) infused over 15 to 30 minutes (n = 61) or placebo (n = 52).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients achieving a score of 0 or 1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) in all patients treated as randomized. Safety outcomes included rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and death.

Results

The study was terminated early for inability to maintain placebo availability and enrollment rate because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 1825 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy at the 7 study sites, 748 (41%) patients fulfilled the angiographic criteria, 121 (7%) patients were randomized (mean age, 70.6 [SD, 13.7] years; 57 women [47%]), and 113 (6%) were treated as randomized. The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 59.0% (36/61) with alteplase and 40.4% (21/52) with placebo (adjusted risk difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-36.4%; P = 0.047). The proportion of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours was 0% with alteplase and 3.8% with placebo (risk difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 2.5%). Ninety-day mortality was 8% with alteplase and 15% with placebo (risk difference, -7.2%; 95% CI, -19.2% to 4.8%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication.

### Effect of intra-arterial alteplase vs placebo following successful thrombectomy on functional outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the CHOICE randomized clinical trial [^77e9d6cb]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study CHOICE (alteplase) was published by Arturo Renú and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of intra-arterial alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion AIS? In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the population was: 113 patients (52 female, 61 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with large vessel occlusion AIS and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to the use of intravenous alteplase; NIHSS score on admission > 25; complete clinical recovery in the angiography suite during the procedure. In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the interventions were: n = 61 alteplase (intra-arterial infusion of a dose of 0.225 mg/kg over 15–30 minutes) n = 52 placebo (intra-arterial infusion of a matching placebo over 15 minutes). In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in patients with mRS score of < 2 at 90 days (59% vs. 40.4%; AD 18.4%, 95% CI 0.3 to 36.4). In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in patients with improved angiographic eTICI score (8.5% vs. 7.7%; AD 0.6%, 95% CI -9.5 to 10.7) No significant difference in patients with infarct expansion (63.9% vs. 74.5%; ARD -8.9, 95% CI -25.6 to 7.9) No significant difference in patients with ischemic worsening (1.6% vs. 5.8%; ARD -4.9, 95% CI -18 to 8.3). In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic ICH, death at day 90. In the CHOICE (alteplase) study, the conclusion was: in patients with large vessel occlusion AIS and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, alteplase was superior to placebo with respect to patients with mRS score of < 2 at 90 days.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^c95f6cb6]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The Effect of Intra-Arterial Alteplase vs Placebo Following Successful Thrombectomy on Functional Outcomes in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Acute Ischemic Stroke (CHOICE) trial, which investigated the effects of intra-arterial alteplase vs placebo after successful thrombectomy in patients with LVO acute ischemic stroke, demonstrated the potential benefit of administering intra-arterial alteplase at a dose equivalent to one-quarter of the standard intravenous thrombolytic dose. To our knowledge, studies that include a dose-escalation exploratory component are limited, leaving the optimal dose that balances efficacy and safety undetermined.

Tenecteplase is a modified form of alteplase that has been shown to have equal safety and better functional outcomes compared with alteplase. Given the differences of tenecteplase compared with alteplase, adjunctive intra-arterial administration of tenecteplase may provide greater benefit for patients with LVO stroke after successful EVT. However, the optimal dose, efficacy, and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion is unknown. The Safety and Efficacy of Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Successful Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion (DATE) trial was a phase 1b and 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion by EVT in patients with anterior circulation LVO presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset.

Results

Study Selection and Evaluation

The initial database search yielded a total of 4,058 records, including 147 from the CENTRAL, 1,257 from Embase, 2,602 from PubMed, and 52 from. After a comprehensive screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicate entries, we refined the list to 3,146 studies. During the screening of titles and abstracts, 3,044 records were excluded, leaving 102 records that were assessed in full text to confirm their eligibility. Finally, 4 published studies and 2 unpublished studies (NCT05624190 and NCT05856851) were included in our quantitative synthesis (Figure 1). A total of 1,985 patients who were initially enrolled were included in this analysis.

Study Characteristics

A comprehensive summary of the baseline characteristics of the 6 included studies is presented in Table 1 and eTable 2. The CHOICE trial used double-blind study design, and the other 5 trials used open-label, blinded endpoint study design. The ATTENTION-IA trial enrolled patients with acute posterior large vessel occlusion stroke while the other 5 trials enrolled patients with LVO stroke in anterior circulation. The CHOICE trial was conducted among White patients in Spain while the other 5 trials were conducted among eastern Asian patients in China. It is worth mentioning that we extracted data of Intra-arterial Tenecteplase After Successful Endovascular Therapy (ANGEL-TNK) and Intra-arterial Alteplase for Acute Ischaemic Stroke After Mechanical Thrombectomy (PEARL) from Virtual Support of International Stroke Conference 2025.

Material and methods

Study population

The model included patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral artery, who were treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after the point when they were last seen well, and had a post-thrombectomy eTICI score of 2b50 or greater as judged by local investigators.

Ethics approval

This model-based study does not involve human participants. Ethics approval was not applicable.

Clinical inputs

The CHOICE trial assessed the preliminary efficacy and safety of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase treatment compared with placebo in patients with LVO acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy that resulted in successful reperfusion on digital subtraction angiography. The CHOICE trial is currently the only randomized controlled trial available assessing adjunct intra-arterial alteplase treatment. The trial was conducted in seven study sites in Spain. One hundred twenty-one patients were randomized in the CHOICE trial, of whom 113 received their randomized study treatment. Based on local investigator assessment, 65 (58%) had an eTICI score of 2b50/67 and 48 (42%) had an eTICI score of 2c/3 at the time of randomization.

Model structure

To forecast the direct medical costs and effectiveness of treating patients with adjunctive intra-arterial alteplase versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO undergoing an angiographically successful endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, a short-term decision tree (90 days) and a lifetime (20 years) state transition Markov model were designed, to align with typically used time horizons. A Markov model simulates disease progression through distinct health states (eg, disability levels) where transitions depend only on the current state, not prior history, using probabilities, costs and outcomes assigned to each state. This model was developed using Microsoft Excel V.2401.

The short-term decision tree was built up to evaluate both cost and clinical effectiveness. Patient allocation to receive adjunctive intra-arterial alteplase treatment was determined through a decision tree model and anticipated 3-month post-treatment mRS scores were derived from data in the CHOICE trial. Although this trial was stopped prematurely, it is the only data available that allow the economic evaluation of treating distal secondary medium-vessel occlusions as well as the no reflow phenomenon with intra-arterial alteplase after successful reperfusion with endovascular reperfusion. The mRS serves as a standardized functional assessment utilizing a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (indicating no disability) to 6 (reflecting mortality).

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^2cefe40f]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Current trials, such as Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (POST-TNK), Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase After Successful Endovascular Therapy (ANGEL-TNK), and Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Mechanical Thrombectomy (ALLY), explored various dosing regimens of intra-arterial tenecteplase, specifically 0.0625 mg/kg, 0.1250 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg to 4.5 mg, respectively. These doses were selected based on established fractions of the intravenous alteplase dose used in previous studies like the CHOICE trial, or through recommendations from trial steering committees, rather than through systematic dose-escalation studies. The insights gained from the DATE study accordingly provide important data for empirically defining the optimal dose to enhance patient safety and patient outcomes and refine stroke treatment protocols. This systematic approach may ultimately contribute to a more effective management of acute ischemic stroke in the context of EVT.

The advent of studies of dosing strategies for intra-arterial lytic agents after successful EVT highlights a gap in our pharmacologic understanding of optimal dosing for intra-arterial administration. Unlike intravenous thrombolytic administration of drug, where dosing has been extensively studied and standardized, intra-arterial administration requires careful consideration of distinct pharmacokinetics, local drug concentration at the site of occlusion, and patient-specific factors. The intricacies of intra-arterial drug delivery may necessitate a more tailored approach to determine the most effective and safe dose.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis following endovascular recanalization for large vessel occlusion stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6bb61266]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been proven and recommended as the preferred treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), with improved functional outcomes, while only approximately 30% of patients achieved disability-free status at 90 days after recanalization. Despite successful recanalization and apparent restoration of blood flow in large vessels, hypoperfusion after EVT, commonly referred to as the "no-reflow phenomenon", frequently occurs, indicating poor microvascular reperfusion. This phenomenon, along with early arterial re-occlusion, may contribute to suboptimal outcomes, highlighting the need for additional strategies to enhance patient recovery after endovascular recanalization.

Although intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) after endovascular recanalization has shown potential in improving functional outcomes by dissolving residual thrombi in distal arteries and the microcirculation, its overall impact remains uncertain because of conflicting findings from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy (CHOICE) and Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase after Successful Endovascular Recanalisation in Patients with Acute Posterior Circulation Arterial Occlusion (ATTENTION) trials demonstrated that IAT improved the odds of achieving excellent outcomes without increasing the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), while the Adjunctive Intra-arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (POST-TNK) and Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Urokinase After Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Acute Ischemic Stroke (POST-UK) trials reported no significant benefit. Furthermore, it is unclear whether patient-related treatment effect modifiers, such as age, sex, or baseline stroke severity, influence the efficacy of IAT because individual trials lacked sufficient events to provide conclusive insights. Although meta-analyses pooling observational studies have attempted to address this uncertainty, these analyses are inherently limited by study design biases and small sample sizes. Limited data exist on synthesizing data exclusively from RCTs, and evidence regarding the comprehensive impact of IAT on clinical outcomes remains inadequate.

We, therefore, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the results of RCTs, comparing the efficacy and safety of IAT vs control in patients with AIS due to LVO to estimate the effects of improving functional outcomes by IAT in the overall population and prespecified potential prognostic subgroups.

### Cost-effectiveness of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful thrombectomy [^56bf5b18]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Intra-arterial thrombolysis (IA lysis) addresses distal embolization and the no-reflow phenomenon — persistent microvascular ischemia despite angiographic reperfusion — after successful endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), which achieves reperfusion graded by the expanded Treatment In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scores (eg, 3 = 100%, 2c = 90–99%, 2b50 = 50–66%). While higher eTICI scores correlate with better outcomes, multiple attempts to achieve complete reperfusion increase complications, and IA lysis (using agents like alteplase) offers a safe adjunct to mitigate these issues without elevating haemorrhage risk. The Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy (CHOICE) trial evaluated whether IA alteplase after successful thrombectomy could further improve outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. The trial was halted prematurely due to slow recruitment and logistical challenges, resulting in a smaller-than-planned sample size.

Despite the promising results of the CHOICE trial, the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive IA lysis remains unknown. The substantial treatment effects observed in large vessel thrombectomy EVT trials have made one of the few medical interventions that both improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. This effect is primarily driven by lower long-term nursing expenses. The impact of the CHOICE trial was particularly notable in the lower range of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), specifically, a shift from a good to an excellent outcome. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the additional administration of alteplase after EVT represents a potentially efficient allocation of resources.

The aim of this study is to conduct a model-based analysis of the cost-effectiveness of IA lysis as an adjunctive treatment for patients who have undergone endovascular treatment for large-vessel occlusion stroke across seven countries based on the results of the CHOICE trial.

All-Cause Mortality at 90 days

The incidence of 90-day mortality was reported in all included 6 studies. Our result showed that the 90-day mortality was comparable between the IAT group (181 of 990 [18.3%]) and the control group (180 of 981 [18.3%]), with a calculated RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.83–1.21; p = 0.994), suggesting no significant difference between the 2 groups (Figure 3). No heterogeneity was detected among the included studies, with I² = 0.0% and p = 0.453.

*The data for clinically symptomatic or any intracranial hemorrhage were within 24 hours in the CHOICE trial. ANGEL-TNK = Intra-arterial Tenecteplase After Successful Endovascular Therapy; ATTENTION = Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase after Successful Endovascular Recanalisation in Patients with Acute Posterior Circulation Arterial Occlusion; CHOICE = Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy; eTICI = expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction; PEARL = Intra-arterial Alteplase for Acute Ischaemic Stroke After Mechanical Thrombectomy; POST-TNK = Adjunctive Intra-arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke; POST-UK = Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Urokinase After Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage Within 48 Hours

Data regarding the rates of sICH were provided by all 6 studies, encompassing a total of 1,971 patients. The overall frequency of sICH was 5.06% in the IAT group (50 of 989), compared with 4.48% in the control group (44 of 982). The calculated RR for sICH was 1.14 (95% CI 0.76–1.70; p = 0.525), with no significant difference identified between the 2 groups (Figure 3). There was no observed statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I² = 0.0%, p = 0.520).

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular recanalisation in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion (ATTENTION-IA): multicentre randomised controlled trial [^ae139ce8]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

We observed a nominally more favourable overall prognosis compared to the ATTENTION trial. Among patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, the proportion with a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1 in the ATTENTION trial was 16%, whereas in the ATTENTION-IA trial this proportion increased to 25% at 90 days. Additionally, the mortality rate decreased from 40% in the ATTENTION trial to 25% in the ATTENTION-IA trial. This might be because ATTENTION-IA included patients with NIHSS scores of 6–9 as well as those with occlusion of the P1 segment of the proximal posterior cerebral artery (comprising 15.0% and 4.8% of the total participants, respectively). Another factor was that nearly all patients achieved successful recanalisation in the ATTENTION-IA trial compared with 93% in the ATTENTION trial. However, given the neutral results in our trial compared with the statistically significant findings observed in the CHOICE trial, future trials might also consider utilising alteplase as the intra-arterial thrombolytic agent.

Unlike the CHOICE trial, which restricted stenting due to the requirement for dual antiplatelet treatment, the ATTENTION-IA trial permitted stent placement. This decision was made because of the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis as the underlying mechanism for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion in China. Consequently, stent placement was deemed necessary in many patients to maintain flow of the occluded arteries. Despite the inclusion of stenting in our trial, we found that the results were not significantly altered. Subgroup analysis, comparing patients who underwent stenting with those who did not, revealed similar proportions of patients with modified Rankin scale scores of 0 or 1 at 90 days (P = 0.56).

Consistent with the CHOICE trial, our study did not exclude patients who had received intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular treatment. Our analysis revealed no evidence indicating an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage associated with intra-arterial tenecteplase use after endovascular treatment in patients who had previously received intravenous thrombolysis.

Conclusions

Low certainty evidence suggests that there is possibly a small decrease in the proportion of patients that achieve functional independence and a small increase in mortality with EVT alone. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that there is probably a small decrease in sICH with EVT alone. The accompanying guideline provides contextualised guidance based on this body of evidence.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular recanalisation in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion (ATTENTION-IA): multicentre randomised controlled trial [^837776ae]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results of this multicentre randomised trial suggested that intra-arterial tenecteplase use after successful endovascular treatment resulted in similar functional outcomes and mortality at 90 days to endovascular treatment alone in patients presenting with acute intracranial occlusions of the posterior circulation in the vertebral artery, basilar artery, or P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. The rates of the primary endpoint of excellent outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0 or 1) at 90 days were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was numerically higher in patients who received intra-arterial tenecteplase.

The results for the secondary outcomes and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result for the primary outcome. All multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, pre-stroke modified Rankin scale score, time from onset to randomisation, hypertension, and baseline NIHSS score. Subgroup analyses did not suggest a statistically significant difference between study arms by time to endovascular treatment, stroke subtype, or whether intravenous thrombolysis was or was not administered before endovascular treatment.

Comparison with other studies

We chose tenecteplase over alteplase as the thrombolytic agent to administer after thrombectomy. Its enhanced fibrin specificity and prolonged half life make tenecteplase a more suitable single bolus option than alteplase after endovascular thrombectomy. The tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trial showed the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in recanalisation of acute large vessel occlusion before thrombectomy. A retrospective analysis comparing 33 patients who received intra-arterial tenecteplase with 48 patients who received intra-arterial alteplase suggested a trend towards better clinical outcomes with tenecteplase, with no discernible difference in haemorrhage rates between the two thrombolytic agents. The phase IIb adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase following mechanical thrombectomy pilot trial (ALLY) of 20 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion and had a final eTICI grade of 2b or 2c not amenable to further mechanical retrieval showed intra-arterial tenecteplase (1.5–4.5 mg) to be a safe adjunct to thrombectomy, with one (5%) symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage event. Moreover, a series of acute stroke trials have shown non-inferior or even superior angiographic and clinical outcomes from intravenous tenecteplase use compared with intravenous alteplase.

Assessment of certainty of evidence

The authors and the guideline panel achieved consensus in categorising the certainty of evidence for all reported outcomes as high, moderate, low or very low using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. With the GRADE approach, RCTs start as high certainty evidence, but may be rated down for risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistencyor publication bias. We also rated down significant effects for imprecision if they were informed by < 300 patients for continuous outcomes or < 300 events for dichotomised outcomes. We did not rate down for risk of bias if the only criterion not met was blinding of study participants or personnel on the basis that a recent meta-epidemiological study found no evidence for an average difference in estimated treatment effect between trials with and without blinded patients, healthcare providers or outcome assessors. We also did not rate down the same effect estimate two times for both inconsistency and imprecision.

Rating of imprecision was fully contextualised by the guideline panel, and we followed GRADE guidance for communicating our findings. We presented our evidence syntheses in a GRADE summary of findings tables as both relative and absolute effects to optimise interpretability. The minimally important difference (MID) was informed by a survey of guideline panel members' views of patient values and preferences, and their subsequent discussion. The thresholds for MID were 1% for recovery with minimal disability, 0.8% for mortality and 1% for sICH; the panel, however, acknowledged both their uncertainty around patient values and likely large variability between patients. We assessed inconsistency among studies by differences in point estimates and overlap of the CI, and the I² statistic. According to Cochrane Review Handbook, an I² of 0%–40% might not be important, 30%–60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50%–90% may represent substantial heterogeneity and 75%–100% indicates considerable heterogeneity.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^94d2ac97]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rationale

Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO). Endovascular treatment (EVT) has been approved as the standard treatment for LVO stroke. Rapid and complete reperfusion is the most important modifiable predictor of good clinical outcome. With the development of endovascular thrombectomy techniques, recanalisation of the occluded vessel can be achieved in 59%–88% of LVO patients. However, only 46%–51% of AIS-LVO patients who attain successful reperfusion after EVT achieve functional independence at 90 days.

Several studies have indicated that clinical outcomes are most favourable in patients achieving successful reperfusion after the first retrieval attempt. Multiple retrieval attempts were reported to be negatively associated with good clinical outcome. First-pass complete reperfusion was shown to be an independent factor for a favourable outcome with 2–3 fold higher odds for favourable clinical outcome. In addition, residual clot burden in the microcirculation or distal circulation after mechanical thrombectomy may also influence the outcome after recanalisation, which may be dissolved by intra-arterial thrombolysis. Previous studies suggest that intra-arterial thrombolysis can increase reperfusion in patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion and improve clinical outcomes. The CHOICE trial indicated that among AIS-LVO patients with successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days.

Tenecteplase (TNK) is a genetic variant of alteplase with higher fibrin specificity, greater conservation of fibrinogen, greater resistance to inhibitors of tissue plasminogen activator, more rapid thrombolysis and longer half-life. In this context, our primary hypothesis is that intra-arterial TNK during EVT may increase the rate of first-pass reperfusion and improve neurological outcome in AIS-LVO patients. The hypothesis was supported by our recent BRETIS-TNK study, which was a prospective, single-arm, single-centre study, indicating that intra-arterial TNK administration as an adjunct to mechanical thrombectomy seemed safe and feasible, with the potential to increase first-pass reperfusion rates (53.8% vs 36.0%) and good clinical outcome (50% vs 34.6%), compared with historical control patients. Based on these pilot results, we designed this trial to determine the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial TNK administration during EVT in AIS-LVO patients.

Interpretation

For patients who had an ischaemic stroke with large vessel occlusion who present to comprehensive stroke centres and are eligible for both immediate thrombolysis and EVT, compared with EVT and intravenous alteplase, low certainty evidence suggests that there is possibly a small decrease in the proportion of patients that achieve functional independence and a small increase in mortality with EVT alone; CI are wide with very serious imprecision. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that there is probably a small decrease in sICH with EVT alone. Considering the small differences with very serious imprecision, this evidence supports only weak recommendations for future clinical care. The accompanying guidelineprovides contextualised guidance based on this body of evidence.

Strengths of our systematic review include a comprehensive search for eligible RCTs in any language, and independent study selection, data abstraction and the risk-of-bias assessment by paired reviewers. We engaged a guideline panel of patients and clinical experts to fully contextualise our assessment of the evidence, and to establish MIDs for all outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence and converted all pooled relative effects to RDs to facilitate interpretation.

### Endovascular stent thrombectomy: the new standard of care for large vessel ischaemic stroke [^0238250f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of initial randomised trials of endovascular treatment for ischaemic stroke, published in 2013, were neutral but limited by the selection criteria used, early-generation devices with modest efficacy, non-consecutive enrollment, and treatment delays.

Recent Developments

In the past year, six positive trials of endovascular thrombectomy for ischaemic stroke have provided level 1 evidence for improved patient outcome compared with standard care. In most patients, thrombectomy was performed in addition to thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase, but benefits were also reported in patients ineligible for alteplase treatment. Despite differences in the details of eligibility requirements, all these trials required proof of major vessel occlusion on non-invasive imaging and most used some imaging technique to exclude patients with a large area of irreversibly injured brain tissue. The results indicate that modern thrombectomy devices achieve faster and more complete reperfusion than do older devices, leading to improved clinical outcomes compared with intravenous alteplase alone. The number needed to treat to achieve one additional patient with independent functional outcome was in the range of 3·2–7·1 and, in most patients, was in addition to the substantial efficacy of intravenous alteplase. No major safety concerns were noted, with low rates of procedural complications and no increase in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. WHERE NEXT? Thrombectomy benefits patients across a range of ages and levels of clinical severity. A planned meta-analysis of individual patient data might clarify effects in under-represented subgroups, such as those with mild initial stroke severity or elderly patients. Imaging-based selection, used in some of the recent trials to exclude patients with large areas of irreversible brain injury, probably contributed to the proportion of patients with favourable outcomes. The challenge is how best to implement imaging in clinical practice to maximise benefit for the entire population and to avoid exclusion of patients with smaller yet clinically important potential to benefit. Although favourable imaging identifies patients who might benefit despite long delays from symptom onset to treatment, the proportion of patients with favourable imaging decreases with time. Health systems therefore need to be reorganised to deliver treatment as quickly as possible to maximise benefits. On the basis of available trial data, intravenous alteplase remains the initial treatment for all eligible patients within 4·5 h of stroke symptom onset. Those patients with major vessel occlusion should, in parallel, proceed to endovascular thrombectomy immediately rather than waiting for an assessment of response to alteplase, because minimising time to reperfusion is the ultimate aim of treatment.

### Revolution in acute ischaemic stroke care: a practical guide to mechanical thrombectomy [^23a88216]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background: the evidence

Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (alteplase) and its limitations

Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV r-tPA) 0.9 mg/kg is licensed for use in the UK up to 4.5 hours post symptom onset. In a meta-analysis of 6756 patients in nine randomised trials comparing alteplase with placebo or open control, treatment within 3 hours resulted in good outcome for 259 (32.9%) of 787 patients who received alteplase compared with 176 (23.1%) of 762 who received control (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.27). Rapid delivery of intravenous thrombolysis after stroke onset is crucial: the number needed to treat for an excellent outcome roughly doubles from 5 (for treatment within 90 min) to 9 (when treatment is given at 3.0–4.5 hours). However, the relative benefit of IV r-tPA appears to be consistent regardless of age or stroke severity. Stroke services burgeoned around intravenous thrombolysis, with development of hyperacute stroke units, pathways and protocols, emergency stroke teams and public awareness campaigns, in order to allow populations to access this effective treatment as quickly as possible.

However, the benefit of IV r-tPA for patients with severe stroke due to large artery occlusion is variable, due largely to failure of early recanalisation (generally less than 30% for carotid, proximal middle cerebral artery or basilar artery occlusion). More importantly, there is a good clinical outcome in only ~25% of patients (at best) with proximal anterior circulation or basilar artery occlusion. Important independent risk factors predicting poor outcome post intravenous thrombolysis are the lengthand locationof the arterial thrombus. This lack of efficacy of the only licensed treatment led to efforts to remove larger arterial clots using intra-arterial techniques, initially using lytic but then mechanical means.

Intra-arterial versus intravenous thrombolysis

The PROACT II trial randomised 180 patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to proven occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and without haemorrhage or major early infarction signs on CT scan to heparin and intra-arterial pro-urokinase or heparin alone; 40% in the intervention arm achieved a good outcome compared with 25% in the control arm. This promising endovascular approach led to the development of mechanical thrombectomy.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis following endovascular recanalization for large vessel occlusion stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b69209a]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Observational data also offer arguments regarding the treatment effects of IAT in the ongoing debate. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the efficacy and safety of EVT with intra-arterial alteplase therapy, and the results showed that intra-arterial alteplase with EVT improved functional outcome, without an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Recently, a substudy from the ANGEL-ACT registry demonstrated no benefit in improving functional outcomes, even after propensity score matching. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to date, which provides currently highest evidence that intra-arterial thrombolysis after endovascular recanalization adds benefits on functional outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke. The superiority of IAT after endovascular recanalization for greater improved functional outcome provides important clinical guidance for neurointerventionists. Given the signal of functional improvement with IAT and no evidence that IAT increases risk of death or sICH, the results of this study suggest that use of IAT after endovascular recanalization should be encouraged. Several ongoing clinical trials, including IAT-TOP (Intra-arterial Thrombolysis After Successful Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Posterior Circulation, NCT05897554), BRETIS-TNK II (Intra-arterial Tenecteplase During First Thrombectomy Attempt for Acute Stroke, NCT05657444), INSIST-IT (Improving Neurological Outcome for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion With Sufficient Recanalization After Thrombectomy by Intraarterial Tenecteplase, NCT05657457), IA-SUCCESS (Intra-Arterial Thrombolysis After SUCCESSful Reperfusion in Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke, NCT06768138), and TNK-FLOW (Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Endovascular Thrombectomy for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke, NCT06781385), will add to crucial evidence on the treatment effects of IAT.

Acute ischemic stroke — other endovascular therapies: Initial treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for carefully selected patients with major ischemic strokes of < 6 hours' duration caused by occlusions of the MCA. However, a clinically beneficial dose of intra-arterial alteplase is not established, alteplase does not have US Food and Drug Administration approval for intra-arterial use, and as a consequence mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is recommended over intra-arterial thrombolysis as first-line therapy. Intra-arterial thrombolysis initiated within 6 hours of stroke onset in carefully selected patients who have contraindications to the use of IV alteplase might be considered, but the consequences are unknown.

Limitations

Based on the retrospective design and the absence of randomization, several sources of potential bias have to be considered. The decision of whether to apply IVT or not was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The present study did not analyze center-specific differences in IVT application, which might constitute a bias with regards to different institutional guidelines. Even in the absence of significant differences between the different cohorts in our analysis, we cannot rule out smaller differences that may have been obscured by the limited sample size. Moreover, without randomization, unknown risk factors for a poor outcome are not accounted for. Furthermore, no follow-up vessel imaging was available to compare the impact of reperfusion in the best medical treatment cohort.

Kaesmacher et al. (2024) individual participant data meta-analysis — in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion, 6 randomized clinical trials (N = 2,313; 1,160 IVT + thrombectomy; 1,153 thrombectomy alone) showed a statistically significant interaction between time from symptom onset to IVT and functional outcome (aOR per 1-h delay 0.84 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.97], P = 0.02). Median time from symptom onset to IVT administration was 2 h 28 min (interquartile range [IQR] 1 h 46 min to 3 h 17 min). After 2 h 20 min the benefit associated with IVT + thrombectomy was not significant, and the point estimate crossed the null association at 3 h 14 min; the primary outcome was disability at 90 d using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Trials were performed at thrombectomy-capable stroke centers; nearly all patients in the IVT + thrombectomy group were treated with alteplase, and results may not be generalizable to those treated with tenecteplase.

### Acute ischaemic stroke: recent advances in reperfusion treatment [^7f2eb120]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent Australian trialinvestigated, whether IVT used between 4.5 and 9 h after stroke onset in patients having hypoperfused but salvageable brain regions detected on perfusion imaging could improve the outcomes compared with placebo. Significantly, more patients (35.4% vs. 29.5%, P = 0.04) in the thrombolysis group had good neurologic outcomes, but this came at the price of higher rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH; 6.2% vs. 0.9%, P = 0.053) and numerically (not significantly) higher all-cause mortality at 3 months (11.5% vs. 8.9%, P = 0.67).

The question of whether the combination of delayed (4.5–9 h after stroke onset) IVT and mechanical thrombectomy may be deleterious (e.g. increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage or clot migration to more distal vessel segments not accessible for thrombectomy) was tested in two small studies with neutral results.

Intra-arterial thrombolysis alone was compared with a placebo in the PROACT-II trial. Intra-arterial thrombolysis achieved better neurologic outcomes, but there was no difference in mortality. Intra-arterial thrombolysis increased the risk of sICH more than five times (11% vs. 2% in the placebo group).

Combining intravenous and intra-arterial alteplase was investigated and frequently used until 2004, when intra-arterial alteplase was quickly replaced by mechanical thrombectomy, which demonstrated more frequent and more complete recanalization of LVO.

Intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful thrombectomy was tested in a small, prematurely terminated trial: The 121 patients treated with thrombectomy within 24 h after stroke onset were randomized to intra-arterial alteplase (maximum dose 22.5 mg) infused over 15–30 min or placebo. Excellent neurologic outcome (mRs of 0 or 1 at 90 days) was 59% with alteplase and 40% with placebo (adjusted risk difference: 18.4%; 95% CI: 0.3%–36.4%; P = 0.047). The 90-day mortality was 8% with alteplase and 15% with placebo (risk difference: −7.2%; 95% CI: −19.2% to 4.8%).

### Is thrombectomy indicated in all ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion? [^bec7996c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Purpose of this topical review is to examine the current randomized and nonrandomized evidence evaluating endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in selected patient populations with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions.

Recent Findings

After establishing EVT as the first-line treatment in patients with large vessel occlusions and limited ischemic changes on neuroimaging, recent trials successfully demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with large core strokes and those with basilar occlusions up to 24h of last known well. Nonrandomized evidence in patients with mild stroke severity, baseline disability, medium and distal vessel occlusions and time from last known well > 24h also suggested potential benefit of EVT in selected patients. Further randomized evidence will help establish EVT efficacy and safety in these populations.

Summary

EVT is established as the de-facto treatment of choice in a significant proportion of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion and has shown potential benefits in additional patient subgroups. A rigorous risk-benefit assessment and discussions with patients and their families in the absence of randomized evidence should help facilitate an informed, individualized decision-making process for this revolutionary treatment in peripheral patient subgroups with limited evidence.

### Effect of thrombolytics on delayed reperfusion after incomplete thrombectomy: target trial emulation [^d8f560c6]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study does not investigate whether thrombolytics should be given before EVT. Therefore, our results currently do not allow for individualized decision making on giving or withholding IVT. Instead, we investigate the effects of circulating thrombolytics on residual occlusions after EVT among patients with incomplete reperfusion who undergo perfusion imaging at the 24-hour follow-up. Patients with remaining circulating thrombolytics at the conclusion of the intervention with distal occlusions had a higher likelihood of spontaneous clearance of these occlusions because of the continued activity of the circulating thrombolytics, especially among patients receiving tenecteplase. Previous studies have demonstrated the reperfusion-favoring effect of thrombolytic before EVT, while other studies have demonstrated this effect of thrombolytics after EVT (CHOICE, NCT03876119; Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular therapy [ANGEL TNK], NCT05624190; Intra-arterial alteplase for acute ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy [PEARL], NCT05856851, presented at the International Stroke Conference, February 5–7 2025, Los Angeles, CA). Bridging this gap (thrombolytics before vs after EVT) are studies showing benefit of complementing and/or continuing with thrombolytics in settings of failed/unsuccessful EVT.

Consistent with previous reports, we also underline potential therapeutic effect of thrombolytics in the treatment of patients with incomplete reperfusion. This effect is presently being investigated by several randomized controlled trials (TECNO, NCT05499832; CHOICE II, NCT05797792; RESCUE-TNK, NCT05657470), and their results will provide further information on potential benefits of thrombolytics in cases of incomplete reperfusion. Although the mode of lytic administration differs between these trials and our study (intra-arterial vs intravenous, respectively), it should not affect the mechanism of thrombolytics on residual occlusions. The reperfusion-favoring effect of IVT is further supported by pathophysiologic reasoning, as thrombolytics are anticipated to attenuate or dissolve thrombi, regardless of the timing of administration. Moreover, we would expect a stronger treatment effect of intra-arterially given lytics because of higher concentration on a local level. If the present results are validated externally, thrombolytics may be administrated more liberally if the chances of incomplete reperfusion are suspected to be high, and concepts such as reverse bridging therapy should be tested.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular recanalisation in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion (ATTENTION-IA): multicentre randomised controlled trial [^32d11673]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Interventions

Both treatment arms received endovascular thrombectomy, using stent retrievers, thromboaspiration, balloon angioplasty, stent deployment, or a combination of these approaches. The treatment modality for each patient was at the discretion of the treating team. Centres and interventionalists were highly experienced. In the ATTENTION (1672/2134) and (BASILAR) (647/829; assessment of endovascular treatment for acute basilar artery occlusion via a nationwide prospective registry) registries in China, about 80% of participants with acute basilar artery occlusion underwent thrombectomy, with a mortality rate of 42% and morbidity rate (modified Rankin scale score 4–6 at 90 days) of 65%. To participate in the ATTENTION-IA trial, the neurointerventionists had to be specially qualified to perform such treatments, including having more than five years' experience in cerebrovascular interventions and a minimum of 80 independently completed thrombectomies.

Patients randomised to the tenecteplase group received an intra-arterial infusion of tenecteplase (0.0625 mg/kg, maximum dose 6.25 mg) through a distal access catheter or microcatheter located proximal to the residual thrombus (if still present) or distal to the origin of the main pontine perforator branches over 15 seconds. The dose was chosen proportional to the intra-arterial alteplase dose used in the CHOICE trial. Patients randomised to the control group received standard care without intra-arterial adjunctive treatment.

Radiological follow-up using CT plus CT angiography, MRI, or magnetic resonance angiography was conducted within 36 hours after randomisation, and at any other time when neurological symptoms worsened. Local trained investigators assessed outcomes on the modified Rankin scale, EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 level, and Barthel index at 90 days based on a standardised telephone interview.

### Cost-effectiveness of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful thrombectomy [^d3b09b21]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The use of IA alteplase after IV-tPA and successful EVT is cost-effective in Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK and the USA based on the results of the CHOICE trial. The higher costs associated with additional IA alteplase are well below the willingness to pay in each respective country and offset by the improved outcomes in patients who receive additional IA alteplase.

These findings align with cost-effectiveness studies in stroke, which have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of EVT in various patient populations. Notably, these analyses differ in that EVT has a greater effect on higher mRS scores than adjunctive IA lysis, as investigated in the CHOICE trial. Additional IA alteplase in the CHOICE trial predominantly affected lower mRS scores, making the treatment relatively unique compared with previously published trials on LVO. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that the treatment is cost-effective despite its limited impact on long-term nursing cost. We utilized standardized country-specific models rather than microcosting per individual patient. Although this approach could potentially yield different results due to the differences in costs considered in each country-specific study, a model-based approach offers the advantage of being more generalizable in a broader clinical context than using detailed data from a single hospital or rehabilitation setting. After a detailed analysis of each country-specific study, the authors considered that the cost data could be compared in this context and used in a single model. It is important to note that the mid-term and long-term costs for mRS 0–1 used in the model for Germany are zero, as indicated in the Muntendorf et al 'sstudy. This fact should be borne in mind when analyzing the results for Germany. It has a positive influence on the final result of the study for this country and we can agree that results closer to those ofEuropean neighbors would have been found if costs had been associated with these mRS levels.

### Natural evolution of incomplete reperfusion in patients following endovascular therapy after ischemic stroke [^670ea196]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

The CHOICE trial (The Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy; NCT03876119) investigated the effect of IAT administered after EVT and demonstrated a beneficial effect of IAT on clinical outcomes among patients with successful reperfusion (eTICI > 2b50). ALLY pilot study (Adjunctive Intra‐Arterial Tenecteplase Following Mechanical Thrombectomy; NCT05172934) showed that IAT was safe among patients who achieved eTICI 2b to 2c at the end of an intervention (Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology Meeting, Miami, November 2023). Consistent with these findings, prior meta-analysis revealed a favorable effect of adjunctive IAT on early reperfusion and clinical outcomes. However, the recently presented ATTENTION-IA trial (Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Endovascular Therapy in Patients With Acute Posterior Circulation Arterial Occlusion; NCT05684172) did not show a clinical benefit of administrating IAT after successful reperfusion (eTICI > 2b50) in patients with posterior circulation strokes (European Stroke Organization Conference, Basel, May 2024). Several studies are currently investigating the effect of IAT to improve reperfusion following EVT, as some medium or distal vessel thrombi may not be accessible by mechanical maneuvers. INSIST-TNK (Improving Neuroprotective Strategy for Ischemic Stroke With Poor Recanalization After Thrombectomy by Intra-Arterial TNK; NCT04201964) is investigating the reperfusion effect of additional IAT among patients with anterior circulation stroke who achieve eTICI 1 to 2a, while RESCUE-TNK (Rescue Thrombolysis for Medium Vessel Occlusion; NCT05657470) is investigating this effect among patients with primary medium-vessel occlusions that cannot be amended with EVT. TECNO trial (Safety and Efficacy of Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase for Non-Complete Reperfusion of Intracranial Occlusions; NCT05499832) has 2 imaging end points and will be able to provide data on the safety and efficacy of IAT on both early (25 minutes) and DR (24 hours) residual vessel occlusions.

### Adjunctive intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion: meta-analysis of outcomes, dosage, and patient selection [^67581ef9]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite high recanalization rates with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large vessel occlusions, functional outcomes remain suboptimal. This study investigates whether adjunctive intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis following successful EVT can improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for functional and safety outcomes.

Results

Seven trials (2131 patients) were included. IA thrombolysis was administered to 1081 (50.7%) patients. Patients receiving adjunctive IA thrombolysis had higher odds of excellent functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–1) at 90 days (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.21 to 1.72) compared with the EVT-alone group while maintaining similar rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH; OR 1.15, 95%CI 0.75 to 1.75). Subgroup analysis of excellent functional outcomes showed that the benefits of IA thrombolysis were primarily observed in specific patient populations: those treated with alteplase 0.225mg/kg or tenecteplase 0.125mg/kg, patients with lower expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scores, higher initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and those with cardioembolic etiology. Mortality rates and good functional outcomes (mRS 0–2) remained comparable between treatment groups.

Conclusion

Adjunctive IA thrombolysis following successful EVT may improve functional outcomes without added risk of sICH. Certain patient subgroups (those with lower recanalization rates, higher NIHSS, and cardioembolic etiology) and specific thrombolytic agents and dosages (alteplase 0.225mg/kg, tenecteplase 0.125mg/kg) appear to derive greater benefits from this approach. Further research is needed to validate these findings and refine patient selection.

### Adjunct thrombolysis enhances brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy [^3d0631dd]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The CHOICE trial recently showed that adjunct intra‐arterial alteplase added at the end of a successful thrombectomy significantly increased the rate of patients free of disability at 90 days (mRS = 0–1) compared with placebo. Remarkably, the treatment effect occurred despite both treatment groups having similar angiographic results post‐thrombectomy, suggesting that the outcome improved from more effective thrombolytic activity within the more distal cerebral circulation, not impeded by proximal occlusions that had previously been removed successfully by thrombectomy. The current nested study extends the understanding of these clinical findings by providing supportive imaging evidence of improved brain reperfusion with the use of adjunct intra‐arterial alteplase. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of hypoperfusion at follow‐up from 58% to 24% in the alteplase group compared to the placebo group, and the effect was also significant in patients treated with intravenous alteplase before thrombectomy. In patients with successful reperfusion but incomplete normalization of the angiography (eTICI = 2b50/67/2c), it is likely that part of the thrombolytic action of adjunct alteplase took place in distal emboli clogging the macrovasculature. However, in patients with complete normalization of the angiography (eTICI = 3), there was also a reduction in the prevalence of hypoperfusion from 43% to 14% in the alteplase group compared to the placebo group, highlighting a high prevalence of no‐reflow, and the efficacy of adjunct intra‐arterial alteplase to palliate the phenomenon. Although some previous studies described a high prevalence of hypoperfusion at the completion of successful thrombectomy, the current results prolonged the duration of hypoperfusion for at least 48 hours, ruling out that it represents a fleeting phenomenon.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular reperfusion for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the POST-TNK randomized clinical trial [^b07c8601]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The impact of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase administration following near-complete to complete reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke is unknown.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion (defined as a score on the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] scale of 2c to 3) after EVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, blinded outcome assessment trial implemented at 34 hospitals in China among 540 patients with stroke due to proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion within 24 hours of the time they were last known to be well, with an eTICI score of 2c to 3 after EVT, and without prior intravenous thrombolysis. Recruitment took place between October 26, 2022, and March 1, 2024, with final follow-up on June 3, 2024.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase (n = 269) at 0.0625 mg/kg or no intra-arterial thrombolysis (control group; n = 271).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was freedom from disability, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. The primary safety outcomes were death at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours.

Results

A total of 539 participants (99.8%) completed the trial (median age, 69 years; 221 female [40.9%]). The proportion with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 49.1% (132/269) in the intra-arterial tenecteplase group and 44.1% (119/270) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.97–1.36]; P = 0.11). Ninety-day mortality was 16.0% and 19.3% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.50–1.13]; P = 0.16), respectively. The proportions of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 6.3% and 4.4% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.68–2.99]; P = 0.35), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well and who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after EVT, adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase did not significantly increase the likelihood of freedom from disability at 90 days.

### Thrombolysis after thrombectomy? Revisiting intra-arterial therapy in the EVT era [^5096123f]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the heterogeneity in study populations and treatment protocols, routine implementation of IAT after EVT cannot yet be recommended. Importantly, ongoing randomized trials, such as TECNO (NCT05499832), CHOICE‐2 (NCT05797792), and IA‐SUCCESS (NCT06768138), are expected to refine our understanding of the potential role of adjunctive IAT and how best to implement it. Until their results become available, clinical practice should prioritize enrollment in these studies rather than routine off‐label use of adjunctive IAT, as clinical equipoise remains and supports continued investigation.

While EVT has transformed stroke care, it has not rendered thrombolysis obsolete. This analysis offers a timely contribution to the ongoing discussion about whether adjunctive IAT can improve outcomes beyond what is achieved after mechanical thrombectomy alone. As we continue to refine our tools and deepen our understanding of cerebral reperfusion, a thoughtful reassessment of old strategies within the framework of modern stroke workflows is both appropriate and necessary. Defining the optimal combination and sequence of reperfusion strategies will be key to maximizing recovery for patients with ischemic stroke due to LVO.

### Intravenous tirofiban versus alteplase before endovascular treatment in acute ischemic stroke: a pooled analysis of the DEVT and RESCUE BT trials [^101a6321]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous tirofiban versus alteplase before endovascular treatment (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis using data from 2 multicenter, randomized trials: the DEVT trial (Direct Endovascular Treatment for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke) from May 2018 to May 2020 and the RESCUE BT trial (Intravenous Tirofiban Before Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke) from October 2018 to October 2021. Patients with acute intracranial large vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours from last known well were dichotomized into 2 groups: tirofiban plus EVT versus alteplase bridging with EVT. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2) at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 3-month mortality. Multivariable logistic regression (adjusting for baseline systolic blood pressure, occlusion site, onset-to-puncture time, anesthesia, and first choice of EVT) and propensity score overlap weighting (balance in demographic covariates, stroke characteristics, and initial management between groups) were performed.

Results

One-hundred and eighteen alteplase-treated patients in the DEVT trial and 98 tirofiban-treated patients in the RESCUE BT trial were included (median age, 70 years; 115 [53.2%] men). The rate of functional independence was 60.2% in the tirofiban group compared with 46.6% in the alteplase group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.60–2.63]). Compared with alteplase, tirofiban was not associated with increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (6.8% versus 9.2%; P = 0.51) and mortality (17.8% versus 19.4%; P = 0.76). The propensity score overlap weighting analyses showed consistent outcomes.

Conclusions

Among patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours of onset, tirofiban plus EVT was comparable to alteplase bridging with EVT regarding the efficacy and safety outcomes. These findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require confirmation in a randomized trial.

### Neurothrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke: a prospective single-centre study and comparison with randomized controlled trials [^c31a1e0d]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In the last few months five multicentre, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) unequivocally showed the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion acute ischaemic stroke compared to systemic thrombolysis. Despite varying inclusion criteria and time intervals from onset to revascularization overall increases of good functional outcome between 55% and 81% were reported. However, only a minority of screened patients (approximately 1%) were eligible for intra-arterial (IA) therapy.

Methods

An investigator-initiated, single-centre, prospective and blinded end-point analysis was performed of 3123 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke presenting between February 2010 and December 2014.

Results

One hundred and fifty-four patients [4.9%, age (years) mean (SD), median (interquartile range) 71.2 (± 14), 74.7 (65.9–81.4)] met the inclusion criteria of sparse early ischaemic signs on initial standard cranial computed tomography (CT) (ASPECT score ≥ 7), large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation on CT angiography and start of treatment within 6 h of onset of symptoms. After consensual interdisciplinary treatment decisions 130 patients (4.2%) received IA treatment - in the majority stent-assisted thrombectomy in combination with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator - and 24 patients (0.7%) standard IV thrombolysis. On 3 months' follow-up an overall significant improvement of disability (P = 0.05) as measured by the modified Rankin Scale was shown in favour of the IA treatment group. Good functional outcome was achieved in about twice as many patients (IA vs. IV, 41.2% vs. 21.2%; P = 0.078).

Conclusion

By choosing pragmatic inclusion criteria state-of-the-art IA therapy of a specialized tertiary stroke centre can be safely applied under real-world conditions to a higher percentage of patients with similar success to the recently published RCTs.

### Endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke: the pragmatic ischaemic stroke thrombectomy evaluation (PISTE) randomised, controlled trial [^85f662a7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Pragmatic Ischaemic Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial was a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone with IVT and adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients who had acute ischaemic stroke with large artery occlusive anterior circulation stroke confirmed on CT angiography (CTA).

Design

Eligible patients had IVT started within 4.5hours of stroke symptom onset. Those randomised to additional MT underwent thrombectomy using any Conformité Européene (CE)-marked device, with target interval times for IVT start to arterial puncture of < 90min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving independence defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2 at day 90.

Results

Ten UK centres enrolled 65 patients between April 2013 and April 2015. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (IQR 13–21). Median stroke onset to IVT start was 120min. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in disability-free survival at day 90 with MT (absolute difference 11%, adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p = 0.20). Secondary analyses showed significantly greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0–1) at day 90 (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p = 0.010). In the per-protocol population (n = 58), the primary and most secondary clinical outcomes significantly favoured MT (absolute difference in mRS 0–2 of 22% and adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p = 0.021).

Conclusions

The trial did not find a significant difference between treatment groups for the primary end point. However, the effect size was consistent with published data and across primary and secondary end points. Proceeding as fast as possible to MT after CTA confirmation of large artery occlusion on a background of intravenous alteplase is safe, improves excellent clinical outcomes and, in the per-protocol population, improves disability-free survival.

### Intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke? The SYNTHESIS pilot trial [^e03738a3]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) compared with standard intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Eligible patients with ischemic stroke, who were devoid of contraindications, started IVT within 3 h or IAT as soon as possible within 6 h. Patients were randomized within 3 h of onset to receive either intravenous alteplase, in accordance with the current European labeling, or up to 0.9 mg/kg intra-arterial alteplase (maximum 90 mg), over 60 min into the thrombus, if necessary with mechanical clot disruption and/or retrieval. The purpose of the study was to determine the proportion of favorable outcome at 90 days. Safety endpoints included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), death and other serious adverse events. RESULTS 54 patients (25 IAT) were enrolled. Median time from stroke onset to start to treatment was 3 h 15 min for IAT and 2 h 35 min for IVT (p < 0.001). Almost twice as many patients on IAT as those on IVT survived without residual disability (12/25 vs 8/29; OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.9 to 11.4; p = 0.067). SICH occurred in 2/25 patients on IAT and in 4/29 on IVT (OR 0.5; CI 0.1 to 3.3; p = 0.675). Mortality at day 7 was 5/25 (IAT) compared with 4/29 (IVT) (OR 1.6; CI 0.4 to 6.7; p = 0.718). There was no significant difference in the rate of other serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Rapid initiation of IAT is a safe and feasible alternative to IVT in acute ischemic stroke.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^5b837f27]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been recommended as the optimal treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). A meta-analysisof individual patient data from 5 randomized clinical trials indicated that 75% of patients achieved successful reperfusion. However, only 27% were free of disability at 90 days among these patients. The discrepancy between successful reperfusion and clinical outcomes is at least in part attributable to irreversible damage that occurs in brain tissue before reperfusion. But additionally, even after successful reperfusion of the large vessels, patients with Extended Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) score 2b and eTICI 2c have residual occlusions in medium vessels that continue to produce ischemia. In addition, even patients with eTICI 3 outcomes can have partial or complete failure of reperfusion in the microcirculation, known as the no-reflow phenomenon (NRP), which may also significantly contribute to this discordance. In situ thrombosis in the microcirculatory and distal embolization from the proximal cerebral arteries are important contributors for the NRP according to the experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. As the efficacy of thrombolysis is related to the target thrombus size, theoretically, these smaller thrombi would be more suitable for pharmacologic dissolution than larger proximal thrombi.

### Alteplase for acute ischemic stroke at 4.5 to 24 hours-JAMA network… [^0abab331]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does intravenous alteplase administered 4. 5 to 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset improve outcomes in patients with salvageable brain tissue and no initial plan for thrombectomy. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 372 patients, 40% receiving alteplase achieved functional independence at 90 days vs 26% with standard care, a statistically significant difference. Meaning In patients with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, alteplase given 4. 5 to 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset may improve functional outcomes. Importance The safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolytics beyond 4. 5 hours after ischemic stroke onset remain inadequately studied. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4. 5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion.

Design, Setting, and Participants. Eligibility criteria included stroke onset of 4. 5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase or standard medical treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days.

### Mechanical thrombectomy after intravenous alteplase versus alteplase alone after stroke (THRACE): a randomised controlled trial [^44012fe3]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase alone cannot reperfuse most large-artery strokes. We aimed to determine whether mechanical thrombectomy in addition to intravenous thrombolysis improves clinical outcome in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

THRACE is a randomised controlled trial done in 26 centres in France. Patients aged 18–80 years with acute ischaemic stroke and proximal cerebral artery occlusion were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous thrombolysis alone (IVT group) or intravenous thrombolysis plus mechanical thrombectomy (IVTMT group). Intravenous thrombolysis (alteplase 0·9 mg/kg [maximum 90 mg], with an initial bolus of 10% of the total dose followed by infusion of the remaining dose over 60 min) had to be started within 4 h and thrombectomy within 5 h of symptom onset. Occlusions had to be confirmed by CT or magnetic resonance angiography. Randomisation was done centrally with a computer-generated sequential minimisation method and was stratified by centre. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving functional independence at 3 months, defined by a score of 0–2 on the modified Rankin scale, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, patients lost to follow-up and those with missing data were excluded). Safety outcomes were analysed in the per-protocol population (ie, all patients who did not follow the protocol of their randomisation group precisely were excluded from the analysis). THRACE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01062698.

Findings

Between June 1, 2010, and Feb 22, 2015, 414 patients were randomly assigned to the IVT group (n = 208) or the IVTMT group (n = 204). Four patients (two in each group) lost to follow-up and six (four in the IVT group and two in the IVTMT group) with missing data were excluded. 85 (42%) of 202 patients in the IVT group and 106 (53%) of 200 patients in the IVTMT group achieved functional independence at 3 months (odds ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·05–2·30; p = 0·028). The two groups had no significant differences in mortality at 3 months (24 [12%] deaths of 202 patients vs 27 [13%] of 206; p = 0·70) or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at 24 h (four [2%] of 185 vs three [2%] of 192; p = 0·71). Common adverse events related to thrombectomy were vasospasm (33 [23%] patients) and embolisation in a new territory (nine [6%]).

Interpretation

Mechanical thrombectomy combined with standard intravenous thrombolysis improves functional independence in patients with acute cerebral ischaemia, with no evidence of increased mortality. Bridging therapy should be considered for patients with large-vessel occlusions of the anterior circulation.

### Adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke (POST-TNK): study rationale and design [^edaa7cca]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adjunct intra-arterial alteplase has been shown to potentially improve clinical outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke who have undergone successful endovascular thrombectomy. Tenecteplase, known for its enhanced fibrin specificity and extended activity duration, could potentially enhance outcomes in stroke patients after successful reperfusion when used as an adjunct intra-arterial therapy.

Aim

To explore the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO stroke.

Sample Size

To randomize 498 participants 1:1 to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase or no intra-arterial adjunctive thrombolysis therapy.

Methods and Design

An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, blind-endpoint multicenter clinical trial. Eligible patients with anterior circulation LVO stroke presenting within 24h from symptom onset (time last known well) and excellent to complete reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale 2c-3) at endovascular thrombectomy are planned to be randomized.

Outcomes

The primary outcome is freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS, of 0–1) at 90days. The primary safety outcomes are mortality through 90days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48h.

Discussion

The POST-TNK trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with LVO stroke and excellent to complete reperfusion.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^7fa25c60]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

These phase 1 and 2 randomized clinical trials found that administering tenecteplase at doses of 0.0313 mg/kg or 0.0625 mg/kg after successful EVT within 24 hours of onset in patients with anterior circulation LVO acute ischemic stroke is adequately safe to advance to larger trials. However, due to the study's limitations, particularly in size and scope, the efficacy of these doses could not be conclusively established. Therefore, further validation through a larger phase 2b or phase 3 studies is necessary to assess the potential therapeutic benefits and to refine the optimal dosing strategy for improving clinical outcomes in this patient population.

### Adjunctive intra-arterial thrombolysis following successful endovascular reperfusion in acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials [^84cc006e]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of adjunctive intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) after successful endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) remain uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAT in this setting.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to February 2025, and reviewed abstracts from the 2025 International Stroke Conference, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IAT versus placebo or best medical management in AIS-LVO patients who achieved successful reperfusion after EVT. Outcome measures included 90-day excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0–1) and good (mRS 0–2) functional outcomes, 90-day reduced disability (≥ 1-point mRS improvement), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), any ICH, and 90-day mortality. A random-effects model was employed for the meta-analysis.

Results

Seven RCTs with 2131 patients (1083 assigned to IAT, and 1048 to control) were included. Compared to controls, IAT was associated with significantly higher likelihood of 90-day excellent functional outcomes (risk ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.36; I² = 0%) and reduced disability (common odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.03–1.40; I² = 0%), but not with 90-day good functional outcomes. Risks of any ICH, sICH, and mortality were similar between groups. Subgroup analyses suggested numerically higher odds of excellent functional outcomes among patients with anterior circulation LVO or those receiving IA alteplase/tenecteplase.

Conclusion

Adjunctive IAT following successful EVT in AIS-LVO patients led to improved 90-day excellent functional outcomes and reduced disability without increasing sICH or mortality risks.

### Effect of IV thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with vessel occlusion in the WAKE-UP trial [^043db999]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

IV alteplase is the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke independent of etiology, localization, or vessel status within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. However, there is an ongoing discussion whether IV thrombolysis (IV tPA) is also sufficiently effective in patients with thrombi leading to occlusion of large intracranial arteries. The multicenter randomized clinical trial (DIRECT-MT)published in 2020 found that endovascular thrombectomy alone was noninferior (regarding functional outcomes) to endovascular thrombectomy preceded by IV alteplase. However, a meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials published in September of 2023 in Lancet was unable to replicate this result. Data from randomized trials on the treatment effect of only thrombolysis (not as bridging IV tPA) in patients with vessel occlusion are still lacking.

When the WAKE-UP trial started in September 2012, there was yet no evidence for the benefit of MT for acute stroke available from randomized controlled trials, and in most of the stroke centers across Europe, endovascular stroke treatment was not the standard of care. Planned endovascular stroke treatment was an exclusion criterion for WAKE-UP; therefore, in this predefined subgroup analysis, we are able to test the hypothesis that MRI-guided IV thrombolysis with alteplase in unknown-onset ischemic stroke would be safe and efficient in patients presenting with vessel occlusion on MR angiography (MRA).

### Effect of occlusion site on the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase before endovascular thrombectomy: a prespecified subgroup analysis of DIRECT-MT [^14296604]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recent trials showed thrombectomy alone was comparable to bridging therapy in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion eligible for both intravenous alteplase and endovascular thrombectomy. We performed this study to examine whether occlusion site modifies the effect of intravenous alteplase before thrombectomy.

Methods

This is a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized trial evaluating risk and benefit of intravenous alteplase before thrombectomy (DIRECT-MT [Direct Intra-Arterial Thrombectomy in Order to Revascularize AIS Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals]). Among 658 randomized patients, 640 with baseline occlusion site information were included. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis with an interaction term was used to estimate treatment effect modification by occlusion location (internal carotid artery versus M1 versus M2). We report the adjusted common odds ratio for a shift toward better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale after thrombectomy alone compared with combination treatment adjusted for age, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, the time from stroke onset to randomization, the modified Rankin Scale score before stroke onset, and collateral score per the DIRECT-MT statistical analysis plan.

Results

The overall adjusted common odds ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.82–1.43) with thrombectomy alone compared with combination treatment, and there was no significant treatment-by-occlusion site interaction (P = 0.47). In subgroups based on occlusion location, we found the following adjusted common odds ratios: 0.99 (95% CI, 0.62–1.59) for internal carotid artery occlusions, 1.12 (95% CI, 0.77–1.64) for M1 occlusions, and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.53–2.79) for M2 occlusions. No treatment-by-occlusion site interactions were observed for dichotomized modified Rankin Scale distributions and successful reperfusion (extended thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥ 2b) before thrombectomy. Differences in symptomatic hemorrhage rate were not significant between occlusion locations (internal carotid artery occlusion: 7.02% in bridging therapy versus 7.14% for thrombectomy alone, P = 0.97; M1 occlusion: 5.06% versus 2.48%, P = 0.22; M2 occlusion: 9.09% versus 4.76%; P = 0.78).

Conclusions

In this prespecified subgroup of a randomized trial, we found no evidence that occlusion location can inform intravenous alteplase decisions in endovascular treatment eligible patients directly presenting at endovascular treatment capable centers. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03469206.

### Cost-effectiveness of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful thrombectomy [^b9686211]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2025). High credibility.

Results

Over 20 years, treating with adjunctive IA lysis compared with placebo in patients with LVO acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy implies a cost-saving of US$2725 in Germany and incremental cost in every other country studied, from US$1832 in Italy to US$10 120 in the USA.

This money improves QALYs gained across all the countries and scenarios examined. This improvement is evidenced by an incremental QALY gained at lifetime ranging from 1.05 in the USA to 1.29 in France. Our investigation reveals an incremental cost per QALY ranging from US$−2350 in Germany to US$9628 in the USA. These outcomes are presented in table 1.

Table 1
Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis

In the base case, which encompasses a healthcare perspective and incorporates the GDP threshold specific to each country, adjunctive IA lysis was determined to be cost-effective in Spain, France, the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom and the USA, and to be a dominant strategy in Germany when compared with adjunct placebo among patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by LVO and treated with thrombectomy.

Sensitivity analyses

Deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results. This analysis was based on the CHOICE trial scenario and inputs were varied by ± 20%. Deterministic sensitivity revealed that the model was most sensitive to variation in mean age, acute care costs mRS 0–2 and poststroke utility with mRS0 (online supplemental figure S1).

PSAs for the seven countries

The results are shown as scatterplots of incremental costs and incremental QALYs gained of using IA alteplase after Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator (IV-tPA) and EVT (figure 1). Each dot represents one simulation run. We conducted 10 000 simulations for each country analysis to maximize the reliability of the results. The PSA demonstrated that IA after IV-tPA with EVT has more than 90% probability of being cost-effective at a WTP of US$45 000/QALY in the seven countries included in the study.

We then studied the acceptability in each country related to the probability of being cost-effective and found a 90% probability of being cost-effective for Germany and Italy at a WTP of US$10 000/QALY, France at a WTP of US$15 000/QALY, the Netherlands and the UK at a WTP of US$30 000/QALY and Spain at a WTP of US$35 000/QALY and the USA at a WTP of US$45 000/QALY (figure 2).

### The added benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization by endovascular treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials [^e69c7023]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several ongoing RCTs are expected to further clarify the utility of IAT in stroke care, such as the Intra‐Arterial Thrombolysis After SUCCESSful Reperfusion in Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke (IA‐SUCCESS; NCT06768138), the Intra‐arterial Thrombolysis After Successful Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Posterior Circulation (IAT‐TOP; NCT05897554), and the CHemical OptImization of Cerebral Embolectomy 2 (CHOICE 2; NCT05797792) trials. As these data mature, they may help refine the role of adjunct thrombolysis, particularly in underexplored populations such as patients with occlusions of the posterior circulation and those with incomplete reperfusion or microvascular deficits on perfusion imaging, where randomized evidence remains scarce. Upcoming secondary analyses from included trials may also inform critical procedural variables including thrombolytic selection, dosing strategies, and timing of administration.

In parallel, there is growing interest in expanding the use of IAT to patients without successful recanalization — an area that remains investigational but conceptually compelling given the pathophysiological relevance of distal emboli and microvascular no‐reflow. Recently, a single‐arm pilot trial has shown that adjunctive intra‐arterial tenecteplase in AIS patients with incomplete reperfusion (modified TICI 2b‐2c) post‐EVT was feasible and was not associated with increased rates of intracranial hemorrhage. Several RCTs in this setting, including the Safety and Efficacy of Intra‐arterial Tenecteplase for Noncomplete Reperfusion of Intracranial Occlusions (TECNO; NCT05499832), the Improving Neuroprotective Strategy for Ischemic Stroke With Poor Recanalization After Thrombectomy by Intra‐arterial TNK (INSIST‐TNK; NCT04201964), and the Intra‐arterial Tenecteplase During First Thrombectomy Attempt for Acute Stroke (BRETIS‐TNK II; NCT05657444) trials are ongoing or with results awaited.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^b5f55d9b]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Improved angiographic reperfusion was noted in 6.5% of patients receiving intra-arterial tenecteplase, 0.0625 mg/kg, and 8.7% of patients receiving intra-arterial tenecteplase, 0.0313 mg/kg. There were no significant differences in other prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes among groups. The results in the prespecified pooled analysis yielded similar results. The full distribution of outcomes across all 7 mRS levels is shown in Figure 2 B. No patients had major protocol violations; therefore, the planned per-protocol sensitivity analysis was not needed.

### Treating acute large vessel occlusion stroke: to bridge or not to bridge? [^6577776b]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hot debates exist regarding whether patients who had an acute large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS) can skip tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and go directly to thrombectomy in comprehensive stroke centres. Three head-to-head randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of direct endovascular treatment (dEVT) versus bridge therapy (BT) with intravenous alteplase have been recently completed in the Asian population. The DIRECT-MT (Direct Intraarterial Thrombectomy in Order to Revascularize Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals: a Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial) Study randomly enrolled 656 patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke with anterior circulation LVOS across 41 large teaching hospitals in China to receive BT or dEVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The study showed that the dEVT group was non-inferior to BT in terms of 90-day clinical outcomes (median 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 3 vs 3; OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.40; p = 0.04). Likewise, the recently published DEVT (Direct Endovascular Thrombectomy vs Combined IVT and Endovascular Thrombectomy for Patients With Acute Large Vessel Occlusion in the Anterior Circulation) trial involving 234 Chinese patients who had an anterior circulation LVOS found that the rate of functional independence (90-day mRS ≥ 2) in dEVT group was numerically higher than that in the BT group (54.3% vs 46.6%, difference: 7.7%, 1-sided 97.5% CI: −5.1% to ∞; p = 0.003 for non-inferiority). With prespecified non-inferiority threshold of 10% for the favourable outcome proportion difference, the trial concluded that dEVT was non-inferior to BT. Simultaneously published with DEVT, the SKIP (Direct Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute LVO Stroke) trial included 204 patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery M1 occlusions presenting within 4.5 hours of stroke onset across 23 sites in Japan. Favourable outcome occurred in 60 patients (59.4%) in the dEVT group and 59 patients (57.3%) in the BT group, with no significant between-group difference (difference, 2.1% (1-sided 97.5% CI −11.4% to ∞); OR 1.09 (1-sided 97.5% CI 0.63 to ∞); p = 0.18 for non-inferiority). Noted that the trial used a reduced dose of alteplase (0.6 mg/kg), which did not show the non-inferiority to standard dose of alteplase (0.9 mg/kg).

### Adjunct thrombolysis enhances brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy [^2441ebd2]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Successful reperfusion is defined on digital subtraction angiography using different metrics as the antegrade restoration of capillary blush of at least 50% of the downstream territory. A better outcome is associated with a higher reperfusion score, but not infrequently full angiographic reperfusion may be associated with poor outcomes, and it is considered futile. In observational studies, multiple factors were associated with futile recanalization, such as old age, brain atrophy, leukoaraiosis, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, female sex, absence of collaterals, large infarct core, hypertension, hyperglycemia, delayed treatment, and number of thrombectomy passes.

We argue that no‐reflow may be a major contributor to suboptimal clinical efficacy of thrombectomy despite successful reperfusion on angiography. Strong evidence in support of this proposition was obtained recently in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized study of patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy and allocated to receive adjunct intra‐arterial alteplase or placebo if the procedure had been successful (Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy (CHOICE) trial, NCT03876119). The rationale to defer the administration of intra‐arterial alteplase to the end of thrombectomy was to facilitate the lysis of distal microthrombi, which might still be formed in the microcirculation and not be detected on digital subtraction angiography. In that study, although both treatment groups had similar angiographic results post‐thrombectomy, the primary outcome (proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at day 90) was 59% in the alteplase group and 40% in the placebo group, and this difference was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the infarct expansion ratio between the two treatment groups in the study, although a majority of the patients only had a noncontrast brain CT (NCCT) scan at baseline and at follow‐up to delineate the course of the infarction. Foreseeing the limitations of NCCT, at one study site it was planned also to perform perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI), diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy at 48 hours after therapy whenever possible. Herein, we report the results of this preplanned advanced brain imaging study.

### Aspiration thrombectomy after intravenous alteplase versus intravenous alteplase alone [^f824b8c1]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Thrombectomy, primarily with stent retrievers with or without adjunctive aspiration, provided clinical benefit across multiple prospective randomized trials. Whether this benefit is exclusive to stent retrievers is unclear.

Methods

THERAPY (The Randomized, Concurrent Controlled Trial to Assess the Penumbra System's Safety and Effectiveness in the Treatment of Acute Stroke; NCT01429350) was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1), open label, blinded end point evaluation, concurrent controlled clinical trial of aspiration thrombectomy after intravenous alteplase (IAT) administration compared with intravenous-alteplase alone in patients with large vessel ischemic stroke because of a thrombus length of ≥ 8 mm. The primary efficacy end point was the percent of patients achieving independence at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2; intention-to-treat analysis). The primary safety end point was the rate of severe adverse events (SAEs) by 90 days (as treated analysis). Patients were randomized 1:1 across 36 centers in 2 countries (United States and Germany).

Results

Enrollment was halted after 108 (55 IAT and 53 intravenous) patients (of 692 planned) because of external evidence of the added benefit of endovascular therapy to intravenous-alteplase alone. Functional independence was achieved in 38% IAT and 30% intravenous intention-to-treat groups (P = 0.52). Intention-to-treat ordinal modified Rankin Scale odds ratio was 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.86–3.59; P = 0.12) in favor of IAT. Secondary efficacy analyses all demonstrated a consistent direction of effect toward benefit of IAT. No differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates (9.3% IAT versus 9.7% intravenous, P = 1.0) or 90-day mortality (IAT: 12% versus intravenous: 23.9%, P = 0.18) were observed.

Conclusions

THERAPY did not achieve its primary end point in this underpowered sample. Directions of effect for all prespecified outcomes were both internally and externally consistent toward benefit. It is possible that an alternate method of thrombectomy, primary aspiration, will benefit selected patients harboring large vessel occlusions. Further study on this topic is indicated.

### The end of tissue-type plasminogen activator's reign? [^5b3f74ab]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanical thrombectomy is a highly effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke caused by large-vessel occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation, significantly increasing the likelihood of recovery to functional independence. Until recently, whether intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy provided additional benefits to patients with acute ischemic stroke-large-vessel occlusion remained unclear. Given that reperfusion is a key factor for clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke-large-vessel occlusion and the efficacy of both intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is time-dependent, achieving complete reperfusion with a single pass should be the primary angiographic goal. However, it remains undetermined whether extending the procedure with additional endovascular attempts or local lytics administration safely leads to higher reperfusion grades and whether there are significant public health and cost implications. Here, we outline the current state of knowledge and research avenues that remain to be explored regarding the consistent therapeutic benefit of intravenous thrombolysis in anterior circulation strokes and the potential place of adjunctive intra-arterial lytics administration, including alternative thrombolytic agent place.

### Acute ischaemic stroke: recent advances in reperfusion treatment [^345bf11f]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

There are very few data about the use of intra-arterial thrombolysis after failed thrombectomy — the authors of this manuscript are rather sceptical in this respect and are not using thrombolysis in situations when thrombectomy failed to achieve successful reperfusion — with one possible exception: when the thrombotic occlusion site is too distal and not safely accessible with a stent retriever. One additional area of exploration is combined intra-arterial thrombolysis and thrombectomy when a residual distal clot is present after LVO is removed and there is a TICI 2a or less result on the final angiogram.

The DIRECT-MT trial compared intravenous alteplase before endovascular treatment (EVT) vs. EVT alone in 656 patients. Intravenous alteplase was more frequently (19% vs. 10%) associated with early reperfusion. The effect was modified by time from randomization to groin puncture: thrombolysis was superior only when this time delay exceeded 33 min. Thus, intravenous alteplase should be considered before thrombectomy if a groin puncture delay of more than 30 min is anticipated by the treating medical team.

The MR CLEAN-NO IV trial enrolled 539 stroke patients eligible for thrombolysis and thrombectomy who presented to a thrombectomy-capable hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to receive direct thrombectomy or IVT followed by thrombectomy. The primary endpoint (good functional outcome defined as mRs 0–2 at 90 days) was present in 49% (direct thrombectomy) and 51% (thrombolysis + thrombectomy). Mortality was 20.5% with thrombectomy alone and 15.8% with thrombolysis plus thrombectomy (adjusted OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 0.84–2.30). Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage occurred in 5.9% and 5.3% of the patients in the respective groups (adjusted OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.60–2.81). The authors concluded that direct thrombectomy was neither superior nor non-inferior to IVT followed by thrombectomy.

Similarly, the third study comparing direct thrombectomy with bridging thrombolysis followed by thrombectomy (the SKIP trial) did not find a significant difference between both strategies.

Promising results with the combination of intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) and mechanical thrombectomy were obtained by the EXTEND-IA TNK Investigators. Intravenous TNK achieved more frequent angiographic reperfusion and tended to achieve better clinical outcomes in several parameters without increasing risk of bleeding.

### Intra-arterial alteplase after successful thrombectomy and functional outcomes in large vessel occlusion stroke… [^488d03a0]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Does the use of adjunct intra-arterial thrombolysis following an angiographically successful thrombectomy improve functional outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 121 adults, treatment with intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 in 59. 0% vs
40. 4% of patients at 90 days. This difference was statistically significant. Objective To investigate whether treatment with adjunct intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy improves outcomes following reperfusion. Design, Setting, and Participants Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from December 2018 through May 2021 in 7 stroke centers in Catalonia, Spain.

The study included 121 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset and with an expanded Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia angiographic score of 2b50 to 3. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication. The Chemical Optimization of Cerebral Embolectomy trial assessed the preliminary efficacy and safety of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase treatment compared with placebo in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy that resulted in successful reperfusion on digital subtraction angiography.

The trial was a multicenter, phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in Catalonia, Spain. Intra-arterial alteplase was compared with intra-arterial placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to a proximal large vessel occlusion treated with thrombectomy that resulted in angiographic findings of success, defined as an eTICI score of 2b50 or greater. In this trial of patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days compared with placebo. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication.

### Endovascular thrombectomy with or without intravenous alteplase in acute stroke [^f2479e55]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study DIRECT-MT was published by Pengfei Yang and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the DIRECT-MT study, the trial question was: is endovascular thrombectomy alone noninferior to endovascular thrombectomy preceded by intravenous alteplase in patients with AIS? In the DIRECT-MT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DIRECT-MT study, the population was: 656 patients (286 female, 370 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS from large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. The key exclusion criteria were disability before the stroke or any contraindication to intravenous alteplase according to the AHA-American Stroke Association guidelines. In the DIRECT-MT study, the interventions were: n = 327 thrombectomy alone (endovascular thrombectomy) n = 329 combination therapy (endovascular thrombectomy preceded by intravenous alteplase at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg of body weight administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset). In the DIRECT-MT study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in mRS score at 90 days (3 points vs. 3 points; aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.4). In the DIRECT-MT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death at 90 days (17.7% vs. 18.8%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.3) Significant decrease in successful reperfusion before thrombectomy (2.4% vs. 7%; OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.74) No significant difference in overall successful reperfusion (79.4% vs. 84.5%; OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). In the DIRECT-MT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, procedural complications, asymptomatic and symptomatic ICH. In the DIRECT-MT study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS from large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, thrombectomy alone was noninferior to combination therapy with respect to mRS score at 90 days.

### Thrombolysis after thrombectomy? Revisiting intra-arterial therapy in the EVT era [^c1d02696]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Three decades after the NINDS trial established intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) as the cornerstone of acute ischemic stroke treatment, the field has made remarkable advances. Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolutionized care for large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. Evidence supports the continued use of IVT before EVT even in the mothership setting. However, as EVT becomes more refined and widely implemented, new questions emerge: When successful recanalization has already been achieved, is there a role for adjunctive thrombolysis?

Intra‐arterial thrombolysis (IAT), once a primary method of reperfusion, fell out of favor with the rise of stent retrievers and aspiration techniques. Nonetheless, the observation that technically successful EVT does not always lead to favorable clinical outcomes has rekindled interest in IAT as a potential adjunct to improve the recanalization of distal vessels and microvascular perfusion.

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, Palaiodimou et al. assess the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of adjunctive IAT following successful EVT. Drawing on data from seven randomized controlled trials involving over 2000 patients, the authors report that IAT was associated with a higher likelihood of excellent functional outcomes at 90 days. A modest benefit was also seen in mRS score shift analysis, indicating reduced overall disability. Importantly, there were no significant differences in rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, mortality, or good functional outcome. The effect was consistent across subgroups, including patients who received IVT and those with complete or near‐complete angiographic reperfusion (eTICI 2c/3).

While the biological rationale is sound, as residual distal occlusions or impaired microvascular flow may persist after EVT, several limitations must temper interpretation. First, the included trials have considerable variability in patient selection, thrombolytic agent, and dose. Although statistical heterogeneity was low, clinical heterogeneity was notable and may affect generalizability. Second, subgroup analyses revealed no clear dose–response effect or difference across reperfusion grades, raising questions about which patients derive the most benefit. Third, as the authors acknowledge, the analysis is based on aggregate‐level data, limiting the ability to explore individual‐level modifiers of treatment response.

### The added benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization by endovascular treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials [^6f4cf311]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite successful recanalization following endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large-vessel occlusion (LVO), many patients fail to achieve excellent functional outcomes. Post-EVT intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) has emerged as a potential adjunctive strategy to improve microvascular reperfusion and clinical recovery.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing IAT plus best medical therapy (BMT) versus BMT alone in LVO-AIS patients with successful recanalization post-EVT. The primary efficacy outcome was 3-month excellent functional outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS)-score: 0–1]. Secondary efficacy outcomes included good functional outcome (mRS-score: 0–2) and reduced disability (mRS-score shift analysis) at 3months. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH); secondary safety outcomes included any-ICH and 3-month all-cause mortality. Subgroup and network meta-analyses were performed evaluating the effects of different thrombolytic agents.

Results

Seven RCTs were included, comprising 1083 patients treated with IAT and 1048 patients treated with BMT alone. IAT was associated with higher likelihood of excellent functional outcome (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11–1.36; I² = 0%) and reduced disability at 3months (common-OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18; I² = 0%) compared with BMT alone. Similar rates of 3-month good functional outcome, 3-month mortality, sICH and any-ICH were observed. Although no significant subgroup differences emerged, in the network meta-analysis alteplase ranked highest in efficacy [surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA): 90%], followed by tenecteplase (61%) and urokinase (40%) in achieving 3-month excellent functional outcome.

Conclusions

IAT improves excellent functional outcomes without compromising safety in LVO-AIS patients with successful recanalization after EVT.

Importance

Persisting or new thrombi in the distal arteries and the microcirculation have been reported to limit the benefits of successful endovascular thrombectomy for patients with acute ischemic stroke. It remains uncertain whether intra-arterial thrombolysis by urokinase following near-complete to complete reperfusion by thrombectomy improves outcomes among patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of intra-arterial urokinase after near-complete to complete reperfusion by thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trial was implemented at 35 hospitals in China, enrolling 535 patients with proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known well, who achieved near-complete or complete reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy and did not receive intravenous thrombolysis prior to the procedure. Recruitment took place between November 15, 2022, and March 29, 2024, with final follow-up on July 4, 2024.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the intra-arterial urokinase group (a single dose of intra-arterial 100 000 IU urokinase injected in the initial target territory; n = 267) or control group (without intra-arterial thrombolysis; n = 267).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients achieving survival without disability (modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1) at 90 days. The primary safety outcomes were mortality at 90 days and incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours.

Results

A total of 535 patients were enrolled (median age, 69 years; 223 [41.8%] female) and 532 (99.6%) completed the trial. The percentage of patients with survival without disability at 90 days was 45.1% (120/266) in the intra-arterial urokinase group and 40.2% (107/266) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.94–1.36]; P = 0.19). Mortality at 90 days (18.4% vs 17.3%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.71–1.59]; P = 0.77) and incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (4.1% vs 4.1%, respectively; adjusted risk ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.45–2.44]; P = 0.91) were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, adjunct intra-arterial urokinase after near-complete to complete reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without disability at 90 days.

### Endovascular thrombectomy and intra-arterial interventions for acute ischaemic stroke [^1ed68be7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most disabling strokes are due to a blockage of a large artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt removal of the clot with intra-arterial thrombolytic drugs or mechanical devices, or both, can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred, leading to improved recovery. However, these so-called endovascular interventions can cause bleeding in the brain. This is a review of randomised controlled trials of endovascular thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis, or both, for acute ischaemic stroke.

Objectives

To assess whether endovascular thrombectomy or intra-arterial interventions, or both, plus medical treatment are superior to medical treatment alone in people with acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and Cochrane Vascular Group (last searched 1 September 2020), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 1 September 2020), MEDLINE (May 2010 to 1 September 2020), and Embase (May 2010 to 1 September 2020). We also searched trials registers, screened reference lists, and contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any endovascular intervention plus medical treatment compared with medical treatment alone in people with definite ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (MBR and MJ) applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. Two review authors (MBR and HL) assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We obtained both published and unpublished data if available. Our primary outcome was favourable functional outcome at the end of the scheduled follow-up period, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. Eighteen trials (i.e. all but one included trial) reported their outcome at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were death from all causes at in the acute phase and by the end of follow-up, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the acute phase and by the end of follow-up, neurological status at the end of follow-up, and degree of recanalisation.

Main Results

We included 19 studies with a total of 3793 participants. The majority of participants had large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation, and were treated within six hours of symptom onset with endovascular thrombectomy. Treatment increased the chance of achieving a good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2: risk ratio (RR) 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 1.63; 3715 participants, 18 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Treatment also reduced the risk of death at end of follow-up: RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 3793 participants, 19 RCTs; high-certainty evidence) without increasing the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the acute phase: RR 1.46 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.36; 1559 participants, 6 RCTs; high-certainty evidence) or by end of follow-up: RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 1752 participants, 10 RCTs; high-certainty evidence); however, the wide confidence intervals preclude any firm conclusion. Neurological recovery to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0 to 1 and degree of recanalisation rates were better in the treatment group: RR 2.03 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.40; 334 participants, 3 RCTs; high-certainty evidence) and RR 3.11 (95% CI 2.18 to 4.42; 268 participants, 3 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

In individuals with acute ischaemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation, endovascular thrombectomy can increase the chance of survival with a good functional outcome without increasing the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage or death.

### Advances in acute ischemic stroke therapy [^8d6cbc7a]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute ischemic stroke continues to advance. The mainstay of treatment remains intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. Recent studies demonstrated that later treatment with alteplase is beneficial in patients selected with advanced imaging techniques. Tenecteplase has been evaluated as an alternative thrombolytic drug and evidence suggests that it is as least as effective as alteplase and may lyse large vessel clots more effectively. Endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy has now been shown to be beneficial up to 24 hours after stroke onset in carefully selected patients with proximal, large vessel occlusions. Ongoing studies are evaluating the effectiveness of thrombectomy in patients with more distal vessel occlusions and patients with proximal large vessel occlusions with larger ischemic core volumes and also in patients with milder neurological deficits. Cytoprotection is another potential acute stroke therapy that has not demonstrated efficacy in prior clinical trials. It should be reconsidered as an adjunct to reperfusion and a variety of new clinical trials can be envisioned to evaluate the potential benefits of cytoprotection in patients before and after reperfusion.

### Acute imaging for evidence-based treatment of ischemic stroke [^54a1636a]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Until recently, intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke treatment relied on reported information on the known time of symptom onset and was limited to treatment within a narrow time window. New trials have provided evidence for imaging-based effective reperfusion treatment in an extended time window and unknown-onset stroke. This review summarizes evidence from recent clinical trials and suggests a simple algorithm for the choice of imaging modalities to guide evidence-based reperfusion treatment of acute stroke.

Recent Findings

Two trials have provided evidence for benefit of mechanical thombectomy in patients with stroke from large vessel occlusion up to 24h after symptom onset or with unknown symptom onset who have a small infarct core but large perfusion lesion or severe clinical deficit (DAWN, DEFUSE-3). An MRI-based trial has demonstrated the benefit of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with unknown onset stroke who present with MRI findings of DWI-FLAIR mismatch (WAKE-UP). Another trial demonstrated benefit of intravenous alteplase in an extended or unknown time-window in patients with penumbral pattern on MRI or CT perfusion (EXTEND).

Summary

In stroke patients with unknown symptom onset or known symptom onset up to 24h, advanced imaging with MRI or with CT perfusion can guide effective acute reperfusion treatment with mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous alteplase.

### Non-pharmacological strategies for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke [^167c8381]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Early recanalisation and an increase in collateral blood supply are predictors of favourable outcome in acute ischaemic stroke. Since individual responses to intravenous treatment with alteplase are heterogeneous, additional intra-arterial thrombolytic and mechanical endovascular treatment is increasingly given. Despite encouraging findings from single-centre studies, data from randomised clinical trials have not proven the hypothesis that interventional recanalisation leads to a better outcome. Advanced thrombectomy devices, the effect of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis, and imaging-guided selection of patients outside the currently approved time-window are all under investigation. Although neuroprotective agents have not shown benefit in clinical trials, non-pharmacological treatment strategies-such as decompressive surgery, therapeutic hypothermia, transcranial laser treatment, or augmentation of cerebral collateral perfusion by different means (eg, partial aortic occlusion or sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation)-are topics of current research. The future of acute stroke therapy relies on evidence for individually tailored, effective, safe, and rapidly accessible treatment probably consisting of combined pharmacological and improved non-pharmacological approaches.

Analysis of current evidence

Six RCTs including Direct Endovascular Treatment vs Bridging Therapy for Patients with Acute Ischaemic Stroke (DEVT), Effect of Mechanical Thrombectomy Without versus With Intravenous Thrombolysis on Functional Outcome Among Patients With Acute Ischaemic Stroke (SKIP), Bridging Thrombolysis versus Direct Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute Ischaemic Stroke, (SWIFT DIRECT), A Randomised Controlled Trial of DIRECT Endovascular Clot Retrieval vs Standard Bridging Thrombolysis With Endovascular Clot Retrieval (DIRECT-SAFE), Intravenous Treatment Followed by Intra-Arterial Treatment versus Direct Intra-Arterial Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke Caused by A Proximal Intracranial Occlusion (MR CLEAN–NO IV), Direct Intra-arterial Thrombectomy in order to Revascularise Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals (DIRECT-MT) have completed to compare the outcomes between intravenous thrombolysis bridging MT and direct MT for LVO in the anterior circulation.DIRECT-MT and DEVT trials found direct MT is non-inferior to bridging MT for favourable functional outcome at 3 months (mRS 0–2), and other RCTs did not find positive results. The Improving Reperfusion Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (IRIS)trial which was the pool analysis of the individual patient data level from the six RCTs did not find direct MT is non-inferior bridging MT (90-day mRS: cOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.04 p = 0.14).

Tenecteplase versus Alteplase Before Endovascular Therapy for Ischaemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK)showed that among patients with confirmed LVO prior to planned MT, administering tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) within 4.5 hours of onset leads to better functional outcomes at 3 months (lower median mRS) compared with alteplase treatment, with no significant differences in safety outcomes between the two.

Recommendation

Patients with indications for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) should undergo treatment as soon as possible. When meeting the criteria for thrombolysis, we recommend that alteplase should be initiated first, while simultaneously considering bridging to MT.

Level of evidence: A

Class of recommendation: I

Patients with indications for MT should undergo treatment as soon as possible. When meeting the criteria for thrombolysis, we suggest that tenecteplase could be initiated first, while simultaneously considering bridging to MT.

Level of evidence: B

Class of recommendation: Ⅱa

In patients with ischaemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion (BAO) of known onset time within 24 hours, does MT lead to better functional outcomes compared with BMM?

### Advances in the management of acute ischemic stroke [^17f02c37]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize the therapeutic advances and evidence in the medical management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recent evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase (TNK) with alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in AIS will be highlighted. Recent advances and evidence on improving micro-circulation following endovascular procedures and neuroprotection will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

A significant number of randomized control studies now support the use of tenecteplase for IVT in AIS. TNK 0.25mg/kg single bolus is as effective and well tolerated as alteplase 0.9mg/kg infusion for IVT in AIS. Evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) has shown effective and well tolerated expansion of the therapeutic window of IVT in the wake-up stroke and up to 9h after last seen well, using advanced neuroimaging with computed tomography perfusion/MRI. Early evidence suggests that intra-arterial alteplase may help improve microcirculation in patients with large vessel occlusion following successful thrombectomy. However, more trials are required to confirm the results. Similarly, early evidence from a recent RCT showed that remote ischemic conditioning confers potential neuroprotection and improves outcomes in AIS.

Summary

Converging evidence has demonstrated that for patients with ischemic stroke presenting at under 4.5h from the onset, TNK is comparable to alteplase. These data along with the practical advantages of TNK have resulted in a shift to replace intravenous TNK as the standard for thrombolysis. Ongoing studies of IVT with TNK are focussed on defining the optimal dose, expanding the time window with multimodal imaging and defining the role of thrombolysis for bridging patients with stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^5a822e6d]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rapid and complete reperfusion is closely related to good clinical outcome of AIS-LVO patients. Successful reperfusion within the first three retrieval attempts was found to be associated with improved clinical outcome, while additional retrieval manoeuvres are associated with a risk for distal embolisation and endothelial injury, hence decreasing the likelihood of successful reperfusion. Many efforts have been made to improve thrombectomy techniques to achieve a higher first-pass reperfusion rate.

The BRETIS-TNK II (Boosting REcanalization of Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke by Intra-arterial TNK II) is the first prospective, multicentre trial to test the hypothesis that intra-arterial TNK during EVT can improve the first-pass reperfusion rate, with improved clinical outcome in AIS-LVO patients. This trial is designed based on two considerations. First, theoretically, adjunctive intra-arterial TNK during EVT would increase the possibility of first successful recanalisation. Intra-arterial thrombolysis was reported in several studies to increase recanalisation and improve clinical outcomes in AIS patients. Second, our pilot study has preliminarily validated the feasibility and safety of this treatment strategy as well as the possible efficacy. We found that intra-arterial infusion of TNK during the first retrieval attempt increased the first-pass successful reperfusion rate and the proportion of functional independence at 90 days, compared with a historical control group of patients with a safe profile.

This trial has two distinct characteristics. First, TNK was chosen in this trial given its higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inhibitors of tissue plasminogen activator, and its high recanalisation ratecompared with alteplase. Second, the unique strategy of intra-arterial thrombolysis will be tested in this trial. The first step is an infusion of 4 mg TNK after the microcatheter navigation across the clot, aiming to dissolve the thrombus in situ as well as possible microthrombus after recanalisation. The second step is intra-arterial administration of TNK via the intermediate or guide catheter during the release of the stent retriever, which can dissolve the thrombus in situ to help increase the successful reperfusion rate without interfering with the EVT procedure. If successful recanalisation is achieved after the stent retriever, intra-arterial TNK will be given similar to the CHOICE (CHemical OptImization of Cerebral Embolectomy in Patients With Acute Stroke Treated With Mechanical Thrombectomy) design.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^632303d8]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The DATE study demonstrated that intra-arterial infusion of tenecteplase at doses of 0.0313 mg/kg or 0.0625 mg/kg, when used as an adjunct to successful reperfusion in patients with anterior circulation LVO, has an adequate safety profile to advance to further testing, whereas the next higher dose of 0.1250 mg/kg exhibited safety concerns due to a high rate of sICH. The 2 doses with an adequate safety profile did not show a statistically significant improvement in disability at 90 days, but the sample size was small, and the trial was not designed to demonstrate efficacy. The study offers valuable insights into optimizing the dosing of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase for future, larger trials.

The phase 1b findings provided a nuanced understanding of the dose-dependent safety profile of intra-arterial tenecteplase. Specifically, the tenecteplase dose, 0.1250 mg/kg, was associated with an increased risk of sICH, highlighting the delicate balance between achieving effective thrombolysis and avoiding adverse bleeding events. In contrast, the lower doses of 0.0313 mg/kg and 0.0625 mg/kg did not significantly increase bleeding risk, suggesting their potential as safer alternatives. Both of these doses continued to show acceptable sICH rates in the larger phase 2a trial stage. In addition, although the results did not reach statistical significance compared with the control group, the observed numerical trend toward efficacy suggests a potential therapeutic benefit that warrants further investigation. Continued research is crucial to fully elucidate the clinical benefits of intra-arterial tenecteplase in optimizing outcomes after EVT. Importantly, the results do not exclude the possibility of a clinically meaningful benefit from intra-arterial tenecteplase. As the dose tiers 0.0313 mg/kg and 0.0625 mg/kg were statistically comparable in phase 2a, both are candidates to advance to a larger phase 2b or phase 3 trial.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular therapy in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion: study protocol and rationale [^d21d7a07]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, a randomized controlled trial showed a beneficial effect of intra-arterial thrombolysis following successful endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. Due to differences in response to thrombolytics in occlusion of the posterior circulation, the purpose of ATTENTION IA is to explore the adjunct benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization in patients presenting with large and medium vessel occlusion of the posterior circulation.

Methods

ATTENTION-IA is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial with open-label treatment and blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE). After achieving successful recanalization (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) 2b-3) of an occlusion of the vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase or standard of care. The primary effect parameter is a modified Rankin Score of 0–1 at day 90.

Results

The trial recently completed enrollment, and data collection/verification is ongoing. The final results will be made available on completion of enrollment and follow-up.

Conclusions

ATTENTION-IA will provide definitive evidence for the efficacy and safety of adjunct intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful EVT in patients with an acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion stroke presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase and first-pass reperfusion in endovascular thrombectomy [^7beaa8dd]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

It is unknown whether thrombolysis with IV tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) influences the probability of first-pass reperfusion when compared with IV alteplase. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of IV thrombolytic choice on this outcome.

Materials and Methods

We investigated the effects of thrombolytic agent (IV tenecteplase or IV alteplase) on first-pass reperfusion in EVT patients from the Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AcT) trial. The primary outcome was first-pass reperfusion, defined as expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) score 2c-3 with a single thrombectomy pass. Secondary outcomes were modified first-pass reperfusion (eTICI 2b-3 after 1 pass), final eTICI score, total number of thrombectomy passes, and time from arterial access to successful reperfusion. Univariable models and generalized linear mixed-effects models with a logit link function were constructed.

Results

Among the 506 patients who underwent EVT in the AcT trial, 445 patients were included (230 [51.7%] women; median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 73 [63–81]). Two hundred twenty-six (50.8%) received IV tenecteplase and 219 patients received IV alteplase (49.2%). First-pass reperfusion and modified first-pass reperfusion was achieved in 169 (38.0%) and 245 (55.1%) patients, respectively. First-pass reperfusion was achieved in 79 (35.0%) IV tenecteplase and 90 (41.1%) IV alteplase patients (P = 0.20). Modified first-pass reperfusion was achieved in 123 (54.4%) IV tenecteplase and 122 (55.7%) IV alteplase patients (P = 0.85). Median (IQR) number of passes was 2 (1–3) in the tenecteplase group and 1 (1–2) in the alteplase group (P = 0.07). Median (IQR) time from arterial access to successful reperfusion was 36 (25–59) minutes and 34 (21–49) minutes in the tenecteplase and alteplase groups, respectively (P = 0.07). There was no difference in final eTICI 2c-3 scores. There were no significant interactions between sex, occlusion site, thrombus length, residual flow, clot burden score, hyperattenuated artery sign, or first-line thrombectomy technique with thrombolysis type on first-pass reperfusion.

Conclusions

IV thrombolytic agent did not influence the probability of first-pass reperfusion.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis following endovascular recanalization for large vessel occlusion stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f22db334]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the treatment effects of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) after endovascular recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). Endovascular recanalization is the standard treatment for large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. Despite successful reperfusion after thrombectomy, fewer than half of the patients regain functional independence at 90 days, highlighting the potential role of impaired microcirculation in poor neurologic outcomes. The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) after endovascular recanalization remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the treatment effects of IAT after endovascular recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to LVO.

Methods

We conducted a study-level systematic review and meta-analysis based on PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, andfrom database inception to February 8, 2025. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy and safety of IAT after endovascular recanalization in large vessel occlusion stroke were included. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. The pooled data were analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores 0–1 at 90 days. Other outcomes included the proportion of patients with mRS scores 0–2 at 90 days, all-cause mortality at 90 days, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and any intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42025639519).

Results

A total of 6 RCTs with 1,985 initially enrolled patients were included in the analysis. A higher proportion of mRS scores 0–1 at 90 days was observed in the IAT group (risk ratio [RR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.11–1.41). No significant differences were found in the proportion of mRS scores 0–2 at 90 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96–1.13) between the groups. Regarding safety outcomes, 90-day all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83–1.21), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76–1.70), and any intracranial hemorrhage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98–1.37) were similar in the IAT group and control group.

Discussion

Among patients with AIS due to LVO, IAT after endovascular recanalization adds additional benefits to functional outcomes, with no increased risk of death or intracranial hemorrhage.

### Letter to the editor regarding "The added benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization by endovascular treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials" recently published by palaiodimou and colleagues [^3d1621a1]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We found the article by Palaiodimou et al. insightful and commend the authors for their rigorous systematic review and meta‐analysis of seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 2131 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior or posterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) and successful recanalization following endovascular treatment (EVT). The authors found that adjunct intra‐arterial thrombolysis (IAT) was associated with significantly higher odds of excellent functional outcome and greater disability reduction at 90 days, without increasing rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), any intracranial hemorrhage, or mortality. The pooled number needed to treat for an excellent outcome was 12, corresponding to a significantly higher likelihood of excellent outcome (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03–1.33; I² = 0%), a clinically meaningful result given that one‐third of patients in the control arm remained functionally dependent despite angiographic success.

Their analysis further suggested that both IA alteplase and tenecteplase were effective, with a reassuring safety profile (pooled sICH 4%, comparable to HERMES EVT data). Benefits were consistent across reperfusion grades and dosing ranges, supporting the hypothesis that IAT enhances microvascular reperfusion and recovery. These results strengthen the rationale for IAT as a targeted, safe, post‐recanalization strategy to close the persistent "angiographic–clinical" gap in LVO stroke care. Additionally, and of particular importance, subgroup analysis showed no evidence that intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) pretreatment influenced the effect of adjunctive IAT on achieving excellent functional outcomes. In addition, there is also growing interest in expanding the use of IAT in patients who have not achieved successful recanalization, as emphasized by the authors in their discussion. We may, however, expect time limitations for IAT, which is likely to increase sICH.

### The added benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization by endovascular treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials [^5ba65795]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Despite successful recanalization following endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large‐vessel occlusion (LVO), many patients fail to achieve excellent functional outcomes. Post‐EVT intra‐arterial thrombolysis (IAT) has emerged as a potential adjunctive strategy to improve microvascular reperfusion and clinical recovery.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing IAT plus best medical therapy (BMT) versus BMT alone in LVO‐AIS patients with successful recanalization post‐EVT. The primary efficacy outcome was 3‐month excellent functional outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS)‐score: 0–1]. Secondary efficacy outcomes included good functional outcome (mRS‐score: 0–2) and reduced disability (mRS‐score shift analysis) at 3 months. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH); secondary safety outcomes included any‐ICH and 3‐month all‐cause mortality. Subgroup and network meta‐analyses were performed evaluating the effects of different thrombolytic agents.

Results

Seven RCTs were included, comprising 1083 patients treated with IAT and 1048 patients treated with BMT alone. IAT was associated with higher likelihood of excellent functional outcome (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11–1.36; I² = 0%) and reduced disability at 3 months (common‐OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18; I² = 0%) compared with BMT alone. Similar rates of 3‐month good functional outcome, 3‐month mortality, sICH and any‐ICH were observed. Although no significant subgroup differences emerged, in the network meta‐analysis alteplase ranked highest in efficacy [surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA): 90%], followed by tenecteplase (61%) and urokinase (40%) in achieving 3‐month excellent functional outcome.

Conclusions

IAT improves excellent functional outcomes without compromising safety in LVO‐AIS patients with successful recanalization after EVT.

### Comparison of intravenous alteplase with a combined intravenous-endovascular approach in patients with stroke and confirmed arterial occlusion (RECANALISE study): a prospective cohort study [^0bbc4f5d]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of intravenous (IV) alteplase is restricted by the speed of recanalisation and the site of the occlusion. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of a combined IV-endovascular approach (intra-arterial alteplase and, if required, additional thrombectomy) in patients with stroke due to arterial occlusion.

Methods

We compared recanalisation rates, neurological improvement at 24 h, and functional outcome at 3 months between two periods (February, 2002, to March, 2007, vs April, 2007, to October, 2008) in patients in a prospective registry who were treated with different regimens of alteplase within 3 h of symptom onset. Patients with confirmed occlusion who were treated before April, 2007, were treated with IV alteplase; after April, 2007, patients were treated with a systematic IV-endovascular approach. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

46 (87%) of 53 patients treated with the IV-endovascular approach achieved recanalisation versus 56 (52%) of 107 patients in the IV group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.21–1.84; p = 0.0002). Early neurological improvement (NIHSS score of 0 or 1 or an improvement of 4 points or more at 24 h) occurred in 32 (60%) patients in the IV-endovascular group and 42 (39%) patients in the IV group (adjusted RR 1.36, 0.97–1.91; p = 0.07). Favourable outcome (mRS of 0–2 at 90 days) occurred in 30 (57%) patients in the IV-endovascular group and 47 (44%) patients in the IV group (adjusted RR 1.16, 0.85–1.58; p = 0.35). The mortality rate at 90 days was 17% in both groups, and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was reported in five (9%) patients in the IV-endovascular group and in 12 (11%) patients in the IV group. Better clinical outcome was associated with recanalisation in both groups and with time to recanalisation in the IV-endovascular group.

Interpretation

An IV-endovascular approach is associated with higher recanalisation rates than is IV alteplase in patients with stroke and confirmed arterial occlusion. In patients treated with an IV-endovascular approach, a shorter time from symptom onset to recanalisation is associated with better clinical outcomes.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^2f15d3f1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase Thrombolysis Followed by Endovascular Therapy

The EXTEND‐IA TNK study (Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase Before Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke)compared the efficacy of tenecteplase (administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) to alteplase in thrombectomy candidates with occlusion of the internal carotid artery, basilar artery, or middle cerebral artery within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The results of the study showed that tenecteplase significantly increased the absolute rate of successful recanalization of large vessels by 12% compared with alteplase. The subsequent EXTEND‐IA TNK part 2 trialis the first substantial head‐to‐head comparison of the 2 candidate doses of tenecteplase for ischemic stroke and showed a similar percentage (19.3%) in > 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory comparing tenecteplase doses of 0.4 and 0.25 mg/kg. There were no significant differences in functional outcomes, all‐cause deaths, and sICH between the 2 groups. These findings suggested that the higher dose of 0.4 mg/kg of tenecteplase did not provide any advantage over the lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg in patients with major vessel occlusion who were scheduled for endovascular thrombectomy. In the 2019 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute stroke guidelines, it was suggested that choosing tenecteplase (administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 25 mg) for bridging therapy patients may be a reasonable option over alteplase (class of recommendation IIb, level of evidence B‐R [moderate level of evidence from randomized clinical trials]).

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^d1041b0d]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Sample Size Calculation

For dose escalation (phase 1b), according to the Chinese Acute Anterior Circulatory Ischemic Stroke Endovascular Treatment Registry Study, 13.8% of patients experienced sICH within 24 hours of receiving EVT. Using sample sizes typical for dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trials, we used a 14 + 8 design scheme with the occurrence of sICH within 24 hours after EVT as the dose-limiting toxic effect. At each tier, 14 patients were enrolled, beginning with the lowest prespecified dose. If fewer than 2 of 14 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the 14 patients developed sICH, 8 more patients were enrolled at that dose. If 0 to 1 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH or 3 of the first 14 developed sICH, that dose was deemed not tolerated and the immediately preceding dose was the estimated maximum tolerated dose.

For dose expansion (phase 2a), patients enrolled were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the dose A group, the dose B group, and the control group.

### Adjunct thrombolysis enhances brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy [^018c451b]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to investigate whether adjunct alteplase improves brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy.

Methods

This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 36 patients (mean [standard deviation] = 70.8 [13.5] years old, 18 [50%] women) with large vessel occlusion undergoing thrombectomy resulting in near-normal (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] b50/67/2c, n = 23, 64%) or normal angiographic reperfusion (eTICI 3, n = 13, 36%). Seventeen patients were randomized to intra-arterial alteplase (0.225mg/kg), and 19 received placebo. At 48hours, patients had brain perfusion/diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of patients with areas of hypoperfusion on MRI. Secondary outcomes were the infarct expansion ratio (final to initial infarction volume), and the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak relative to total creatine as a marker of neuronal integrity.

Results

The prevalence of hypoperfusion was 24% with intra-arterial alteplase, and 58% with placebo (adjusted odds ratio = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04–0.91, p = 0.03). Among 14 patients with final eTICI 3 scores, hypoperfusion was found in 1 of 7 (14%) in the alteplase group and 3 of 7 (43%) in the placebo group. Abnormal brain perfusion was associated with worse functional outcome at day 90. Alteplase significantly reduced the infarct expansion ratio compared with placebo (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 0.7 [0.5–1.2] vs 3.2 [1.8–5.7], p = 0.01) and resulted in higher NAA peaks (median [IQR] = 1.13 [0.91–1.36] vs 1.00 [0.74–1.22], p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

There is a high prevalence of areas of hypoperfusion following thrombectomy despite successful reperfusion on angiography. Adjunct alteplase enhances brain reperfusion, which results in reduced expansion of the infarction and improved neuronal integrity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:860–870.

### Recanalisation therapy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large artery occlusion: choice of therapeutic strategy according to underlying aetiological mechanism? [^1f831a3d]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Impact of aetiological mechanisms underlying LAO on the outcomes of recanalisation therap

Recanalisation therapy involving intravenous thrombolysis and MT have been recommended as the first-line therapeutic protocol for AIS due to LAO. Moreover, successful recanalisation correlates closely, though not necessarily, with favourable clinical outcomes. Aetiological mechanisms underlying occlusion classified according to the Trial of Org 10 172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria has been demonstrated to influence the effect of recanalisation therapy in some series of AIS treated with thrombolysis. In a series of 72 patients with AIS caused by proximal MCA occlusion and treated with intravenous alteplase in 3 hours, recanalisation was earlier, faster and more complete in CE stroke compared with large artery atherosclerotic stroke. A retrospective analysis of data collected from 1031 consecutive patients with AIS treated with intravenous thrombolysis found that disappearance of hyperdense MCA sign, a surrogate imaging marker of successful recanalisation, was more common in CE stroke than in large artery atherosclerotic stroke. No recanalisation was observed in 49% of atherosclerotic group, while in only 2% of CE group in a series of 76 patients treated with intra-arterial (IA) pro-urokinase. Some imaging features of the occluded segments of artery might reflect the aetiological mechanisms of occlusion and be used as an imaging marker to predict the effect of recanalisation therapy. In a systematic review, hyperdense thrombi were found to be associated with higher proportion of red blood cell components, which may be a histological marker of CE, although controversy still exists. Thrombi with lower density on non-contrast CT (NCCT) appeared to be more resistant to both pharmacological lysis and MT. Permeability of thrombus was associated with the rate of successful recanalisation after intravenous alteplase treatment. Pervious thrombi most likely are those newly formed cardiogenic or in situ thrombi.

### Adjunctive thrombolytics after successful endovascular reperfusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^83444e6c]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) remain uncertain, with recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielding conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of IAT following successful EVT in patients with LVOS.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Library databases, and the International Stroke Conference 2025 abstracts to identify RCTs evaluating IAT following successful EVT from January 2015 to February 2025. The primary outcome was the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at 90days). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS = 0–2). Safety measures included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality at 90days. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250651602).

Results

The primary pooled analysis of 6 RCTs (N = 1,974) showed that IAT significantly increased the likelihood of achieving excellent functional outcome at 90days (mRS = 0–1: odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.80, p < 0.001), with a notable effect in anterior circulation (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, p < 0.001) but not in posterior circulation LVOS (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.83–2.74, p = 0.18). Among thrombolytic drugs, alteplase was most strongly associated with favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–1: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.31–2.87, p < 0.001), followed by tenecteplase (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.08–1.89, p = 0.01). No significant safety concerns were observed, as there was no increase in the odds of sICH (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.75–1.75, p = 0.51) or 90-day mortality (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79–1.26, p = 0.99). Sensitivity analyses for all outcomes yielded consistent results.

Interpretation

IAT following successful EVT significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving an excellent functional outcome, particularly in anterior circulation strokes. Although the benefit in posterior circulation strokes remains uncertain, the lack of significant differences in sICH risk and mortality across thrombolytic drugs and stroke locations support the safety of IAT.

### Rapid systematic review: intra-arterial thrombectomy ("Clot retrieval") for selected patients with acute ischemic stroke [^394a5ec0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. However, precisely defining the optimal treatment for individual patients early after AIS onset remains elusive. There has recently been a surge in published studies documenting the effectiveness of mechanical intra-arterial thrombectomy for treatment of a subset of patients with AIS. This therapy has been proposed and studied for the small (< 1.2%) subgroup of patients with ischemic strokes who have "large vessel" strokes or strokes that fail to improve after the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The current rapid systematic review provides practicing emergency physicians updated information regarding mechanical thrombectomy as a treatment option for carefully selected AIS patients.

Methods

A PubMed literature search was conducted from January 1996 to June 2016 and limited to human clinical trials written in English with relevant keywords. High-quality randomized controlled studies identified then underwent a structured review.

Results

In total, 179 papers fulfilling the search criteria were screened and 8 appropriate articles were rigorously reviewed in detail and recommendations given on the effectiveness and indication of mechanical intra-arterial thrombectomy for the treatment of AIS.

Conclusions

Mechanical intra-arterial thrombectomy reduces long-term disability in a properly selected subset of patients who have an AIS caused by large vessel occlusion. Many of these patients will have failed to improve after intravenous administration of t-PA, and mortality is not increased when combined with t-PA. Careful screening criteria should be in place to identify the limited subset of patients to whom this therapy is delivered to derive optimal treatment benefits.

### Comparative effectiveness of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke: a population-based analysis [^6c12874f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The MR CLEAN, SWIFT‐PRIME (Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment), EXTEND‐IA (Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits — Intra‐Arterial), and REVASCAT (Randomized Trial of Revascularization with Solitaire FR Device versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset) trials found no difference in mortality between their EVT groups and medical treatment groups. 19, 20, 21, 22 In contrast, the ESCAPE trial documented reduced mortality in the EVT group at 90 days (10.4% versus 19.0%; rate ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–1.0), a result that we believe is likely because of the fast treatment times observed in this trial. 9 In our current study, EVT was not associated with mortality. Stratification by intravenous alteplase status showed that the subgroup who had received only EVT but no intravenous alteplase had the highest mortality rate and a median onset‐to‐treatment time that was > 60 minutes longer than the subgroup who received intravenous alteplase only and > 90 minutes longer than the subgroup who received both EVT and intravenous alteplase. An average patient with acute ischemic stroke caused by large‐vessel occlusion loses 1.9 million neurons each minute in which the stroke is untreated, and delayed presentation is a strong predictor of poor outcome and mortality. 23 With the delay in onset‐to‐treatment time comes the observed higher mortality in the EVT only group, which might be an important reason why we were not able to replicate the survival benefit of EVT overall in this study.

### Tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy enhances 1-h recanalization and reduces disability in large-vessel occlusion [^aa5d920d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, we assessed the impact of occlusion location and clot burden on the efficacy of tenecteplase and alteplase in achieving recanalization for large-vessel occlusion. We found both tenecteplase and alteplase are generally ineffective in achieving recanalization in cases of ICA or basilar artery occlusion and high clot burden. Conversely, for small vessel occlusions, the TRACE- 2 trial demonstrated that both drugs were effective in moderate acute ischemic stroke patients who did not receive mechanical thrombectomy. Favorable outcomes (mRS 0–2) at 90 days was similar for both tenecteplase (73%) and alteplase (72%), showing no significant difference in efficacy. However, our findings are limited by a small sample size, which prevented us from detecting a significant difference in recanalization effects between tenecteplase and alteplase, regardless of the occlusion location and clot burden. Table 3 seems to align with the previous report, which indicated superior recanalization rates with tenecteplase in patients with occlusions in the middle cerebral artery and lower clot burden. Furthermore, tenecteplase has been shown to have better functional outcomes than alteplase in a study that primarily included the middle cerebral artery. In conclusion, the effect of tenecteplase and alteplase varies depending on the specific occlusion site and clot characteristics.

### Endovascular thrombectomy with versus without intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke [^1dda178e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Acute ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Once diagnosed, treatment is generally limited to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular thrombectomy, or both. Intravenous thrombolysis has theoretical benefits (enhancing reperfusion, dissolving smaller thrombi) and harms (delaying time to endovascular intervention, allergic reaction, increased bleeding risk).

Objectives

To assess the effects of endovascular thrombectomy with IVT versus without IVT on functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) < 3) within 90 days in people with acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registries to November 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults with acute ischaemic stroke who received endovascular therapy and were randomised to either intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours or a control.

Outcomes

Outcomes were: functional independence (mRS score < 3), excellent functional outcome (mRS score < 2), mortality, asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, successful revascularisation (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 2b to 3), and complete revascularisation (TICI grade 3 only), within 90 days.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the following potential sources of bias for each outcome: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result.

Synthesis Methods

We pooled outcome data using the random-effects model and performed meta-analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of pooled data by visually inspecting forest plots to consider the direction and magnitude of effects, and used the χ² test and I² statistic to quantify the heterogeneity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included six studies, with a total of 2336 participants (1166 control and 1170 intervention). The mean age was 71 years. There were 1034 women and 1302 men. Four studies used alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, one study used alteplase 0.6 mg/kg, and one study used either alteplase 0.9 mg/kg or tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg. There were no important variations in the outcomes reported across studies.

Synthesis Of Results

All six studies were at overall low risk of bias for each outcome. There was probably little to no difference in functional independence between the IVT and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.14; P = 0.62; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in excellent functional outcome between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; P = 0.67; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; P = 0.54; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29; P = 0.06; 6 studies, 2334 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.70; P = 0.31; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of successful revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; P = 0.008; 6 studies, 2326 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of complete revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28; P = 0.02; 5 studies, 2037 participants; high-certainty evidence). Limitations included: differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria between studies (e.g. age thresholds, pre-existing comorbidities or baseline functional status, time periods, diagnostic imaging, specific vessels); specific endovascular device used; thrombolysis medication and dose; and potential conflict of interest, as multiple study authors reported receiving funding or fees from pharmaceutical companies. For functional independence, assessed as an mRS score < 3 within 90 days, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level due to a high I² value, indicating that heterogeneity may be substantial for this outcome. For symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 90 days, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level because the 95% CI included both important benefits and important harms.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence does not currently support a clear benefit or harm for routine intravenous thrombolysis amongst people receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Amongst participants receiving endovascular thrombectomy, IVT did not demonstrate evidence of a difference in functional independence, excellent functional outcome, mortality, and asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, when compared with no IVT. However, IVT did result in a higher rate of successful and complete revascularisation when compared with no IVT. Future research should include more high-quality trials to further evaluate the role of intravenous thrombolysis in people receiving endovascular thrombectomy to provide more robust data and further narrow the confidence intervals. Future research should also identify whether time- and person-specific factors influence the effect of IVT amongst those receiving endovascular thrombectomy.

### Intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular therapy for large vessel strokes can lead to significantly higher hospital costs without improving outcomes [^bb807b70]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 24 patients per 100 000 people per year in the USA have an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to a large vessel occlusion (LVO). These strokes are more severe and are less likely to respond to IV administered therapies than other types of ischemic stroke. A number of trials have shown improved outcomes following endovascular therapy for LVO strokes compared with standard therapies alone. However, the number of patients treated without prior IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was small. The question of whether IV rt-PA before rapid endovascular treatment helps or harms the patient with LVO stroke therefore remains unanswered. It is possible that IV rt-PA prior to mechanical therapies has no effect on the outcome of LVO strokes, as shown by two recent meta-analyses. If this is the case, then the additional cost of IV rt-PA may be burdensome to the patients and their insurers as a 100 mg vial of alteplase (Activase, Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA) used in the preparation of an IV dose for stroke thrombolysis costs our hospital $7800; 2 years ago the cost was $6000.

Patients with an LVO may do better with IV thrombolysis compared with no treatementso, in the absence of endovascular therapy, IV rt-PA for LVO strokes may be justified. However, when endovascular therapy is readily available, the rationale for administering this drug to all patients with LVO without a proven benefit can be questioned. Trials confirming the superior efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy did not show an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with endovascular therapy following IV thrombolysis. This lack of harm may not be sufficient justification to maintain the current standard since a complete definition of harm includes the cost to society — a true measure of which also includes the opportunity cost of the therapeutic approach. In total these can be substantial, considering the multiple other steps in the stroke chain that can be improved with additional resources. In the evolving landscape for ischemic stroke treatment, a paradigm change might be required to reflect the current evidence — a paradigm that includes socioeconomic aspects of delivering that care. There may be an adjunctive role for pharmacological thrombolysis; however, it is possible that the thrombolytic agent, such as rt-PA, is more efficacious when administered IA in conjunction with mechanical thrombectomy than the IV administration of a larger dose.

### Interventionalist perspective on the new endovascular trials [^c6148192]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Three recently published trials have conclusively proven the benefit of mechanical endovascular thrombectomy over best medical therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion. These trials shared some features and differed in others. These similarities and differences in trial design and execution affect the conclusions and recommendations that can be made from the data. We will examine the implications of these studies for neurointerventionists, both for current practice and for future studies. In particular, we will focus on procedural details such as patient selection, devices, adjunctive therapies, treatment time windows, and performance metrics.

### ACR-ASNR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of endovascular thrombectomy and revascularization in acute STRoke [^b92aa0a5]. SIR (2024). High credibility.

Thrombolysis in acute stroke — definition, approved agent, and timing are specified as follows: A method of dissolving a thromboembolus within an occluded vessel using a fibrinolytic medication, such as alteplase. At this time, alteplase is the only FDA-approved medication for use for patients with acute stroke and is only FDA-approved for IV use within 3 hours from time of onset or last known well. Per AHA/ASA guidelines, IV alteplase may be used up to 4.5 hours from onset or last known well in select, eligible patients, and the intra-arterial administration of thrombolytics is considered "off-label" for acute stroke patients.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^fef5111e]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the design of this trial, two major concerns were considered in advance: the dose of intra-arterial TNK and the sample size of the trial. A study on intra-arterial TNK for the treatment of AIS indicated that administration of intra-arterial TNK with a dose ranging from 1.5 mg to 10 mg had similar safety and favourable outcomes compared with intra-arterial alteplase or reteplase in AIS patients. Furthermore, intra-arterial 0.4 mg/min TNK seemed safe and showed potential benefit in the BRETIS-TNK study. Given these results and the potential risk of sICH across different subgroups, different doses of intra-arterial TNK were chosen in this trial after discussion with the steering committee, with the aim to minimise sICH risk. The second major concern of the trial was the sample size. Given the potential for removal of a subgroup in the event of a safety concern, an adaptive increase in sample size would be performed with statistician support when the interim results are reported.

### Tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy enhances 1-h recanalization and reduces disability in large-vessel occlusion [^341f8d49]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings indicate that tenecteplase is significantly more effective than alteplase in achieving early recanalization when the IVT-to-puncture time is under 1 h. In addition, tenecteplase also leads to a higher rate of recovery to independent or mildly disabled function (mRS 0–3) at 3 months. Furthermore, the administration of tenecteplase significantly reduced the time from hospital arrival to the initiation of thrombolysis and thrombectomy.

Our analysis of ER rates, with a median IVT-to-puncture time of 67 min, shows the similarity between the tenecteplase and alteplase groups, with ER rates of 17.1% and 12.1%, respectively. This observation is consistent with the ER rates from previous studies that reported longer IVT-to-puncture times, demonstrating rates of 19.8% versus 18.5% with a median evaluation time of 88 min, and 21% versus 18% with 93 min. In the EXTEND-IA-TNK trial, a shorter IVT to arterial puncture time (median of 43 min) showed significantly higher ER rates for tenecteplase compared to alteplase (22% vs. 10%). However, in the AcT trial, also with shorter IVT to reperfusion assessment time (median of 53 min), ER rates were around 10%, with no significant differences between tenecteplase and alteplase. Prior studies have provided inconsistent findings and did not stratify recanalization rates based on IVT-to-puncture time intervals. Our analysis suggests a trend of progressively decreasing disparity in recanalization rates between tenecteplase and alteplase as IVT-to-puncture times increased, until no significant difference remained.

### Intravenous tenecteplase compared with alteplase for minor ischaemic stroke: a secondary analysis of the AcT randomised clinical trial [^746e61a0]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, randomisation was not stratified by baseline NIHSS; therefore, the effect of unmeasured confounders on the analysis cannot be discounted. Second, there were baseline differences in the number of patients with vessel occlusion and utilisation of endovascular thrombectomy between the groups, both higher in the tenecteplase group. Third, due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, no screening logs were maintained, and it was left to the discretion of enrolling physicians regarding which minor strokes to enrol. Since patients were enrolled based on current Canadian guidelines for thrombolysis, most patients with minor strokes likely had disabling deficits, although this was not possible to confirm. Finally, this is a post-hoc secondary analysis that is inadequately powered to detect group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes. The results should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating.

Conclusions

In patients who had an acute stroke enrolled in the AcT Study presenting with minor deficits, safety and efficacy outcomes with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg were not significantly different from alteplase 0.9 mg/kg. In these patients, tenecteplase may be a reasonable alternative to alteplase for those meeting standard indications for thrombolysis; however, further adequately powered studies in the population who had a minor stroke are needed to confirm these results.

### Endovascular reperfusion strategies for acute stroke [^c48203ab]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke is the most common cause of permanent disability, the second most common cause of dementia, and the third most common cause of death in the Western world. About 10% to 20% of strokes are due to large-artery occlusions causing severe disabling strokes. Recently, 5 randomized controlled trials established mechanical thrombectomy in stroke treatment in patients with large-vessel occlusions. The current intra-arterial reperfusion therapies allow high recanalization rates, high rates of favorable clinical outcome, and low complication rates. This review discusses the results of recent randomized trials and describes the current state-of-the-art endovascular treatment in acute ischemic stroke.

### Imaging features and safety and efficacy of endovascular stroke treatment: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data [^8d2477d9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding whether imaging can be used effectively to select patients for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is scarce. We aimed to investigate the association between baseline imaging features and safety and efficacy of EVT in acute ischaemic stroke caused by anterior large-vessel occlusion.

Methods

In this meta-analysis of individual patient-level data, the HERMES collaboration identified in PubMed seven randomised trials in endovascular stroke that compared EVT with standard medical therapy, published between Jan 1, 2010, and Oct 31, 2017. Only trials that required vessel imaging to identify patients with proximal anterior circulation ischaemic stroke and that used predominantly stent retrievers or second-generation neurothrombectomy devices in the EVT group were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane handbook methodology. Central investigators, masked to clinical information other than stroke side, categorised baseline imaging features of ischaemic change with the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) or according to involvement of more than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory, and by thrombus volume, hyperdensity, and collateral status. The primary endpoint was neurological functional disability scored on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days after randomisation. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, parenchymal haematoma type 2 within 5 days of randomisation, and mortality within 90 days. For the primary analysis, we used mixed-methods ordinal logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, intravenous alteplase, and time from onset to randomisation, and we used interaction terms to test whether imaging categorisation at baseline modifies the association between treatment and outcome. This meta-analysis was prospectively designed by the HERMES executive committee but has not been registered.

Findings

Among 1764 pooled patients, 871 were allocated to the EVT group and 893 to the control group. Risk of bias was low except in the THRACE study, which used unblinded assessment of outcomes 90 days after randomisation and MRI predominantly as the primary baseline imaging tool. The overall treatment effect favoured EVT (adjusted common odds ratio [cOR] for a shift towards better outcome on the mRS 2·00, 95% CI 1·69–2·38; p < 0·0001). EVT achieved better outcomes at 90 days than standard medical therapy alone across a broad range of baseline imaging categories. Mortality at 90 days (14·7% vs 17·3%, p = 0·15), symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (3·8% vs 3·5%, p = 0·90), and parenchymal haematoma type 2 (5·6% vs 4·8%, p = 0·52) did not differ between the EVT and control groups. No treatment effect modification by baseline imaging features was noted for mortality at 90 days and parenchymal haematoma type 2. Among patients with ASPECTS 0–4, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was seen in ten (19%) of 52 patients in the EVT group versus three (5%) of 66 patients in the control group (adjusted cOR 3·94, 95% CI 0·94–16·49; p interaction = 0·025), and among patients with more than 33% involvement of middle cerebral artery territory, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was observed in 15 (14%) of 108 patients in the EVT group versus four (4%) of 113 patients in the control group (4·17, 1·30–13·44, p interaction = 0·012).

Interpretation

EVT achieves better outcomes at 90 days than standard medical therapy across a broad range of baseline imaging categories, including infarcts affecting more than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory or ASPECTS less than 6, although in these patients the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was higher in the EVT group than the control group. This analysis provides preliminary evidence for potential use of EVT in patients with large infarcts at baseline.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^b12bee15]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — EMS systems recommendations specify that regional systems of stroke care should be developed with facilities for initial emergency care including administration of IV alteplase and centers capable of performing endovascular stroke treatment; EMS leaders should develop triage paradigms and protocols to ensure rapid identification and assessment using a validated and standardized stroke screening tool; patients with a positive stroke screen or who are strongly suspected to have a stroke should be transported rapidly to the closest healthcare facilities able to administer IV alteplase; when several IV alteplase–capable hospital options exist within a defined geographic region, the benefit of bypassing the closest to reach a higher level of stroke care, including mechanical thrombectomy, is uncertain; and effective prehospital procedures should be developed to identify patients ineligible for IV thrombolysis with a strong probability of large vessel occlusion for rapid transport to facilities able to perform mechanical thrombectomy.

### Insights into variations in preferred selection criteria for acute stroke endovascular therapy [^3781ffd9]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Endovascular thrombectomy (ET) is safe, effective, and cost-effective for large artery occlusion ischemic stroke, even if under different selection criteria.

Purpose

To study the preferences for ET selection criteria by surveying clinicians and consumers, where number needed to treat to achieve functional independence is the only factor being considered.

Methods

A survey providing visual representation of the proportion of patients treated and expected functional outcomes, based on the selection criteria in each of the recent randomized trials of ET, was distributed nationwide in Australia and New Zealand to clinicians and consumers. The preferred selection criteria were identified by the frequency of first choice and using decision-analysis techniques to assess consensus by treating respondents as a panel of experts and aggregating their preferences on selection criteria.

Results

104 clinicians and 107 consumer respondents (43/107 (40%) stroke survivors) took part in the study. Selection criteria of EXTEND-IA were ranked as the most preferred by the consensus process analysis and were the first choice of 64 individual clinicians (61.5%; 95%CI 52% to 71%). ESCAPE trial selection criteria were ranked as the most preferred option and chosen by 42 individual consumers (39%; 95%CI 29% to 48%). Most clinicians based their choice on the ratio of patients benefiting from ET, while consumers considered the absolute number of patients benefiting.

Conclusions

Consumers favor maximization of the absolute number achieving good outcome in comparison with clinicians. This finding suggests that less restrictive criteria may be favored in clinical practice.
