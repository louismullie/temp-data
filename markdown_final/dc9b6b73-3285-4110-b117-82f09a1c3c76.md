## Question

Topical antibiotics for AOM tympanostomy tubes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical antibiotics for acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the first-line treatment recommendation and its strength. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data versus oral antibiotics and observation. After that, I need to check the role of steroid-containing drops and the microbiology supporting topical therapy. I will then examine safety and ototoxicity considerations, including which drops to avoid. I should confirm dosing, duration, and administration technique. Finally, I will consider exceptions requiring systemic therapy, perioperative and postoperative management nuances, and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm with cost-effectiveness context [^115ZEdUq] [^116xDc79].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and diagnostic criteria. AOMT is acute otorrhea through functioning tympanostomy tubes, typically defined as discharge for less than 4 weeks, and "uncomplicated" implies no high fever, no cellulitis beyond the external canal, no concurrent systemic illness requiring antibiotics, and an immunocompetent host; prevalence varies widely, with up to about half of children experiencing otorrhea in closely monitored cohorts, so I need to ensure I'm not overcalling severity in the absence of red flags [^115ZEdUq] [^113qYyU9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment modality. I should verify the first-line recommendation. The updated AAO-HNSF guideline issues a strong recommendation to use topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, and this is echoed across multiple guideline summaries and action statements, which aligns with a stewardship-first approach given the direct access of drops to the middle ear via the tube [^115ZEdUq] [^116Soora] [^113JCGoJ] [^113gPn3q].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit versus oral therapy and observation. In a pragmatic NEJM RCT, antibiotic–glucocorticoid eardrops achieved only 5% otorrhea at 2 weeks versus 44% with oral amoxicillin–clavulanate and 55% with initial observation, with faster cessation of otorrhea and fewer recurrences; similarly, a randomized trial showed ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone achieved clinical cure in 85% versus 59% with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate and stopped otorrhea faster, reinforcing topical superiority for AOMT [^116xDc79] [^115xCujW].

> I will now examine whether adding a corticosteroid to the antibiotic improves outcomes. Let me consider the steroid component carefully. Multiple randomized studies show that ciprofloxacin plus a steroid (dexamethasone or fluocinolone) accelerates time to cessation of otorrhea and increases clinical cure versus ciprofloxacin alone, with a representative trial showing median time to cessation around 4.2 days with ciprofloxacin–fluocinolone versus about 7.0 days with ciprofloxacin alone; this anti-inflammatory add-on appears clinically meaningful in reducing symptom burden and duration [^112iqTm4] [^114aK8YY].

> But wait, what if the microbiology argues against topical therapy? I should double-check the pathogen profile. AOMT cultures frequently yield Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus alongside traditional AOM pathogens, and these organisms are often not covered by oral beta-lactams approved for children; in contrast, topical fluoroquinolones achieve very high local concentrations and provide reliable coverage, which mechanistically explains the superior clinical response and supports choosing a quinolone-based drop as first-line [^111VLurV] [^113ifRTC].

> Safety and ototoxicity must be verified next. I need to ensure we avoid ototoxic agents when the tympanic membrane is nonintact. Guidelines advise using only non-ototoxic topical preparations in the presence of a perforation or tympanostomy tube; specifically, avoid aminoglycosides such as neomycin or gentamicin because of the risk of sensorineural hearing loss with middle ear exposure, and favor fluoroquinolone drops, which are FDA-approved for middle ear use in this setting and have an excellent safety record in short courses [^114D5nMV] [^112TDfG3] [^116yKq2Q].

> Let me think about dosing, duration, and administration technique. Standard regimens use ciprofloxacin 0.3% with dexamethasone 0.1% at about 4 drops twice daily for 7 days, or ciprofloxacin 0.3% with fluocinolone 0.025% at about 3–4 drops twice daily for 7 days; caregivers should position the affected ear up for 30–60 seconds and use tragal pumping to facilitate penetration through the tube, and clinicians should perform aural toilet or consider a wick if edema or debris impedes delivery, which meaningfully improves outcomes in practice surveys and aligns with AOE guidance on optimizing topical delivery [^111qJzSU] [^112iqTm4] [^117YHBFM] [^116ZLvWP].

> I should confirm expected response and when to reassess. With appropriate topical therapy, otorrhea typically resolves within 4–6 days; if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours, I need to check for tube obstruction, persistent biofilm or granulation, misdiagnosis such as otitis externa, or evolution to complicated disease, and consider suctioning the tube lumen, switching to an alternative non-ototoxic topical agent, or adding systemic therapy if red flags emerge [^112iqTm4] [^113ifRTC].

> Now, I need to ensure I identify exceptions requiring systemic antibiotics. Systemic therapy is indicated when there is cellulitis of the pinna or adjacent skin, concurrent bacterial infection elsewhere, high fever or toxic appearance, immunocompromise, failure of appropriate topical therapy, or inability to administer drops; in these scenarios, amoxicillin–clavulanate remains a common first choice for systemic coverage, but I should tailor to local resistance and clinical context and coordinate with ENT if refractory [^113ifRTC] [^115ZEdUq] [^116xDc79].

> Next, I should review perioperative and postoperative nuances. Hold on, I should verify whether routine postoperative drops help. The updated guideline recommends against routine postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tube placement, as high-quality evidence shows no consistent benefit and potential for overuse; exceptions include active AOM or purulent effusion at the time of insertion, where a single intraoperative application may be considered, but prolonged postoperative courses are discouraged [^115PZqaU] [^1125UTaw] [^116KjAEU].

> Let me reconsider water precautions, since families often ask. Initially, I thought routine water precautions might reduce otorrhea, but wait, the updated guideline advises against routine, prophylactic water precautions for children with tympanostomy tubes, and meta-analytic data show no compelling benefit; practically, I counsel avoiding dirty or contaminated water exposure while symptomatic and resuming normal activities once drainage resolves, aligning with the no-routine-precautions stance [^113JCGoJ] [^1123TBrh].

> I should double-check cost-effectiveness to support shared decision-making. Antibiotic–glucocorticoid eardrops are not only clinically superior but also less costly than oral antibiotics or observation at 2 weeks and 6 months in economic analyses of the NEJM trial, reinforcing topical therapy as the value-based choice for uncomplicated AOMT [^114PRBoq].

> To synthesize, let me outline the practical algorithm and verify alignment with guidelines. For a child with acute, uncomplicated tympanostomy tube otorrhea, prescribe a non-ototoxic topical fluoroquinolone drop, preferably ciprofloxacin with dexamethasone or fluocinolone, for about 7 days with proper administration technique; avoid oral antibiotics initially; reassess at 48–72 hours if not improving and escalate to systemic therapy only if complicated or refractory; and avoid routine postoperative drops or water precautions, documenting shared decision-making and arranging follow-up until tube extrusion [^115ZEdUq] [^116Soora] [^115PZqaU] [^113JCGoJ].

Topical antibiotics are the **first-line therapy** for acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes, with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone favored for faster symptom resolution and higher cure rates than antibiotic-only drops [^112iqTm4] [^111qJzSU]. Ofloxacin is a **safe alternative** when ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is unavailable or contraindicated [^1162V5CJ]. Routine oral antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated cases because of lower efficacy and higher adverse effects [^116xDc79] [^115xCujW]; reserve systemic therapy for cellulitis, persistent symptoms, or immunocompromise [^113ifRTC]. Use non-ototoxic drops, avoid aminoglycosides, and treat for 7–10 days with follow-up if symptoms persist [^114D5nMV] [^112TDfG3].

---

## Indications for topical antibiotic use

Topical antibiotics are indicated for **acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO)** — acute otorrhea of less than 4 weeks' duration in children with tympanostomy tubes [^115ZEdUq]. They are also indicated for **chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)** with persistent otorrhea lasting more than 2 weeks [^112zH3x1].

---

## Commonly used topical antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Formulation** | **Spectrum of activity** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ciprofloxacin | 0.3% otic solution | - Gram-negative (Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, Moraxella) <br/> - Some Gram-positive (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) | - High efficacy <br/> - Faster symptom resolution with added steroid [^112iqTm4] [^114QFZc3] |
| Ofloxacin | 0.3% otic solution | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Including Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus | - Safe and effective alternative [^1162V5CJ] [^1161Z7XV] |
| Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone | Otic suspension | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria | - Effective but potential ototoxicity with prolonged use [^112TDfG3] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Topical antibiotics are **superior to oral antibiotics** for acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, with higher cure rates and faster symptom resolution [^116xDc79] [^115xCujW]. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone achieves **faster cessation of otorrhea and higher cure rates** than ciprofloxacin alone or ofloxacin [^114aK8YY] [^111qJzSU]. Ofloxacin is effective and safe, particularly for **Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus** [^1162V5CJ] [^1161Z7XV].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Ototoxicity**: Non-ototoxic fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) are preferred; avoid aminoglycosides (neomycin, gentamicin) due to potential ototoxicity, especially with prolonged use or perforated tympanic membrane [^112TDfG3] [^114D5nMV].

- **Adverse effects**: Local irritation, itching, and mild discomfort are common but generally well tolerated [^112iqTm4] [^111qJzSU].

- **Systemic absorption**: Minimal systemic absorption with topical fluoroquinolones, reducing risk of systemic side effects [^114D5nMV].

---

## Duration of treatment

The **standard duration** is 7–10 days, with clinical improvement expected within 48–72 hours. Follow-up should occur if symptoms persist beyond this window or if complications are suspected [^114D5nMV].

---

## Comparison with systemic antibiotics

Topical antibiotics are **more effective than systemic antibiotics** for acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, with higher cure rates, faster symptom resolution, and fewer adverse effects [^116xDc79] [^115xCujW]. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for complicated cases — such as cellulitis, persistent symptoms, or immunocompromised patients [^113ifRTC].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines recommend **topical antibiotic ear drops as first-line therapy** for uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, without routine oral antibiotics [^115ZEdUq] [^113JCGoJ]. They also advise using non-ototoxic preparations and avoiding aminoglycosides when the tympanic membrane is perforated or tympanostomy tubes are present [^112TDfG3] [^114D5nMV].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Administration technique**: Proper administration, including tragal pumping and keeping the ear upright, enhances drug delivery [^117YHBFM].

- **Patient adherence**: Convenient dosing regimens (twice daily) improve adherence and outcomes [^1162V5CJ].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Topical antibiotics are cost-effective, reducing healthcare utilization and adverse effects [^114PRBoq].

---

Topical antibiotics, especially ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone, are the **preferred first-line treatment** for acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, offering superior efficacy and safety compared with systemic antibiotics. Ofloxacin is a safe alternative, and systemic antibiotics are reserved for complicated cases.

### Executive summary of clinical practice guideline on tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113JCGoJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This executive summary of the guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. The summary and guideline are intended for any clinician involved in managing children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or children being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting as an intervention for otitis media of any type. The target audience includes specialists, primary care clinicians, and allied health professionals.

Purpose

The purpose of this executive summary is to provide a succinct overview for clinicians of the key action statements (recommendations), summary tables, and patient decision aids from the update of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update)". The new guideline updates recommendations in the prior guideline from 2013 and provides clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. This summary is not intended to substitute for the full guideline, and clinicians are encouraged to read the full guideline before implementing the recommended actions.

Methods

The guideline on which this summary is based was developed using methods outlined in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence Into Action", which were followed explicitly. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, pediatrics, audiology, anesthesiology, family medicine, advanced practice nursing, speech-language pathology, and consumer advocacy.

Action Statements

Strong recommendations were made for the following key action statements: (14) Clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. (16) The surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude. Recommendations were made for the following key action statements: (1) Clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). (2) Clinicians should obtain a hearing evaluation if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion. (3) Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties. (5) Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. (6) Clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE) in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy. (7) Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral MEE at the time of assessment for tube candidacy. (8) Clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors. (10) The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. (12) In the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications. (13) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement. (15) Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. Options were offered from the following key action statements: (4) Clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) AND symptoms that are likely attributable, all or in part, to OME that include, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life. (9) Clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion for 3 months or longer. (11) Clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113gPn3q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. All these conditions are encompassed by the term otitis media (middle ear inflammation). This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. The guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or children being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting as an intervention for otitis media of any type. The target audience includes specialists, primary care clinicians, and allied health professionals.

Purpose

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline update is to reassess and update recommendations in the prior guideline from 2013 and to provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. In planning the content of the updated guideline, the guideline update group (GUG) affirmed and included all the original key action statements (KASs), based on external review and GUG assessment of the original recommendations. The guideline update was supplemented with new research evidence and expanded profiles that addressed quality improvement and implementation issues. The group also discussed and prioritized the need for new recommendations based on gaps in the initial guideline or new evidence that would warrant and support KASs. The GUG further sought to bring greater coherence to the guideline recommendations by displaying relationships in a new flowchart to facilitate clinical decision making. Last, knowledge gaps were identified to guide future research.

Methods

In developing this update, the methods outlined in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence Into Action" were followed explicitly. The GUG was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, pediatrics, audiology, anesthesiology, family medicine, advanced practice nursing, speech-language pathology, and consumer advocacy.

Action Statements

The GUG made strong recommendations for the following KASs: (14) clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea; (16) the surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude. The GUG made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (2) clinicians should obtain a hearing evaluation if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties; (5) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (6) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (8) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent acute otitis media or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (10) the clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube; (12) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (13) clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement; (15) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone in otitis media with tympanostomy tubes in pediatric patients: a randomized clinical trial [^112iqTm4]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in children commonly presents with otorrhea and negatively affects their daily activities.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution relative to ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, otic solution alone and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in the treatment of AOMT in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two twin multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with identical designs were conducted from June 24, 2011, through June 23, 2014, at ear, nose, and throat pediatric practices, general practices, hospitals, and clinical research centers. The study population comprised 662 children (331 in each trial) with AOMT in at least 1 ear who presented with moderate or severe purulent otorrhea for 3 weeks or less. Data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin alone, or fluocinolone alone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3 to 5 (undergoing therapy), 8 to 10 (end of therapy), and 18 to 22 (test of cure).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy measure was time to cessation of otorrhea. The principal secondary end point was sustained microbiological cure, defined as eradication or presumed eradication at end-of-therapy and test-of-cure visits.

Results

A total of 662 children participating in the 2 studies were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (n = 223), ciprofloxacin alone (n = 221), or fluocinolone alone (n = 218). The median age was 2.5 years (range, 0.6–12.7 years). The median time to cessation of otorrhea was 4.23 days (95% CI, 3.65–4.95 days) in patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with 6.95 days (95% CI, 5.66–8.20 days) in those receiving ciprofloxacin and not estimable findings in those receiving fluocinolone alone (P < .001). The clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit was 80.6% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 67.4% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 13.2%; 95% CI, 5.0%-21.4%; p = 0.002), and 47.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 33.0%; 95% CI, 24.0%-42.0%; P < .001). The sustained microbiological cure rate was 79.7% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group vs 67.7% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, 0.8%-23.0%; p = 0.04) and 37.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 42.1%; 95% CI, 29.3%-54.8%; P < .001). Only 7 (3.1%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 8 (3.6%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin, and 10 (4.7%) of the patients receiving fluocinolone presented with adverse events related to study medication.

Conclusions and Relevance

The combination of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone is more effective than treatment with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for AOMT, and it is safe and well tolerated in children.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone is superior to ciprofloxacin alone in pediatric patients with acute otitis media and otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^114aK8YY]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether topical administration of a corticosteroid improves resolution of acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea when combined with topical antibiotic drops.

Study Design

Randomized, patient-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical otic ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone versus topical ciprofloxacin alone in 201 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) of less than or equal to 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea.

Methods

Eligible patients were randomized to receive three drops of either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% into the affected ear or ears twice daily for 7 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 8 (end-of-therapy), and 14 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.

Results

The mean time to cessation of otorrhea in the microbiologically culture-positive patient population (n = 167) was significantly shorter with topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone than with ciprofloxacin alone (4.22 vs. 5.31 days; p = 0.004). This resulted in significantly better clinical responses on days 3 and 8 (P < .0001 and P = 0.0499, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in either the clinical response or the microbial eradication rate by day 14.

Conclusions

Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to treatment with ciprofloxacin alone and results in a faster clinical resolution in children with AOMT. The contribution of the corticosteroid in achieving a 20% reduction (1.1 day) in time to cessation of otorrhea is clinically meaningful and represents an important advance over single-agent antibiotic therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children [^114KL9Ev]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic eardrops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration; (2) clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who did not receive tympanostomy tubes until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms that are likely attributable to OME including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME).

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes [^1162V5CJ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Otorrhea occurs in 21 to 50% of all children with tympanostomy tubes in the United States. More than 1 million children annually undergo tubomyringotomy, constituting placement of more than 2 million tympanostomy tubes each year. The organisms typically responsible for otorrhea are the same as those that cause otitis media in very young children, including Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Drainage from tympanostomy tubes in older children involves organisms that colonize the external auditory canal, the most common being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Ofloxacin (Floxin otic), a newer fluoroquinalone antibiotic, has several advantages over other agents available for the treatment of otorrhea caused by acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes. The twice daily dosing regimen encourages better patient adherence to therapy, which is likely to improve treatment efficacy. Ofloxacin has not been associated with ototoxicity in animal models or in children participating in the clinical trials. It provides coverages for a wide range of pathogens, including Pseudomonas sp., and is indicated for use in children ≥ 1 year old and currently approved for patients ≥ 12 years with chronic suppurative otitis media. Ofloxacin applied topically in children with tympanostomy tubes in place and purulent otorrhea is as efficacious as oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) therapy. Other currently available therapeutic options are discussed.

### A trial of treatment for acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes [^116xDc79]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent guidance for the management of acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes is based on limited evidence from trials comparing oral antibiotic agents with topical antibiotics.

Methods

In this open-label, pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned 230 children, 1 to 10 years of age, who had acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea to receive hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops (76 children) or oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension (77) or to undergo initial observation (77). The primary outcome was the presence of otorrhea, as assessed otoscopically, 2 weeks after study-group assignment. Secondary outcomes were the duration of the initial otorrhea episode, the total number of days of otorrhea and the number of otorrhea recurrences during 6 months of follow-up, quality of life, complications, and treatment-related adverse events.

Results

Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation for all outcomes. At 2 weeks, 5% of children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops had otorrhea, as compared with 44% of those treated with oral antibiotics (risk difference, -39 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -51 to -26) and 55% of those treated with initial observation (risk difference, -49 percentage points; 95% CI, -62 to -37). The median duration of the initial episode of otorrhea was 4 days for children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops versus 5 days for those treated with oral antibiotics (P < 0.001) and 12 days for those who were assigned to initial observation (P < 0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were mild, and no complications of otitis media, including local cellulitis, perichondritis, mastoiditis, and intracranial complications, were reported at 2 weeks.

Conclusions

Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were more effective than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who had uncomplicated acute otorrhea. (Funded by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR1481.).

### Tympanostomy tubes or medical management for recurrent acute otitis media [^1133TgsQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Official recommendations differ regarding tympanostomy-tube placement for children with recurrent acute otitis media.

Methods

We randomly assigned children 6 to 35 months of age who had had at least three episodes of acute otitis media within 6 months, or at least four episodes within 12 months with at least one episode within the preceding 6 months, to either undergo tympanostomy-tube placement or receive medical management involving episodic antimicrobial treatment. The primary outcome was the mean number of episodes of acute otitis media per child-year (rate) during a 2-year period.

Results

In our main, intention-to-treat analysis, the rate (± SE) of episodes of acute otitis media per child-year during a 2-year period was 1.48 ± 0.08 in the tympanostomy-tube group and 1.56 ± 0.08 in the medical-management group (P = 0.66). Because 10% of the children in the tympanostomy-tube group did not undergo tympanostomy-tube placement and 16% of the children in the medical-management group underwent tympanostomy-tube placement at parental request, we conducted a per-protocol analysis, which gave corresponding episode rates of 1.47 ± 0.08 and 1.72 ± 0.11, respectively. Among secondary outcomes in the main analysis, results were mixed. Favoring tympanostomy-tube placement were the time to a first episode of acute otitis media, various episode-related clinical findings, and the percentage of children meeting specified criteria for treatment failure. Favoring medical management was children's cumulative number of days with otorrhea. Outcomes that did not show substantial differences included the frequency distribution of episodes of acute otitis media, the percentage of episodes considered to be severe, and antimicrobial resistance among respiratory isolates. Trial-related adverse events were limited to those included among the secondary outcomes of the trial.

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 35 months of age with recurrent acute otitis media, the rate of episodes of acute otitis media during a 2-year period was not significantly lower with tympanostomy-tube placement than with medical management.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute otorrhea through tympanostomy tube: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with daily follow-up [^116sjhqj]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of routine antimicrobial treatment of acute middle-ear infections is under debate, because the efficacy of antimicrobials in the resolution of middle-ear fluid has not been unambiguously proven. Acute tube otorrhea is regarded as evidence of acute otitis media, and for methodologic reasons it was chosen to provide objectivity for diagnostics and outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to assess whether amoxicillin-clavulanate accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in outpatient setting.

Patients

Volunteer sample of basically healthy 6- to 72-month-old children with a tympanostomy tube. Eligibility required having acute tube otorrhea of < 48 hours' of duration and no prior treatment within the last 2 weeks. The mean age of the participants was 25 months; they had a history of 3 episodes of acute otitis media (median), and 99% had manifestations of a concomitant respiratory infection. Of 79 randomized patients, 7 were withdrawn because of adverse events; 66 patients completed the study.

Interventions

Amoxicillin-clavulanate (N = 34; 45 mg/kg/d) or matching placebo (N = 32) for 7 days and daily suction of middle-ear fluid through tympanostomy tube.

Main Outcome Measures

Duration of acute tube otorrhea and duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

Results

The median duration of tube otorrhea was significantly shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (3 vs 8 days). At the end of the 7-day medication period, tube otorrhea was resolved in 28 of 34 children receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 13 of 32 children on placebo (treatment-control difference 41%; 95% confidence interval, 20%-63%; number needed to treat, 2.4). The median duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid was shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (1 vs 8 days).

Conclusions

Oral antibiotic treatment significantly accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea by reducing bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1132DX9C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with middle ear effusion (MEE): Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral MEE at the time of assessment for tube candidacy, with a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with minimal limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B, based on RCTs with minor limitations, and the level of confidence in evidence is Medium. Benefits include a mean decrease of approximately 3 episodes of AOM per year, ability to treat future episodes of AOM with topical antibiotics instead of systemic antibiotics, reduced pain with future AOM episodes, and improved hearing during AOM episodes, while risks are described as risks from anesthesia, sequelae of the indwelling tympanostomy tubes (otorrhea, granulation tissue, obstruction), complications after tube extrusion (myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, persistent perforation), tube medialization, procedural anxiety and discomfort, and direct procedural costs; overall, the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. The method of confirming the presence of MEE should be based on clinician experience and may include tympanometry, simple otoscopy, and/or pneumatic otoscopy, and there is a substantial role for shared decision making regarding the decision to proceed with or decline tympanostomy tube insertion. Bilateral insertion of tympanostomy tubes is recommended even if only unilateral effusion is present, because more than 70% of children have similar eustachian tube function on the both sides.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1176RR3Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) — tympanostomy tube evidence and guidance: Tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM decreased the average number of AOM episodes by about 2.5 per child-year in 2 RCTs; an RCT of children younger than 2 years reported a significant but modest reduction of 0.55 per child-year, and when otitis media with effusion (OME) lasts 2 months or longer, reductions of 0.20–0.72 per child-year are reported, whereas one trial in children with recurrent AOM but without MEE found no reduction. Additional benefits include decreased pain and the ability to manage AOM with topical antibiotic eardrops, and eardrops alone are highly effective for AOM with tubes; audiometric benefits are noted but are no longer present after 2 years. Clinicians should offer tympanostomy tubes to children with recurrent AOM and MEE with shared decisions with the child's caregiver, and a period of surveillance with reassessment at 3- to 6-month intervals can be used when there is uncertainty about surgery appropriateness.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114KJyqh]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Key Action Statement 5B — recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) — Clinicians may offer tympanostomy tubes for recurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes in 1 year, with 1 episode in the preceding 6 months). Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Option. Benefits include decreased frequency of AOM and ability to treat AOM with topical antibiotic therapy, risks include risks of anesthesia or surgery, cost, scarring of TM, chronic perforation, cholesteatoma, and otorrhea; the benefits-harms assessment is equilibrium of benefit and harm, patient preferences involve joint decision of parent and clinician, and exclusions include any contraindication to anesthesia and surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113uEBQr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) without middle ear effusion (MEE) — evidence and policy emphasize natural improvement without tubes and limited prophylactic benefit, with Policy level: Recommendation. In placebo arms of randomized trials, children entered with a mean baseline rate of 5.5 or more annual episodes but averaged only 2.8 annual episodes while on placebo, and 41% had no additional episodes for a median 6 months while 83% had only 2 or fewer episodes; individual episodes were treated with a 7- to 10-day course of oral antibiotic. Systematic reviews of tympanostomy tube insertion for recurrent AOM have shown a transient benefit of questionable clinical significance with no additional benefit when compared with antibiotic use, and an RCT specifically excluding baseline MEE found no benefit for reducing subsequent AOM, although tubes decreased the mean percentage time with otitis media over the next 2 years by about 8%, or 30 days per year. Another RCT reported significant benefits in children aged 10 months to 2 years, but it included children with persistent MEE with effusions aspirated during surgery. After watchful waiting in recurrent AOM without MEE at assessment, only 34% of 123 children proceeded to tube placement and about two-thirds were managed successfully without tympanostomy tube insertion. Exceptions noted include at-risk children, severe or persistent AOM, immunosuppression, prior complications of otitis media (mastoiditis, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis), or multiple antibiotic allergy or intolerance.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^111qJzSU]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of ≤ 3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%).

Results

Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen.

Conclusion

Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.

### Microbiology of acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes [^111VLurV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the types of organisms which cause acute otitis media with a tympanostomy tube and to ascertain their frequency distribution.

Study Design and Setting

Prospective, randomized, multi-institutional clinical trials. Both private and academic sites were included.

Results

1309 isolates were recovered from 956 draining ears. Streptococcus pneumonia was recovered from 17%, Staphylococcus aureus from 13%, H flu from 18% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 12%. Fungal organisms were recovered from 5% of total isolates and 4% from single isolates.

Conclusions

AOMT is microbiologically different than AOM with an intact TM. There is no evidence that resistance develops as result of topical treatment.

Significance

The study demonstrates that AOMT is frequently caused by organisms not susceptible to oral antibiotics approved for children, but which are sensitive to topical ear drops.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114D5nMV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Acute TTO — topical versus systemic antibiotic therapy: Four RCTs have compared topical antibiotic eardrops to systemic oral antibiotics for acute TTO in children, one additional RCT found no advantage to combination therapy, and clinical cure upon completion of therapy after 7 to 10 days ranged from 77% to 96% with topical therapy and from 30% to 67% with systemic antibiotic therapy; only topical drops approved for tympanostomy tubes should be prescribed to avoid potential ototoxicity from aminoglycoside-containing eardrops, caregivers should be advised to limit topical therapy to a simple course of no more than 10 days, and systemic quinolone antibiotics are not approved for children aged 14 years or younger whereas topical drops are approved because they are not absorbed systemically.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115ZEdUq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) in children — For uncomplicated acute TTO, clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, and this is a Strong recommendation. Acute refers to otorrhea of less than 4 weeks' duration, and uncomplicated refers to TTO that is not accompanied by high fever (38.5 °C, 101.3 °F), concurrent illness requiring systemic antibiotics, or cellulitis extending beyond the external ear canal to involve the pinna or adjacent skin; this recommendation does not apply to prophylactic administration of drops at the time of tube placement or prescription of drops for immediate use after tubes. Exceptions include children with complicated otorrhea, cellulitis of adjacent skin, or concurrent bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, or those who are immunocompromised; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a high level of confidence.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116PfbT7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

Objective

This study was a comparison of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

Methods

This was a randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension versus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in 80 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes of ≤ 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 drops of topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (Ciprodex Sterile Otic Suspension) into the affected ear(s) twice daily for 7 days or 600 mg of amoxicillin/42.9 mg of clavulanic acid oral suspension (Augmentin ES-600 Oral Suspension) every 12 hours for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 11 (end-of-therapy), and 18 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.

Results

The median time to cessation of otorrhea was significantly shorter with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension than with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension (4.0 vs 7.0 days; n = 79). This resulted in significantly more clinical cures at the test-of-cure visit (85% vs 59%, respectively). Frequent adverse events (> 3%) related to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension included ear pain (5.1%) and related to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension included diarrhea (19.5%), dermatitis (7.3%), and gastroenteritis (4.9%).

Conclusions

Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to treatment with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension and results in more clinical cures and earlier cessation of otorrhea with fewer adverse effects in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^116E8E4w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116Soora]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — strong recommendations (KAS 14, 16) include that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea, and that the surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our current findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial however was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1125UTaw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Post–tympanostomy tube insertion management — The guideline development group is advising against routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops following tube insertion, and intraoperative management may involve saline washout, a single application of antibiotic ear drops (with or without a steroid), or no treatment; children with active acute otitis media or purulent effusions at the time of tube insertion are excluded from this recommendation. Supporting data include that a review of nearly 600 patients from 3 RCTs did not find an increase in intraluminal occlusion in patients who did not receive ear drops, although antibiotic drops decreased the rate of postoperative tube obstruction by about 12% (number needed to treat of 8).

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Otitis media and tympanostomy tubes [^1176hnLE]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is an acute infection of the middle ear and, depending on the age of the child, the certainty of diagnosis, and the severity of symptoms, should be either observed closely or treated (with high-dose amoxicillin, if not allergic). Host-related risk factors such as age, sex, cleft palate, or genetic predisposition or environmental risk factors such as seasonality, day care attendance, or tobacco smoke exposure may contribute to recurrent AOM (RAOM) episodes. Tympanostomy tubes are recommended in children with RAOM and an abnormal ear examination at the time of the clinic evaluation.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^116c4UPX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canalthat can be acute (most common) or chronic. The estimated incidence of acute otitis externa (AOE) is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 of the general population, and it is a common infection treated by health care professionals.

Historically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as common causative pathogens. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with water exposure in the ear canal commonly noted. Patients with AOE present with otalgia, tenderness, diffuse ear canal edema, and otorrhea. In severe cases, symptoms may result in sleep disturbance and severe discomfort, leading to many health care visits.

In uncomplicated AOE, current guidelines recommend treatment with topical antimicrobial agents with or without anti-inflammatory drugs, risk factor avoidance, and pain management, when required. Topical antibiotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they can reach high local concentrations in the infected area, demonstrate a low risk of adverse events (AEs), and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance.

Topical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (neomycin and gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin), with cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Topical fluoroquinolones are not associated with ototoxic effects and are effective in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria (including P aeruginosa).

In AOE, the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotic treatment is believed to enhance the resolution of the inflammatory response and improve associated symptoms. Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, has already shown superiority vs ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of diffuse otitis externaand vs ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone for children with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMTs). This combination is currently approved to treat AOE and AOMTs in more than 50 countries outside the US and for AOMTs in the US and Canada. The present study was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, vs ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone to treat AOE.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113qYyU9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Topical ciprofloxacin is superior to topical saline and systemic antibiotics in the treatment of tympanostomy tube otorrhea in children: the results of a randomized clinical trial [^114QFZc3]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To compare the clinical failure rates among children with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes treated with topical or systemic antibiotics versus topical saline.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, controlled patient study.

Methods

A three-armed randomized clinical trial using topical ciprofloxacin or oral amoxicillin or topical saline. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as presence of otorrhea in at least one ear after 7 days of treatment.

Results

The treatment failure rates were 23% and 70% in the group treated with topical ciprofloxacin and oral amoxicillin, respectively. Treatment failures were seen in 58% of children treated with topical saline. Thus, topical ciprofloxacin significantly reduced treatment failures compared to both oral amoxicillin and topical saline. The most frequent bacteria isolated from treatment failures in general were streptococci and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Conclusions

The significant effect of topical ciprofloxacin is probably related to a higher local concentration of antibiotics in the middle ear rather than the result of mechanical rinsing and dissolution of the bacterial load.

### Effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes for otitis media: a meta-analysis [^116UfYtm]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Tympanostomy tube placement is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to synthesize evidence for the effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes in children with chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent acute otitis media.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in Medline, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.

Study Selection

Abstracts and full-text articles were independently screened by 2 investigators.

Data Extraction

A total of 147 articles were included. When feasible, random effects network meta-analyses were performed.

Results

Children with chronic otitis media with effusion treated with tympanostomy tubes compared with watchful waiting had a net decrease in mean hearing threshold of 9.1 dB (95% credible interval: -14.0 to -3.4) at 1 to 3 months and 0.0 (95% credible interval: -4.0 to 3.4) by 12 to 24 months. Children with recurrent acute otitis media may have fewer episodes after placement of tympanostomy tubes. Associated adverse events are poorly defined and reported.

Limitations

Sparse evidence is available, applicable only to otherwise healthy children.

Conclusions

Tympanostomy tubes improve hearing at 1 to 3 months compared with watchful waiting, with no evidence of benefit by 12 to 24 months. Children with recurrent acute otitis media may have fewer episodes after tympanostomy tube placement, but the evidence base is severely limited. The benefits of tympanostomy tubes must be weighed against a variety of associated adverse events.

### Overuse of tympanostomy tubes in New York metropolitan area: evidence from five hospital cohort [^116ffPg7]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The assessment of the use of tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media is not covered by clinical society guidelines, and the research evidence of efficacy is sparse. The explicit criteria developed by the panel of experts we convened generally indicate that tympanostomy tubes should be reserved for children with at least six episodes of recurrent acute otitis media in 12 months, who had had at least one infection that broke through antibiotic prophylaxis. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has fallen out of favour because of concerns about antibiotic resistance rather than controversy about its effectiveness. When we reanalysed the data, dropping the panel's requirement for a failure of antibiotic prophylaxis, a substantial majority still failed to meet the standard for sufficient frequency and were still considered inappropriate.

### Cost-effectiveness of management strategies in recurrent acute otitis media [^114isDoS]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tympanostomy tube placementvs nonsurgical medical management, with the option of tympanostomy tube placement in the event of treatment failure, in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM).

Study Design

A Markov decision model compared management strategies in children ages 6–35 months, using patient-level data from a recently completed, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of tympanostomy tube placement vs medical management. The model ran over a 2-year time horizon using a societal perspective. Probabilities, including risk of AOM symptoms, were derived from prospectively collected patient diaries. Costs and quality-of-life measures were derived from the literature. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and secondary analyses in predetermined low- and high-risk subgroups. The primary outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

Results

Tympanostomy tubes cost $989 more per child than medical management. Children managed with tympanostomy tubes gained 0.69 more quality-adjusted life-days than children managed medically, corresponding to $520 855 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were sensitive to the costs of oral antibiotics, missed work, special childcare, the societal cost of antibiotic resistance, and the quality of life associated with AOM. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, medical management was favored in 66% of model iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year. Medical management was preferred in secondary analyses of low- and high-risk subgroups.

Conclusions

For young children with recurrent AOM, the additional cost associated with tympanostomy tube placement outweighs the small improvement in quality of life. Medical management for these children is an economically reasonable strategy.

Trial Registration

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116NC9wy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 5 key action statements (KAS) for tympanostomy tubes in children specify the following actions: The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. Clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion. In the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications. Clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement. Clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### Ototoxicity of ototopical drops – an update [^113zxbeV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Various topical preparations are widely used for treating external otitis, acute otitis media with perforation, post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea, and chronic suppurative otitis media. Solutions and suspensions that enter the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane can reach the inner ear by crossing through the round window membrane. The safety of various components of otic solutions used in this way, particularly aminoglycosides, corticosteroids, solvents, and preservatives, has been questioned in light of their ototoxic potential. The authors' objective is to review the literature discussing the safety of commonly used classes of otic preparations in settings in which the constituents can access the middle and inner ear in high concentrations and discuss their clinical experience with ototoxicity and experience with medical-legal issues.

### Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea [^1163u7so]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea is a common problem that is treated by both primary care physicians and otolaryngologists. Physicians should take a logical approach to managing this condition in order to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance and to minimize healthcare expenditures. Once the diagnosis has been made, first-line therapy with fluoroquinolone drops, with or without suctioning, is preferred. If the condition does not resolve after a few days, suctioning is recommended and oral antimicrobial therapy can be initiated, depending on the clinical situation. Parenteral therapy is sometimes necessary for those very few patients who do not improve with oral and topical antimicrobial therapy and aggressive local care. The use of prophylactic drug therapy is controversial.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1173F3P5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Purpose of this section — if an antibiotic will be used for treatment of a child with AOM, the clinician must choose an antibiotic with a high likelihood of being effective against the most likely etiologic bacterial pathogens with considerations of cost, taste, convenience, and adverse effects, and this section proposes first- and second-line antibiotics that best meet these criteria while balancing potential benefits and harms.

### Prevention and treatment of tympanostomy tube otorrhea: a meta-analysis [^1123TBrh]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Children with tympanostomy tubes often develop ear discharge.

Objective

Synthesize evidence about the need for water precautions (ear plugs or swimming avoidance) and effectiveness of topical versus oral antibiotic treatment of otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes.

Data Sources

Searches in Medline, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica Database, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.

Study Selection

Abstracts and full-text articles independently screened by 2 investigators.

Data Extraction

25 articles were included.

Results

One randomized controlled trial (RCT) in children assigned to use ear plugs versus no precautions reported an odds ratio (OR) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.37–1.25) for > 1 episode of otorrhea. Another RCT reported an OR of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.29–1.76) for nonswimmers versus swimmers. Network meta-analyses suggest that, relative to oral antibiotics, topical antibiotic-glucocorticoid drops were more effective: OR 5.3 (95% credible interval, 1.2–27). The OR for antibiotic-only drops was 3.3 (95% credible interval, 0.74–16). Overall, the topical antibiotic-glucocorticoid and antibiotic-only preparations have the highest probabilities, 0.77 and 0.22 respectively, of being the most effective therapies.

Limitations

Sparse randomized evidence (2 RCTs) and high risk of bias for nonrandomized comparative studies evaluating water precautions. Otorrhea treatments include non-US Food and Drug Administration approved, off-label, and potentially ototoxic antibiotics.

Conclusions

No compelling evidence of a need for water precautions exists. Cure rates are higher for topical drops than oral antibiotics.

### Ciprofloxacin 0.3% / dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension for the topical treatment of ear infections: a review of the literature [^1139wMdZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/antiiflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116qe89H]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — topical therapy efficacy and bacteriologic outcomes — shows high clinical resolution across agents, as about 65% to 90% of patients had clinical resolution within 7 to 10 days, while a network meta-analysis reported superior clinical cure for topical quinolones versus antibiotic-steroid combinations (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.57) but the superiority of quinolones was no longer significant in the direct comparisons. For bacteriologic endpoints, nonquinolone therapy achieved 87% cure with an 8% absolute increase when a quinolone antibiotic is used, and the clinical significance of this modest effect (NNT of 12 patients) is noted; another meta-analysis reported higher bacteriologic cure with quinolones (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02).

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115ZcXLw]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Surgery for recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) — evidence and practice variation — The use of tympanostomy tubes for treatment of ear disease in general, and for AOM in particular, has been controversial, most published studies of surgical intervention for OM focus on children with persistent MEE with or without AOM, and the literature on surgery for recurrent AOM as defined here is scant; a survey reported 40% would "never", 30% would "sometimes", and 30% would "often or always" place tympanostomy tubes for a hypothetical 2-year-old child with frequent OM without persistent MEE or hearing loss, and tympanostomy tubes remain widely used in clinical practice for both OME and recurrent OM.

### Exploring the burden of paediatric acute otitis media with discharge in the UK: a qualitative study [^1158bAJq]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Our results demonstrate there is a significant financial and psychological impact on parents. Numerous healthcare appointments require parents to take time off work in addition to the travel expense. The psychological burden on parents has been shown when caring for chronic childhood illness but there is little evidence in recurrent acute disease such as AOMd. Another key problem identified in this disease context is the lack of patient information which contributes to parental anxiety. Limited medical information for AOMd likely prevents medical professionals from providing adequate counselling to parents. There is a need for patient, parent and professional-level information for AOMd.

Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global problem. The majority (72%–92%) of CYP with AOMd receive antibiotics despite there being minimal evidence for their effectiveness. Current NICE guidance within the UK recommends treatment with oral amoxicillin for CYP with AOMd. However, a recent study has shown that topical antibiotic treatment is more effective than oral antibiotics for tympanostomy tube otorrhoea. Clinicians from both primary care and emergency departments favour oral antibiotics. ENT doctors prefer topical antibiotics. Despite working in secondary care, ENT doctors also manage acute presentations of AOMd in follow-up and rapid access clinics, emergency departments and provide advice to other specialities. The difference in prescribing practice is likely multifactorial, reasons may include their familiarity and access to topical antibiotic drops. Treatment variation and antibiotic overuse were a key concern of parents, with CYP frequently receiving multiple courses of various types of antibiotics. Parental concern regarding antibiotic overuse in middle ear infections has also been reported in North America.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1145kg14]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children — research needs emphasize diagnostic prediction and testing strategies, including whether we can "identify clinical factors that predict persistence of MEE" and define "the ideal timing of audiologic testing for a child being considered for tubes — before surgery, after surgery, or both", and how "abnormal tympanometry at the initial clinical encounter" relates to persistence of otitis media with effusion (OME). Questions address evaluation and risk prediction in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), such as the "best time to evaluate children referred for possible surgical treatment of recurrent AOM with relation to the last episode of AOM" and whether the "presence of middle ear fluid in one or both ears" predicts more AOM episodes in children with recurrent AOM. For at‑risk populations, the guideline asks about the "benefits of tympanostomy tube placement on frequency of AOM, prevalence of OME, and speech and language development", whether surgery presents "unique risks or greater complications", the "actual frequency of AOM and prevalence of OME", and the potential for "underdiagnosis of OME because of attention to other conditions or overdiagnosis of OME because of greater clinical exposure for some of the at-risk populations". Indicators for repeated intervention are prioritized, including "the clinical indicators that best predict the need for repeated tympanostomy tube placement" and the "role of allergy testing" and management for children with "recurrent tube otorrhea" or repeated placement. Device and adjunct decisions are highlighted by asking whether certain "types of long-term tubes" are more often linked to complications and "which subgroups of children should be considered for adenoidectomy at the time of the first set of tubes or when younger than age 4 years". Communication and postoperative care topics include how "face-to-face" counseling and educational resources "facilitate shared surgical decision making", indications to prescribe "postoperative ototopical antibiotics", whether limiting routine drop use changes "the incidence of postoperative otorrhea" and microbiology, predictors of failure of "ototopical therapy as initial treatment for TTO", identifying children at risk for otorrhea and criteria for "posttympanostomy water precautions", whether child water‑precaution recommendations can be "generalized to adults with tympanostomy tubes", and the "ideal follow-up schedule" for patients with tubes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116KjAEU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative otorrhea prevention in children with tympanostomy tubes — saline washout versus antibiotic ear drops: The recommendation against prescribing relates to continuing use of antibiotic ear drops that may be prescribed for up to 10 days after surgery. Based on 2 low‑risk randomized controlled trials (RCTs), saline washouts reduced otorrhea incidence from 30% to 16% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.00) with a number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) of 7 children, while a single application of antibiotic‑steroid ear drops reduced otorrhea from 9% to 1% (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57) with an NNTB of 13. In a trial of 291 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) whose ears (N = 560) were randomized to four interventions — saline washout, oral amoxicillin for 7 days, oral amoxicillin for 7 days plus ciprofloxacin ear drops for 3 days, or observation — no significant differences in postoperative otorrhea were found, with rates ranging from 1.1% to 12.3%, supporting no added benefit from continuing antibiotic ear drops after surgery when compared with saline washout. A more recent RCT showed no benefit of routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops as compared with saline solution: Children (N = 174) were randomized to intraoperative ciprofloxacin or normal saline ear drops continued for 5 days after surgery; of the remaining 128 children, about 62% had recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 21% chronic OME, and 48% mucoid effusions, and there were no differences at 4 or 6 weeks in the incidence, duration, and QOL impact of early tympanostomy tube otorrhea or tube patency between groups.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1154pxem]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — recurrent disease and prevention research — indicates there have been adequate studies regarding prophylactic antibiotic use in recurrent AOM, whereas more and better controlled studies of tympanostomy tube placement would help determine its benefit versus harm. For prevention, there should be additional development of vaccines targeted at common organisms associated with AOM, and focused epidemiologic studies on the benefit of breastfeeding, specifically addressing AOM prevention, including duration of breastfeeding and partial versus exclusive breastfeeding, would clarify what is now a more general database; likewise, more focused studies of the effects of lifestyle changes would help clarify their effect on AOM.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116hkgwR]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME): Two found significant improvement in mean number of AOM episodes after tympanostomy tubes during a 6-month follow-up period, but one study that randomly assigned children and followed them for 2 years reported that although prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of AOM, no difference in number of episodes of AOM was noted between the tympanostomy tube group and placebo over 2 years. A Cochrane review analyzing 2 studies found that tympanostomy tubes reduced the number of episodes of AOM by 1.5 episodes in the 6 months after surgery, and tympanostomy tube insertion has been shown to improve disease-specific quality-of-life measures in children with OME. Regarding safety, a review reported no major complications in 10 000 tube insertions, with minor complications such as TM tears or displaced tubes seen in 0.16% of ears; a meta-analysis found tympanosclerosis in 32% of patients and chronic perforations in 2.2% of patients with short-term tubes and 16.6% of patients with long-term tubes. Adenoidectomy, without myringotomy and/or tympanostomy tubes, did not reduce the number of episodes of AOM when compared with chemoprophylaxis or placebo, and adenoidectomy alone should not be used for prevention of AOM but may have benefit when performed with placement of tympanostomy tubes or in children with previous tympanostomy tube placement in OME.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other ototopical preparations for chronic suppurative otitis media in children [^114vhk24]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of ototopical preparations, such as ofloxacin, in the treatment of CSOM in infants and children do not currently have approval by the FDA even though ofloxacin is FDA-approved for treatment of CSOM that occurs in adults. However, treatment with ofloxacin is FDA-approved when AOM occurs in children who have a tympanostomy tube in place, and effective treatment of this acute infection should prevent the subsequent development of CSOM.

### In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents [^1161Z7XV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection.

Methods

A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM.

Results

OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa

Conclusions

In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116yKq2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Draining ears and tympanostomy tubes: a survey of pediatric otolaryngologists and pediatric emergency medicine physicians [^117YHBFM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Posttympanostomy tube otorrhea also known as acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) occurs in 15% to 80% of children with tympanostomy tubes. Its management is fairly standardized among pediatric ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians owing to recommendations published by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Pediatric emergency medicine (EM) physicians have no such guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to compare management of AOMT by pediatric ENT and EM physicians.

Methods

A 27-question online survey was disseminated via SurveyMonkey.com using e-mail addresses of ENT and EM physicians via organization directories and professional listserves.

Results

A total of 175 and 174 responses were received from EM and ENT physicians, respectively. Higher proportion of EM physicians used oral antibiotics to treat AOMT (54% [n = 94] vs 9% [n = 16], P < 0.001). Virtually all ENT physicians used topical antibiotics, compared with 87% of EM physicians. Only 6% (n = 10) of EM physicians used suction to clean ear canals (aural toilet) before instilling topical antibiotics, compared with 81% (n = 138) of ENT physicians. Most ENT physicians (80% [n = 138]) instructed patients to keep the treated ear up for 10 to 60 seconds after instilling the drops and to use the tragal pump technique to direct the medication down the ear canal and through the tube (92% [n = 157]). Only 56% (n = 98) and 24% (n = 41) of EM physicians did the same.

Conclusions

There are large differences between ENT and EM physicians with respect to: the use of systemic antibiotics, techniques of using ototopical antibiotics, methods of aural toilet in treating AOMT, and directions given to patients.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^111WhMGT]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion found no benefit from intranasal steroids. However, the review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, risk ratio 1·99 [95% CI 1·14–3·49] for persistent otitis media with effusion at follow-up), and a non-significant point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, risk ratio 3·80 [95% CI 0·93–15·52]). Oral antibiotics alone were not effective.

Studies included in the systematic review were limited by short-term follow-up, low power, poorly described inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No previous cost-effectiveness studies of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. A non-placebo-controlled trial published subsequent to the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.

Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. We included more patients than the combined total number of participants included in previous studies of oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included hearing, tympanometric, and quality-of-life assessments at follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, language, and other functional outcomes compared with watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.

An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months. We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^112VmEqp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update) — introductory epidemiology and indications are summarized as follows: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. The tympanostomy tube, which is approximately 1/20th of an inch in width, is placed in the child's eardrum (tympanic membrane) to ventilate the middle ear space. Tubes were inserted into 667,000 children under the age of 15 years in 2006 (more than 20% of all ambulatory surgery in this age group), declining to 413,000 procedures in 2010; despite this decline, in 2014 about 9% of children under the age of 17 years had undergone tube surgery, and tubes were placed in 25% to 30% of children with frequent ear infections. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Otitis media (middle ear inflammation) is second in frequency only to acute upper respiratory infection as the most common illness diagnosed in children by health care professionals, and children younger than 7 years are at increased risk of otitis media because of their immature immune systems and poor function of the eustachian tube.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of granulation tissue in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^112yqGnV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Comparison of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension (CIP/DEX) to ofloxacin otic solution (OFL) for treatment of granulation tissue in children with AOMT.

Study Design

599 children aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years with AOMT of up to 3 weeks' duration were enrolled. Patients received either CIP/DEX 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or OFL 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Granulation tissue severity was graded at clinic visits on days 1, 3, 11, and 18.

Results

Granulation tissue was present in 90 of 599 AOMT patients (15.0%) at baseline. CIP/DEX treatment was superior to OFL for reduction of granulation tissue at the day 11 visit (81.3% compared with 56.1%, P = 0.0067) and the day 18 visit (91.7% compared with 73.2%, P = 0.0223). Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients.

Conclusion

CIP/DEX was superior to OFL in the treatment of granulation tissue in children with AOMT.

### Interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children [^1132BHY2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Grommets are frequently inserted in children's ears for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. A common complication is postoperative ear discharge (otorrhoea). A wide range of treatments are used to prevent the discharge, but there is no consensus on whether or not intervention is necessary nor which is the most effective intervention.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic interventions, both topical and systemic, in reducing the incidence of otorrhoea following the surgical insertion of grommets in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 3 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of prophylactic interventions against placebo/control and/or with other prophylactic interventions for postoperative otorrhoea in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The outcome data were dichotomous for all the included trials. We calculated individual and pooled risk ratios (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. We also calculated the numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB).

Main Results

We found 15 eligible RCTs (2476 children, aged from four months to 17 years). We graded seven RCTs as being at a low risk of bias (n = 926 children) and for an eighth RCT we also graded two of the arms as being at a low risk of bias. We graded the other seven trials as being at a high risk of bias. For a single application at surgery, there was evidence from two low risk of bias trials that at two weeks postoperatively the risk of otorrhoea was reduced by multiple saline washouts (from 30% to 16%; RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.00; NNTB 7; one RCT; 140 children) and antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 9% to 1%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57; NNTB 13; one RCT; 322 ears). A meta-analysis of two low risk of bias trials (222 ears) failed to find an effect of a single application of antibiotic/steroid ear drops at four to six weeks postoperatively. For a prolonged application of an intervention, there was evidence from four low risk of bias trials that the risk of otorrhoea was reduced two weeks postoperatively by antibiotic ear drops (from 15% to 8%; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97; NNTB 15; one RCT; 372 children), antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 3; one RCT; 200 children), aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops (from 15% to 5%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; NNTB 11; one RCT; 356 children) or oral antibacterial agents/steroids (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51; NNTB 3; one RCT; 77 children). Only one trial assessed the secondary outcome of ototoxicity, but no effect was found. There were no trials that assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found that each of the following were effective at reducing the rate of otorrhoea up to two weeks following surgery: (1) multiple saline washouts at surgery, (2) a single application of topical antibiotic/steroid drops at surgery, (3) a prolonged application of topical drops (namely antibiotic ear drops, antibiotic/steroid eardrops or aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops) and (4) a prolonged application of oral antibacterial agents/steroids. However, the rate of otorrhoea between RCTs varied greatly and the higher the rates of otorrhoea within a RCT, the smaller the NNTB for therapy. We conclude that if a surgeon has a high rate of postoperative otorrhoea in children then either saline irrigation or antibiotic ear drops at the time of surgery would significantly reduce that rate. If topical drops are chosen, it is suggested that to reduce the cost and potential for ototoxic damage this be a single application at the time of surgery and not prolonged thereafter.

### The evolution of ototopical therapy: from cumin to quinolones [^114ctX7D]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A radical change has occurred in the management of otorrhea over the past decade. Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and CSOM. For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base our treatment protocols for these conditions. We no longer must rely solely on our clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, their overall cost is lower than the alternatives, and their convenient dosing schedule is tolerated well by most patients. When one takes all these factors into consideration, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube. The development of ototopical medications has followed along the lines of Darwinian evolution, and the quinolone drops have clearly demonstrated the concept of "survival of the fittest".

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^112a4dvv]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary

Due to early termination of the trial non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics could not be determined in children with AOMd. In our small group of 58 children, we found that those assigned to eardrops had lower resolution rates of ear pain and fever at 3 days, longer parent-reported ear discharge, and slightly higher mean ear pain scores over days 1–3 compared to those receiving oral antibiotics, but received fewer oral antibiotic courses in three months and had less GI upset and rash.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first report on the comparative effectiveness evidence of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops versus oral antibiotics in children with AOMd. The pragmatic design of the trial and high rate of data completeness support the applicability of its findings to routine daily practice.

Some limitations deserve further attention. Accrual to our trial was affected by a temporary closure due to study medication supply issues. When this was resolved the COVID-19 pandemic complicated trial recruitment and accrual did not recover after the pandemic restrictions were lifted. This phenomenon has affected many trials worldwide. Further, our non-blinded design could potentially have introduced detection bias. However, detection bias is unlikely to have significantly impacted our findings since we compared two active treatments and — based on our parent panel input — parents do not have strong preferences for one over the other treatment. Also, a double-dummy design would have hampered the applicability of trial results to everyday practice.

We chose hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops because they are widely used in the Netherlands and France, do not contain a potentially ototoxic aminoglycoside, cover the most important pathogens involved in AOM, and have been proven effective in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. They are however not available in many countries. Despite the absence of evidence, we believe that any combination of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops with a similar antimicrobial profile, like a quinolone-containing eardrop plus dexamethasone, would have yielded comparable results.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112zH3x1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or with other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and one of a suite of seven reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one week of follow-up involving adults and children with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to placebo or no intervention, and compared to another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks and up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found one new study (100 participants). Overall, we included 18 studies with 1783 participants (in 16 studies), plus 108 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). 1. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One study (50 participants, data unavailable for 15 participants) compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Topical ciprofloxacin may increase resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with placebo (84% with antibiotic versus 12% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study authors reported "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected". 2. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies (438 participants) compared topical antibiotics versus no treatment, with oral antibiotics in both arms. These compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (3 studies, 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (1 study, 248 participants). In each study, all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin or injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study, all participants received aural toilet. There were no useable data comparing topical ceftizoxime to no treatment. Topical antibiotics in addition to systemic antibiotics may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with systemic antibiotics alone (resolution of discharge occurring in 88% with topical antibiotics versus 60% without topical antibiotics; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.88; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study (40 participants) stated "no side effect was recorded in any patient" (low-certainty evidence). 3. Comparisons of different topical antibiotics Eight studies (794 participants, plus 40 ears) compared aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycin, or tobramycin) with quinolones (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin). Resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks may be higher in the quinolones group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.67; 7 studies, 794 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was considerable heterogeneity (I² = 97%). One study (308 participants) stated there were no differences between the different groups for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on ear pain (1 study reported no differences between groups). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on hearing loss (2 studies reported no differences between groups). 4. Other comparisons We assessed five studies (501 participants, plus 68 ears) over the following three additional comparisons: quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B with/without gramicidin, aminoglycosides versus trimethoprim-sulphacetamide-polymixin B, and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol. However, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM because of the limited amount of low- or very low-certainty evidence available. This was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115oVoMb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Chronic bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) and hearing loss — Children "should be offered tympanostomy tube surgery", and clinicians fulfill the obligation of "offering" by documenting discussion of the unfavorable natural history that "will likely persist in most children even after 1 year of observation", the benefits and risks of tube insertion, alternatives limited to surveillance because medical therapy "is ineffective and not recommended", and the final shared decision, which may include surveillance at "3- to 6-month intervals" or further evaluation.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112nHFst]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of participants had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 17 studies with a total of 2198 participants. Twelve studies reported the sample size in terms of participants (not ears); these had a total of 1797 participants. The remaining five studies reported both the number of participants and ears, representing 401 participants, or 510 ears. A: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One small study compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Although ciprofloxacin was better than saline in terms of resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 84% versus 12% (risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants, very low-certainty evidence), the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other. The study authors reported that "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected" (very low-certainty evidence). B: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (three studies; 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (one study; 248 participants). In each study all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin, injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study all participants received aural toilet. Useable data were only available from the first three studies; ciprofloxacin was better than no treatment, resolution of discharge occurring in 88.2% versus 60% at one to two weeks (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80; 2 studies, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported ear pain or discomfort/local irritation. C: Comparisons of different topical antibiotics The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in these comparisons is very low. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides Seven studies compared an aminoglycoside (gentamicin, neomycin or tobramycin) with ciprofloxacin (734 participants) or ofloxacin (214 participants). Whilst resolution of discharge at one to two weeks was higher in the quinolones group the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.29; 6 studies, 694 participants). One study measured ear pain and reported no difference between the groups. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B combination ± gramicidin We identified three studies but data on our primary outcome were only available in one study. Comparing ciprofloxacin to a neomycin/polymyxin B/gramicidin combination, for an unknown treatment duration (likely four weeks), ciprofloxacin was better (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, 186 participants). A "few" patients experienced local irritation upon the first instillation of topical treatment (numbers/groups not stated). Others Other studies examined topical gentamicin versus a trimethoprim/sulphacetamide/polymixin B combination (91 participants) and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol (160 participants). Limited data were available and the findings were very uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-quality evidence available. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Cost-effectiveness of treatment of acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes [^114PRBoq]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otorrhea is a common problem in children with tympanostomy tubes. We recently demonstrated that treatment with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops is clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of these three common treatment strategies for this condition.

Methods

We performed an open-label pragmatic trial in which 230 children with acute uncomplicated tympanostomy-tube otorrhea were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 3 treatments: hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops, oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension, and initial observation (no assigned medication prescription to fill). Parents kept a daily diary capturing ear-related symptoms, health care resource use, and non-health care costs for 6 months. At 2 weeks and 6 months, the study doctor visited the children at home performing otoscopy. Using a societal perspective, treatment failure (otoscopic presence of otorrhea at 2 weeks) and number of days with otorrhea as reported in the daily diary were balanced against the costs.

Results

Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation both at 2 weeks and 6 months. At 2 weeks, mean total cost per patient was US$42.43 for antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops, US$70.60 for oral antibiotics, and US$82.03 for initial observation. At 6 months, mean total cost per patient was US$368.20, US$420.73, and US$640.44, respectively. Because of the dominance of eardrops, calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was redundant.

Conclusions

Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops are clinically superior and cost less than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who develop otorrhea.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112f1pT9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112KSmBB]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, older children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to ensure follow-up when observation is used as an initial strategy with the initiation of antibiotic therapy when the patient worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

### Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea: a meta-analysis [^111WMy7E]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tube placement. The incidence of this problem varies from 3.4% to 74%. Trials that study post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea may involve valid randomization "by patient" or "by ear". In an attempt to define "best practice", we conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the benefit of using topical prophylactic antibiotic drops in the postoperative period. We then compare our findings with previous results found in the literature.

Methods

We selected randomized studies for which antibiotic drops had been used for at least 48 hours after tympanostomy tube insertion. Nine studies, 3 "by ear" and 6 "by patient", met our inclusion criteria. The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each to conduct the meta-analysis.

Results

Overall, prophylaxis appears to be effective at reducing the incidence of post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The odds ratios for all studies were less than 1.0. However, none of the 3 "by ear" studies and only 3 of the 6 "by patient" studies were statistically significant. The mean odds ratio was 52%, suggesting that prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea by half.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggests that routine post-tympanostomy tube prophylaxis is beneficial, but this finding is dependent on selection criteria used.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111Cda28]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We were unable to determine non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics, but our findings in a small group of children, requiring confirmation, suggest that oral antibiotics may be more effective in resolving symptoms and shortening the duration of ear discharge than antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children with AOMd. That must be balanced against the findings that eardrops are associated with reasonable symptom control, fewer total oral antibiotic courses, and less systemic side effects in case there is non-inferiority. Since we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics in children with AOMd, current guidelines' recommendation that clinicians can consider oral antibiotics in this group of children are not unreasonable but must be balanced against the major public health threat of antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^113WD5Lw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic and steroid compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity.

Main Results

We included 17 studies addressing 11 treatment comparisons. A total of 1901 participants were included, with one study (40 ears) not reporting the number of participants recruited, which we therefore could not account for. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The main comparisons were: 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Resolution of discharge was not reported at between one to two weeks. One study (50 'high-risk' children) reported results at more than four weeks by ear and we could not adjust the results to by person. The study reported that 58% (of 41 ears) resolved with topical antibiotics compared with 50% (of 26 ears) with no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both the intervention and placebo groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study (123 participants) reported that no side effects occurred in any participants (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics (same antibiotics) only Four studies (475 participants) were included in this comparison. Three studies (340 participants) compared topical antibiotic-steroid combinations to topical antibiotics alone. The evidence suggests little or no difference in resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 82.7% versus 76.6% (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 335 participants; 3 studies (4 study arms); low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study (110 participants) reported local itchiness but as there was only one episode in each group it is uncertain whether there is a difference (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity but it was not possible to determine whether there were differences between the groups for this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported serious complications. 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids compared to topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Nine studies (981 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated a range of comparisons of topical non-quinolone antibiotic-steroid combinations versus topical quinolone antibiotics alone. Resolution of discharge may be greater with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at between one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics with steroids: 82.1% versus 63.2% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 7 studies; 903 participants, low-certainty evidence). Results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were not reported. One study (52 participants) reported usable data on ear pain, two studies (419 participants) reported hearing outcomes and one study (52 participants) reported balance problems. It was not possible to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups for these outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies (149 participants) reported no serious complications (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids in improving the resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-certainty evidence available. Amongst this uncertainty, we found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge. There is also low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic/steroid combinations in improving resolution of discharge. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.
