## Question

recommend me some brands of acne-prone suncreen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for brand recommendations and a step-by-step decision framework for selecting sunscreen for acne-prone skin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale for sunscreen in acne-prone skin and the role of retinoids. Then, I should verify the core selection criteria: non-comedogenicity, formulation, SPF/UVA coverage, and tolerability. Next, I will examine filter types and special considerations for skin of color, pregnancy, and medication interactions. After that, I will synthesize brand options by category and provide a concise recommendation summary. Finally, I will outline a practical application and reapplication strategy and close with a brief, clinically sound bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale so I don't jump to conclusions: acne-prone skin still requires daily broad-spectrum sunscreen because many acne therapies (retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics) increase photosensitivity, and UV exposure can worsen inflammation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially in skin of color, so consistent photoprotection is essential to both safety and outcomes [^116TGu5N] [^115CP9jW] [^114uEfvd].

> I need to check the core selection criteria next. Non-comedogenic and oil-free labeling are key to reduce follicular occlusion; lightweight, water- or gel-based vehicles are generally better tolerated on oily skin; SPF 30 or higher with broad-spectrum UVA/UVB coverage is the minimum, with many algorithms recommending SPF 50+ for maximal protection; fragrance-free and dye-free formulas reduce irritancy; and mineral filters may be preferred for sensitive or easily irritated skin, though modern chemical filters can also be well tolerated when formulated appropriately [^113bWG3Y] [^116xZe2M] [^111D7xZm] [^113frhW5].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "mineral equals better for acne" with "mineral equals non-comedogenic". I should verify that non-comedogenicity is a formulation claim, not an inherent property of mineral filters; mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) are often less irritating and can be anti-inflammatory, but they must still be non-comedogenic in the final product, whereas newer chemical filters can be formulated in lightweight, non-greasy vehicles that suit oily, acne-prone skin if tolerated.

> Next, I should review special considerations. For skin of color, tinted mineral sunscreens with iron oxide help mitigate white cast and provide visible light protection that reduces hyperpigmentation risk; however, shade ranges are often limited, so matching and cosmetic acceptability must be checked at the counter or via samples when possible [^116bVNom] [^116UaSqK] [^112RRsBv]. For pregnancy, physical blockers are generally preferred; for patients on topical retinoids or benzoyl peroxide, I need to ensure the sunscreen does not contain potentially irritating botanicals or high concentrations of alcohol and that layering is compatible with the medication regimen [^115qGETQ] [^111cm7qP].

> Let me consider mineral options first because they are often a safe starting point for sensitive, acne-prone skin. Cetaphil Sheer Mineral SPF 50 is fragrance-free, water-resistant, and labeled for sensitive skin with a microbiome-gentle claim; the DailyMed listing confirms mineral actives and directions for liberal application and reapplication, which aligns with best practices [^114cVBMt]. EltaMD UV Clear (SPF 46) is widely used in dermatology for acne-prone and rosacea-prone skin; it is mineral-chemical hybrid, oil-free, and contains niacinamide, which can be anti-inflammatory and helpful for acne and redness, though I should confirm patient-specific niacinamide tolerance before recommending [^116xZe2M]. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral SPF 50 offers a matte finish and is non-comedogenic; its tinted versions can improve blendability on darker skin tones, but I need to ensure the shade match is acceptable [^116bVNom] [^112RRsBv].

> Now, I will examine lightweight chemical options for those who prioritize cosmetic elegance and no white cast. Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30/55 is oil-free, non-comedogenic, and designed for acne-prone skin; its water-resistant formulations are practical for active patients, though I should remind users to reapply after sweating or swimming [^111D7xZm]. La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Fluid SPF 50+ provides very high UVA protection in an ultra-light fluid that layers well under makeup; however, I should confirm tolerability in very sensitive skin due to the chemical filter load [^notfound]. Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 is a popular clear, gel-like primer-sunscreen that works well for darker skin tones and oily skin, but I need to ensure it is labeled non-comedogenic and compatible with any prescription topicals being used [^notfound].

> Wait, I should double-check that I'm not overstating brand endorsements; I need to ensure I'm aligning with principles rather than marketing. The brands above are repeatedly cited in dermatology practice and reviews for acne-prone skin, but the key is to match filter type, vehicle, and cosmetic acceptability to the patient's skin type, tone, and regimen, and to verify that the chosen product is labeled non-comedogenic and broad-spectrum before recommending it [^116wx7zR] [^111D7xZm].

> I will now synthesize a concise recommendation set, keeping it clinically actionable. For sensitive or easily irritated acne-prone skin, mineral options like Cetaphil Sheer Mineral SPF 50 or EltaMD UV Clear are reasonable first-line choices; for oily skin prioritizing cosmetic elegance, lightweight chemical fluids such as La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 or Supergoop! Unseen can improve adherence; for skin of color, tinted mineral formulations with iron oxide (e.g., certain Anthelios Mineral shades) help address white cast and visible light concerns, with shade matching essential to acceptance and use [^114cVBMt] [^116xZe2M] [^116bVNom] [^112RRsBv].

> Next, I should review application technique and reapplication because real-world use often undermines labeled SPF. I need to ensure patients apply a generous amount (about a pea-sized amount per facial zone, totaling roughly 1/4 teaspoon for the full face) 15–30 minutes before sun exposure, then reapply every 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, or towel drying; early reapplication about 15–30 minutes after initial exposure can modestly improve protection under some conditions, though adherence to the 2-hour interval remains the most practical message [^111D7xZm] [^117Jr54S]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying indefinite durability; while some data suggest partial durability over 8 hours under controlled conditions, real-world factors like rubbing and sweat still justify routine reapplication to maintain protection [^114bF6Si].

> I need to ensure medication compatibility is addressed explicitly. With topical retinoids, skin is photosensitive, so daily broad-spectrum sunscreen is mandatory; patients should avoid harsh cleansers and potential irritants during initiation and titration, and use non-comedogenic moisturizers and sunscreens to mitigate irritation and barrier disruption, which can otherwise worsen acne temporarily [^115qGETQ] [^115bdPqf] [^113vSxWU]. If using benzoyl peroxide or other keratolytics, I should confirm that the sunscreen vehicle is not destabilized by peroxide and that layering is timed to minimize irritation, adjusting frequency as needed based on tolerability [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient reports stinging or new breakouts after starting a new sunscreen? I should double-check for potential irritants like fragrance, denatured alcohol, or botanical extracts, and consider switching to a purely mineral, fragrance-free formula; patch testing on the jawline for a few days can help identify sensitivities before full facial use, especially in those with a history of allergic contact dermatitis or rosacea overlap [^113frhW5] [^114BqXrh].

> Final check and bottom line: for acne-prone skin, prioritize non-comedogenic, oil-free, broad-spectrum SPF 30–50 products with lightweight vehicles; mineral options are often well tolerated and anti-inflammatory, while modern chemical fluids can offer superior cosmetic elegance and high UVA protection if tolerated; match tint and texture to skin tone to maximize adherence, and reinforce correct application and reapplication to realize the labeled protection in real life [^116xZe2M] [^111D7xZm] [^113bWG3Y] [^116bVNom].

For acne-prone skin, choose **non-comedogenic, oil-free, broad-spectrum sunscreens** with SPF 30–50 and lightweight, non-greasy textures [^111D7xZm] [^116wx7zR]. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are preferred for their low irritation and anti-inflammatory properties [^116xZe2M]; chemical options with avobenzone, octisalate, or octinoxate are acceptable if well tolerated [^116GLtAT]. Recommended brands include **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Dry Touch SPF 60**, EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46, Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30/55, CeraVe Ultra-Light Face Lotion SPF 30, and Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40. Avoid **comedogenic oils, fragrances, and alcohol**, and always reapply every 2 hours when outdoors [^111D7xZm].

## Key considerations for acne-prone skin

When selecting sunscreen for acne-prone skin, consider the following factors:

- **Non-comedogenic**: Products labeled non-comedogenic are less likely to clog pores and cause breakouts [^111r2TRh].

- **Oil-free**: Oil-free formulations help prevent excess oil production and reduce the risk of acne flare-ups [^notfound].

- **Broad-spectrum protection**: Ensure the sunscreen provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays to prevent sun damage and hyperpigmentation [^116GLtAT].

- **Lightweight texture**: Lightweight, gel-based, or fluid formulations are preferred to avoid a heavy or greasy feel on the skin [^116wx7zR].

- **Fragrance-free**: Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin and exacerbate acne, so fragrance-free formulations are recommended [^notfound].

## Ingredients to look for

When selecting sunscreen for acne-prone skin, look for the following beneficial ingredients:

- **Zinc oxide**: Provides broad-spectrum protection and has anti-inflammatory properties, making it suitable for acne-prone skin [^notfound].

- **Titanium dioxide**: Another mineral sunscreen ingredient that offers broad-spectrum protection without clogging pores [^113N34He].

- **Niacinamide**: Helps reduce inflammation and redness associated with acne [^116xZe2M].

- **Hyaluronic acid**: Provides hydration without adding oil, helping to maintain skin balance [^notfound].

---

## Ingredients to avoid

Certain ingredients may exacerbate acne and should be avoided:

- **Comedogenic oils**: Such as coconut oil, lanolin, and cocoa butter, which can clog pores and cause breakouts [^notfound].

- **Fragrances**: Can irritate sensitive skin and trigger acne flare-ups [^notfound].

- **Alcohol**: Can cause dryness and irritation, leading to increased oil production and breakouts [^112XhYqd].

---

## Application tips for acne-prone skin

To maximize the effectiveness of sunscreen and minimize the risk of breakouts, follow these application tips:

- **Cleanse thoroughly**: Before applying sunscreen, cleanse your face with a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser to remove excess oil and impurities [^113hK2hQ].

- **Apply generously**: Use the recommended amount of sunscreen (approximately a nickel-sized amount for the face) and apply evenly.

- **Reapply regularly**: Reapply sunscreen every two hours, especially if sweating or engaging in outdoor activities [^111D7xZm].

- **Layer with other skincare products**: Allow other skincare products, such as moisturizers or acne treatments, to absorb fully before applying sunscreen [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

For acne-prone skin, **select non-comedogenic, oil-free, broad-spectrum sunscreens** with SPF 30–50 and lightweight textures. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are preferred for their anti-inflammatory properties and low risk of irritation. Brands such as La Roche-Posay, EltaMD, Neutrogena, CeraVe, and Supergoop! offer excellent options tailored for acne-prone skin. Always reapply sunscreen every two hours and avoid ingredients that may exacerbate acne [^111D7xZm].

### Cleansing and moisturizing in acne patients [^116wx7zR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Affecting over 80% of adolescents, acne is a widespread condition with substantial negative physical and emotional effects, and significant societal cost. Cleansing the acne patient involves several considerations, including matching skin type to the right type of cleanser, optimal times and methods of cleansing, treating parts of the body other than the face, and patient perceptions of the cause and treatment of acne. Moisturizing prevents and alleviates skin irritation, soothing the skin by slowing the evaporation of water. Many liquid face cleansers also moisturize, which may be all that is needed for a patient with oily skin. Protection from sun and environmental damage is important for all patients. While sunscreens are often irritants, the best options for young, oily, acne-prone skin tend to have a water or light liquid base. Moisturizing sunscreens are appropriate for patients with dry, sun-damaged skin, as well as those who wear makeup, have other skin diseases, or are easily irritated by products. Overall, treating acne patients should include education in patient-friendly terms and promoting healthy daily skin care practices, including cleansing and protection against environmental damage.

### Topical dermocosmetics and acne vulgaris [^115AyWUX]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Acne is a highly common skin disease especially among teenagers. Modern acne treatments are based also on the use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens. In choosing the right cleanser, it is important to consider some aspects: the interaction between skin type and the cleanser, the optimal time and method of cleaning and the cosmetic perception of the patient. The aim of our review is to highlight the importance of choosing the most suitable topical dermocosmetics for the different skin types, as well as the most effective timing and method to combine dermocosmetics with the standard acne treatment. A search in literature for selected key words was performed using PubMed. Additional papers were identified based on author expertise. Treatment of acne patients should include education for proper daily skin hygiene, including protection from environmental damage. However, given the low number of clinical studies on cleansers, it is difficult to make reliable recommendations. The correct choice and use of topical dermocosmetics are fundamental in the management of acne patients. Daily use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens can reduce both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion counts and may be helpful for acne treatment if combined with specific drugs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115qGETQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Topical retinoids — retinoids are the core of topical therapy for acne because they are comedolytic, resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are antiinflammatory, but use may be limited by dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation, which can be mitigated by reduced frequency of application; some formulations of tretinoin are not photostable and should be applied in the evening, and tretinoin may be oxidized and inactivated by coadministration of BP, so it is recommended that the 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category C, while tazarotene is category X; data suggest that adapalene is better tolerated than multiple concentrations of tretinoin (based on older formulations), and overall, the limitations of existing studies prohibit direct efficacy comparisons of topical retinoids; topical retinoids have been associated with increased photosensitivity, and concurrent daily sunscreen can be used to reduce the risk of sunburn.

### Skincare ingredients recommended by cosmetic dermatologists: a Delphi consensus study [^116xZe2M]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is ambiguity regarding the topical cosmetic ingredients preferred for common skin complaints.

Objective

To determine which topical ingredients are frequently recommended by cosmetic dermatologists for fine lines and wrinkles, acne, redness, dark spots, large pores, dry skin, and oily skin.

Methods

Literature review to develop long list of ingredients. Reduced by expert panel to most salient ingredients. Two rounds of Delphi consensus survey with second expert panel of clinicians and teachers. Comparative literature review to summarize published evidence supporting each consensus ingredient.

Results

List of 318 ingredients reduced by a panel of 17 dermatologists to 83. Two Delphi rounds completed by 62 dermatologists at 43 centers. Consensus achieved for 23 ingredients, including the following: azelaic acid (acne, dark spots); benzoyl peroxide (acne, oily skin); glycolic acid (acne, dark spots); mineral sunscreen (fine lines and wrinkles, redness); niacinamide (redness, dark spots); retinoids (fine lines and wrinkles, acne, dark spots, large pores, oily skin); salicylic acid (acne, oily skin); vitamin C (fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots). Most consensus ingredients supported by level 1b or 2b evidence.

Limitations

Some ingredients based on expert opinion.

Conclusion

Consensus exists among expert cosmetic dermatologists regarding ingredients most useful for common dermatologic concerns.

### Cosmeceuticals in the pediatric population part I: a review of risks and available evidence [^111dDKvA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The rise in the use of cosmeceuticals among children and adolescents has created a new challenge for dermatologists, who are confronted with the task of advising young patients on the risks that these products can carry and the often questionable efficacy of these products. While some cosmeceuticals can be beneficial for this population when used correctly, such as broad-spectrum sunscreen or specific anti-acne agents, other products may not carry benefits for young skin and could even cause complications, particularly in young consumers who have skin conditions such as acne or atopic dermatitis. Many of the common ingredients in cosmeceutical products have had very limited (if any) studies conducted in pediatric populations, and much of the data regarding the efficacy claims and risks of these products must be inferred from studies in adult patients.

### International consensus on anti-aging dermocosmetics and skin care for clinical practice using the RAND / UCLA appropriateness method [^116bVNom]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective was to provide international recommendations on anti-aging dermocosmetics for clinical practice starting with essential ingredients for protection and repair before working up to advanced products for specific concerns.&nbsp; Methods: Seven international experts reviewed 8 hypothetical case scenarios covering different ages, skin issues (eg, sensitivity, acne, melasma), and exposure to exposome factors for both sexes and all Fitzpatrick skin types (FST). The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to obtain consensus. Seventeen key ingredients were rated on a scale from 1 (totally inappropriate) to 9 (totally appropriate). Statistical analysis, 2 meetings, and email discussions refined the recommendations.

Results

High-factor broad-spectrum sunscreen (ie, protects against ultraviolet [UV] A and B rays), niacinamide, and other topical antioxidants were recommended for all scenarios. Further discussions were required for other ingredients. Tinted sunscreen/iron oxide were recommended for all FST, although compliance may be sub-optimal for darker skin phototypes (IV-VI), if not cosmetically acceptable. Combining a facial foundation with broad-spectrum sunscreen was recommended for darker phototypes to obtain visible light protection closely matching diverse color tones. Retinols were not recommended as a first-line treatment for sensitive skin, especially FST V and VI, due to the risk of irritation. After ablative laser treatment, alpha hydroxy acids should be avoided or used with caution in FST IV to VI due to the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Conclusion

We describe a simple, practical tool for use in daily dermatology consultations for providing recommendations on anti-aging dermocosmetics to cover diverse and inclusive populations of patients, addressing all skin types and international needs.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(1):1337–1343.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7798.

### NECASA II: a practical algorithm integrating skincare in the management of adult female acne in the nordic European countries [^113bWG3Y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adult female acne presents challenges, including increased prevalence, distinct clinical manifestations, heightened skin sensitivity, treatment-related intolerance, and reduced treatment adherence. Integrating skincare into acne management is essential, particularly in Nordic European countries, where environmental factors influence skin physiology. The Nordic European Countries Acne Skincare Algorithm (NECASA) II algorithm serves as an evidence-based practical tool for clinicians in this region to select appropriate skincare based on individual patients' needs to optimize acne care for adult females.

Methods

Dermatologists from six Nordic European countries met to develop the NECASA II algorithm, which builds on the NECASA I framework. The advisors conducted a structured literature review and, combined with their clinical experience, established best practice recommendations for integrating skincare into adult female acne treatment regimens.

Results

The NECASA II algorithm recommends integrating skincare into adult female acne management based on acne severity, subtype, and patient characteristics. The panel concluded that all acne regimens should incorporate a physiologic pH cleanser, an emollient with humectants and lipids, and SPF 50+ sunscreen. Skincare monotherapy is recommended for mild acne, adjunctive skincare for moderate-to-severe acne, and maintenance skincare to prevent relapse following treatment.

Conclusions

Personalized skincare regimens, combined with prescription and nonprescription treatments, can mitigate adverse effects, improve treatment tolerance and adherence, and enhance overall outcomes.

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: a clinical review and implications for practice [^115CP9jW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

For patients with SOC, hyperpigmentation is one of the most prevalent and bothersome dermatologic conditions. Since acne is a common cause of hyperpigmentation, early and aggressive treatment of acne is essential. Topical retinoids are highly effective in treating acne and can also improve hyperpigmentation due to their anti-inflammatory properties. For patients with sensitive skin, the newer lotions may be less irritating than older retinoid formulations. Educating patients about how acne treatments work and how long they take to work (for both acne and hyperpigmentation) — along with clear directions for skin care (cleansing, moisturizing, and sunscreen) — can help manage their expectations and improve treatment outcomes.

### Tretinoin (tretinoin cream) [^111WzgAj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with Tretinoin Cream should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using Tretinoin Cream. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with Tretinoin Cream until your skin has recovered.

Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with Tretinoin Cream may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions.

Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of Tretinoin Cream and consult your physician.

There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with Tretinoin Cream developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to Tretinoin Cream or therapy was discontinued.

### The importance of understanding consumer preferences for dermatologist recommended skin cleansing and care products [^115rKcyu]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dermatologist recommendations of skin care products are critical to the management of compromised and healthy skin and appreciated by patients. Professionals must carefully weigh not only the safety and efficacy but also the aesthetics of products if they are to achieve the desired outcome of satisfied patients. This article elucidates the relevance of product sensory characteristics and consumer preferences, with specific focus on what appeals to men vs. women, those with self-perceived sensitive skin, and acne sufferers. Different product formats with novel aesthetics are also discussed. Dermatologists' recommendations are clearly essential to ensure that patients use the most appropriate products; however, sensorial aspects of products should be taken into consideration when making those recommendations, to help motivate continued adherence.

1.2 Anti‐Acne Agents

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic concerns among the pediatric population, affecting over 80% of adolescents. Acne‐targeting cosmeceuticals may be beneficial for an acne‐prone consumer. Acne can cause significant psychological distress, driving many pre‐teens and teens to seek relief, which may involve following social media influencers and buying products touting dramatic benefits. It is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about cosmeceutical products targeting acne in order to understand what their patients may be using aside from prescribed agents, and to optimally integrate prescription treatments into a regimen their patients will be compliant with and satisfied to use consistently. Common anti‐acne agents and their possible benefits and associated risks can be found in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Common anti‐acne agents in cosmeceuticals.

1.3 Sunscreen

Broad‐spectrum sunscreen is the most effective cosmeceutical for skin cancer prevention and prevention of skin aging signs. Sunscreen should be recommended to all children and adolescents. Broad‐spectrum sunscreen blocks both long‐wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA), thought to be the primary contributor to photoaging, and short‐wave ultraviolet radiation (UVB), considered to be the main contributor to sunburns and skin cancer. The continuous use of broad‐spectrum sunscreen has been shown in multiple studies to prevent and even reverse signs of photoaging in adults. There are several types of broad‐spectrum sunscreens including those with chemical blockers, mineral blockers, and those that are tinted to match skin tone. In the pediatric population, sunscreen serves a largely protective function in preventing acute sunburn and phototoxicity and thus the chronic effects that lead to photoaging and skin cancer. While many dermatologists might be wary of the overuse of cosmeceutical products by children, the increased interest in sunscreen in this population that has resulted from the popularity of the cosmeceutical industry may help reduce skin cancer rates.

Practical Approaches to Treating Acne and Hyperpigmentation in Patients with SOC

Patient Education

Hyperpigmentation is a leading cause for dermatology visits among patients with SOC. Patients may find hyperpigmentation to be more bothersome than acne lesions, which can lead to frustration if hyperpigmentation does not improve with treatment — even if the acne is resolved. Therefore, it is important to educate patients about their dermatologic conditions and manage their expectations about treatment. Some points for discussion with patients are listed below.
Acne-associated hyperpigmentation is due to inflammation from acne. It is important to treat the acne in order to prevent the development of more hyperpigmentation.
Topical retinoids are approved for the treatment of acne and can be used as monotherapy or in combination with non-retinoid treatments. They are effective in patients of all skin types and have also been shown to improve hyperpigmentation in patients with melanin-rich skin. These medications are ideal first-line therapies in patients with both acne and hyperpigmentation, unless contraindicated (e.g. during pregnancy).
Retinoids will likely improve acne symptoms first, which is important because acne lesions and scarring can contribute to the development or worsening of hyperpigmentation.
With continued retinoid use, improvements in hyperpigmentation can be expected. However, it is important to apply retinoids as prescribed (to avoid more irritation), practice good skin hygiene, and use sunscreen.
Treatment regimens may change over time, based on the patient's response to medication(s) and tolerability. Ongoing communication between patients and clinicians about symptom improvement and side effects is strongly encouraged.

### Tolerability of a skin care regimen formulated for acne-prone skin in children [^111JKjGq]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The epidemiology and demographic profile of acne vulgaris has evolved over the past several decades, with a noted earlier onset occurring in patients as young as 7 years of age. The combination of a foaming facial wash and a facial moisturizer with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 is an over-the-counter cleansing and moisturizing regimen for acne-prone skin that has been shown to be safe and tolerable in subjects 12 years of age and older.

Objectives

To assess the tolerability of this skin care regimen in children ages 7 to 11 years with acne-prone skin.

Methods

This was an open-label, single-center study that investigated the safety and tolerability of these products in subjects 7 to 11 years of age (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01909713). Subjects used the foaming wash twice daily and the SPF 30 moisturizer once daily. Subjects were assessed for cutaneous tolerability, and satisfaction at baseline and weeks 1 and 3.

Results

Thirty-five subjects enrolled and completed the study. The cutaneous tolerability score of most subjects was none when assessed by the investigator and subject or legally authorized representative at weeks 1 and 3. The products were well tolerated and a positive impression for cosmetic acceptability was reported for both products by the study population on the questionnaire.

Conclusions

This study supports the use of a skin care regimen comprising a wash and a moisturizer in acne-prone patients as young as 7 years old since these products were safe, well tolerated, and liked by subjects.

### Tretinoin (Retin-A) [^111Mpoeq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in RETIN-A, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing.

Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with RETIN-A should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using RETIN-A. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with RETIN-A until your skin has recovered.

Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with RETIN-A may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions.

### Erythromycin (spotex) [^1153PTGB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Use Spotex once in the morning and once in the evening, unless your doctor or pharmacist has told you otherwise.

Wash the affected areas with water or with a mild cleanser, and then thoroughly dry the affected areas and gently apply on a thin film of Spotex using the tips of your fingers. Don't forget to wash your hands afterwards.

The alcohol quickly evaporates and erythrornycin penetrates into your skin without leaving an unpleasant film, after you have used Spotex; screw the cap tightly on the tube.

How long you will have to use Spotex will depend on how quickly your acne improves. You may well use Spotex Gel for one month and then a lower strength product for one more month. Your doctor will decide which strength to prescribe for you.

It is recommended to use sunscreens over treated areas before sun exposure.

### Safety and efficacy of two anti-acne / anti-aging treatments in subjects with photodamaged skin and mild to moderate acne vulgaris [^1177Cnba]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although reliable prevalence data are not available, adult acne is thought to be somewhat common, and it is not unusual for patients to have acne as well as early signs of skin aging. A novel anti-acne/anti-aging formulation (Treatment A) has been developed for daily use by patients to address both signs of skin aging and facial acne vulgaris. The novel, non-prescription formulation includes several ingredients shown to target factors underlying the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris while also addressing multiple components in the pathophysiology of skin aging.

Methods

A blinded, randomized, split-face study was conducted to evaluate and compare the tolerability and efficacy of the novel anti-acne/ anti-aging product in subjects with photodamaged skin and acne vulgaris relative to tretinoin cream 0.025% (Treatment B). All subjects also were given supportive skincare, consisting of a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Each treatment was assessed for its effects on subjects' appearance, lesion count reductions, and tolerability.

Results

Treatment A produced statistically significantly greater improvements in skin tone evenness, skin tone clarity, and blemishes and blotchiness. There were also statistically greater reductions in total lesion count for acne patients on the side of the face treated with Treatment A compared to Treatment B; Treatment A was also associated with early (day 2) improvement in skin tone evenness and clarity, tactile skin smoothness, and blemishes and blotchiness. Both treatments demonstrated favorable tolerability.

Conclusion

The novel topical anti-aging/anti-acne therapy (Treatment A) within a comprehensive skin care regimen of cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen may maximize efficacy and tolerability and contribute to our armamentarium for treating both photodamage and acne at the same time.

### Tretinoin [^116YhviQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing.

Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin gel should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin gel. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin gel until your skin has recovered.

Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin gel may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions.

### Effective with minimal side effects: a novel treatment regimen for acne vulgaris using multifunctional ingredients [^114UcdWi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There are numerous over-the-counter products for treating acne, although many formulations have tolerability issues and lack the cosmetic elegance desired by adult patients.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a non-prescription, active acne regimen in adult patients of all Fitzpatrick skin types.

Method

Thirty-five male and female subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI were enrolled in this single-site, monadic 8-week study. The acne treatment regimen included a clarifying cleanser, balancing serum, and broad-spectrum sunscreen formulated with synergistic ingredients designed to mitigate acne and reduce post-acne sequelae including post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and post-inflammatory erythema (PIE).

Results

After 8 weeks of use, there was a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory lesions by 63%, non-inflammatory lesions by 41% and investigator global assessment by 51%. Additionally, there was significant improvement in tactile smoothness, visual smoothness, skin softness, and luminosity. Post-acne sequelae including PIH and PIE improved significantly by 27%. No tolerability issues were identified by the investigator and subjects gave the regimen an excellent tolerability rating. 78.5% of subjects agreed that, after 8 weeks of product use, their skin appeared more radiant and looked better than before starting the study.

Conclusion

In this study, a well formulated, cosmetically elegant active acne regimen was found to be highly effective and well tolerated when used by adult acne patients of diverse ethnicities. In addition, the regimen improved cosmetic aspects of the skin including PIH and PIE, which are important when treating adult acne sufferers.

### Sun-safety understanding among Canadian elementary students: a survey-based cohort study across racial / ethnic groups [^116UaSqK]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous students in our study reported the greatest difficulty with regular sunscreen use, aligning with prior research demonstrating lower sunscreen use among these populations across both pediatric and adult groups. This may reflect disparities in sun‐safety practices within the home environment, as studies have highlighted the importance of parental modeling and guidance in promoting photoprotective behaviors. Adults are important role models to children and often play a crucial role in setting up resources, such as purchasing and applying sunscreen or dressing children in protective clothing. Evidence supports that skin cancer prevention can be more effective when families adopt photoprotective behaviors together.

Although sunburn and sunscreen usage rates are lower among Black individuals, darker skin remains susceptible to UV‐induced damage and sequelae of excessive UV exposure such as hyperpigmentation and acne. A UK‐based survey attributed this trend in part to the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in Western sunscreen advertising, as well as ongoing uncertainty within medical communities regarding sun protection recommendations for Black individuals. Additionally, formulation concerns may contribute to reduced sunscreen use, as many products leave a visible white residue on darker skin. While tinted sunscreens help minimize white residue, they are often limited in shade selection, failing to adequately accommodate a diverse range of skin tones. This urges more research to be conducted in exploring the correlation between UVR and skin cancer in skin of color populations, as well as the development of sunscreen formulations that better cater to diverse skin tones and improve cosmetic acceptability.

### Acne information on instagram: quality of content and the role of dermatologists on social media [^111tdZLF]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

While it is evident that many patients turn to social media for information about skin care, the quality and content of available information are not well characterized. In this study, we investigated acne-related information available on Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms. We searched for the &ldquo; top&rdquo; Instagram posts using the hashtag #acne and characterized them based on their source and content. Posts were excluded if they were unrelated, not in English, or duplicates. 900 posts were assessed, and 439 were included. A majority of the content (258 posts) was generated by influencers, followed by retailers (97) and non-dermatologist providers (67). Dermatologists were responsible for 17 posts, accounting for < 4% of the included content. 124 separate ingredients were mentioned as potential acne treatments. The ingredients with the most mention were beta-hydroxy acids (eg, salicylic acid), alpha-hydroxy acids (eg, glycolic acid), vitamin C, niacinamide, and sunscreen. 254 posts recommended at least one specific intervention, and among these posts only 11% referenced a treatment with grade A evidence based on American Academy of Dermatology guidelines. A vast amount of content is readily available to patients on this platform. This content is heterogeneous in message and quality, and dermatologists are responsible for only a small portion of it.

### Tretinoin (tretinoin cream) [^111r2TRh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying Tretinoin Cream. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne.

HOW TO USE TRETINOIN CREAM

To get the best results with Tretinoin Cream therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when Tretinoin Cream is used properly, many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS – BE PATIENT – DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN – IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR.

To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind.

Apply Tretinoin Cream once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying Tretinoin Cream every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation.
It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results.
Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying.
Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin.
It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash.

### Sunscreens: misconceptions and misinformation [^111MsPUg]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past 70 years, sunscreens have evolved from beach products designed to prevent sunburn to more cosmetically elegant skincare products intended to protect against multiple long-term adverse consequences of characteristically low-intensity daily UV and visible light exposure. Sunscreen testing and labeling intended to quantify such protection are unfortunately often misunderstood by users and have also led to illegal misleading and potentially dangerous industry practices. Changes in regulatory requirements, better policing, and more informative sunscreen labeling would benefit users and their physician advisors.

### Tazarotene [^115jWQHS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Apply a thin layer of tazarotene cream only to the affected area once daily in the evening. (2.1, 2.2)
Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. (2.2)
If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. (2.2)

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Tazarotene cream is for topical use only. Tazarotene cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Wash hands thoroughly after application.

2.2 Psoriasis

It is recommended that treatment starts with tazarotene cream, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm²) of tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of tazarotene cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene cream to these areas should be carefully avoided.

2.3 Acne

Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm²) of tazarotene cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area.

Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using tazarotene cream [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^115uHKEe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

Papulopustular (acneiform) rash — preventive and reactive management: Based on the high frequency of rash and presentation within the first 2–4 weeks of therapy, preventive/prophylactic management is recommended unless there are contraindications based on patient and/or health care provider factors. A recommended prophylactic regimen is hydrocortisone 1% combined with moisturizer, sunscreen, and doxycycline 100 mg bid for the first 6 weeks; another study found prophylactic minocycline 100 mg daily effective in reducing lesions during the first 8 weeks, with doxycycline having a more favorable safety profile and minocycline being less photosensitizing. For reactive care, reactive use of medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids is recommended; vitamin K3 is being investigated while vitamin K1 reports lack control groups; and consistent reports of isotretinoin at doses lower than those used for acne support the recommendation of their use when other measures have failed. The rash peaks in weeks 4–6 after EGFRI initiation and decreases in severity after weeks 6–8, and active management should be considered throughout EGFRI treatment and follow-up to minimize late effects.

### Tretinoin [^112XhYqd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin.

Tretinoin gel acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition.

Drug Interactions

Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin gel. It also is advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin gel is begun.

### Racial / ethnic variations in acne: implications for treatment and skin care recommendations for acne patients with skin of color [^112uEvuk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is among the most common dermatologic diagnoses observed, including skin color (SOC) populations. This project sought to help clarify the existing published data and provide consensus statements on acne presentation, prevention, treatment, and maintenance in SOC populations to help improve patient outcomes.

Methods

Six SOC dermatologists convened for a virtual meeting and used a modified Delphi process to address: 1) Are there racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation and sequela of acne? 2) Are there racial/ethnic differences in the therapeutic endpoint of acne treatment and patient expectations? 3) Is there a need for specialized approaches to therapeutic options and skincare in acne patients with SOC? The results of a literature review and the outcome of discussions, coupled with the panel's expert opinion and experience, are intended for health care providers caring for acne patients and clinician-researchers.

Results

Racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation, sequelae, and desired treatment outcomes for acne have been reported. Notwithstanding limitations in the number, size, and methodologies of studies to date, the available data suggest that strategies that improve outcomes in acne patients with SOC include: Early initiation and maintenance of treatment regimens and careful consideration of tolerability of active ingredients, vehicles, and dosing. Using pH-balanced, non-irritating cleansers and non-comedogenic ceramides containing moisturizers help minimize irritation or dryness.

Conclusions

There a need for specialized approaches to therapeutic options and skincare in acne patients with SOC. OTC skincare products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

### Results of the non-small cell lung cancer part of a phase III, open-label, randomized trial evaluating topical corticosteroid therapy for facial acneiform dermatitis induced by EGFR inhibitors: stepwise rank down from potent corticosteroid (FAEISS study, NCCH-1512) [^111oopYS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

However, since the start time of antibiotic treatment (doxycycline/minocycline) in these trials was also different between the reactive and preemptive treatment groups, it was unclear if prophylactic use of topical steroids was itself beneficial. Moreover, since the application site for topical steroids is mainly on the face, the skin on the face may become thin following long-term use, and steroid acne may be induced. This is potentially an issue during longer term prophylactic administration of topical steroids. Indeed, the use of prophylactic topical steroids is rarely recommended by physicians.

Therefore, in the present study, unlike in the STEPP and J-STEPP trials, prophylactic treatment was initiated by administering oral minocycline and moisturizer at the start of EGFR inhibitors. While preemptive therapy for CRC patients is a standard treatment in Japan, this is not usually the case for NSCLC patients. Although prophylactical sunscreen was used in the STEPP and J-STEPP studies, prophylactical sunscreen was not used in the present study. This was because Japanese individuals normally require less UV protection than individuals of lighter-skinned races.

Five classes of topical steroid are marketed in Japan based on their anti-inflammatory potency: weak (e.g. prednisolone, 0.5%); medium (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate); strong (e.g. betamethasone valerate); very strong (e.g. diflucortolone valerate); and strongest (e.g. clobetasol propionate). Kiyohara et al. recommended that strong or very strong topical corticosteroids be used for Japanese patients in the event of acneiform rash; in severe cases (grade 2/3), the strongest class of topical corticosteroids should be applied twice daily. Once symptoms have improved, the patient should be switched to a medium-class steroid. If symptoms become worse, the patient should be switched to stronger class steroids.

### Sunscreen use: controversies, challenges and regulatory aspects [^116bw85b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Mismatches between skin pigmentation and modern lifestyle continue to challenge our naked skin. One of our responses to these challenges is the development and use of sunscreens. The management of sunscreens has to balance their protective effect against erythema, photocarcinogenesis and photoageing owing to the potential toxicity of the ultraviolet (UV) filters for humans and the environment. The protection against UV radiation offered by sunscreens was recently standardized in the European Union (EU) based on international harmonization of measurement techniques. Four different categories of sun protection have been implemented along with recommendations on how to use sunscreen products in order to obtain the labelled protection. The UV filters in sunscreens have long been authorized for use by the EU authority on the basis of data from studies on acute toxicity, subchronic and chronic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, photogenotoxicity, carcinogenicity, irritation, sensitization, phototoxicity and photosensitization as well as on environmental aspects. New challenges with respect to the safety of UV filters have arisen from the banning of animal experiments for the development of cosmetics. Future debates on sunscreens are likely to focus on nanoparticles and environmental issues, along with motivation campaigns to persuade consumers to protect their skin. However, more efficient sunscreen use will also continue to raise questions on the benefit in preventing vitamin D synthesis in the skin induced by sunlight.

### Management of acne in pregnancy [^116TGu5N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne is one of the most common dermatological conditions to affect women of childbearing age, so it is important to consider the safety of long-term acne treatments on women who could become pregnant. In this review article, we clarify what management options are available to treat acne during pregnancy. Topical treatments, typically first-line for acne, such as azelaic acid, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, dapsone, and retinoids, were reviewed. Systemic treatments, such as zinc supplements, cephalexin, cefadroxil, amoxicillin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and corticosteroids, typically second-line for acne, were also reviewed. Alternative treatments such as light therapy and cosmetic procedures were also evaluated. Due to recommendation of sunscreen utilization during acne treatments, sunscreen usage during pregnancy was also assessed. Management of acne during unplanned pregnancy was discussed in further detail regarding safety and adverse effects. Through summarized tables and examples of studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of treatments, the following is a resource for providers and patients to utilize for management of acne during pregnancy.

RETIN-A (tretinoin) acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition.

Drug Interactions

Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with RETIN-A. It also is advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of RETIN-A is begun.

### Comparison of characteristics influencing patient selection of sunscreen between urban and rural regions in the United States [^114BVdGe]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sunscreen greatly reduces the risk of skin cancer and is recommended as a critical component of sun protection. There is limited literature on patient preferences for sunscreen characteristics. A cross-sectional survey was administered to patients in an urban city and rural area in the United States. Sun Protection Factor (SPF) was consistently the most important factor for patients when selecting sunscreen. However, numerous preferences for sunscreen characteristics vary between the 2 regions, including dermatologist recommendation, texture, ingredients, cost, broad-spectrum, and brand. Gaps in patient knowledge of sunscreen recommendations may be present and further educational programs may be necessary. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(8):e171-e172. doi:10.36849/JDD.8449.

### When should sunscreen be reapplied? [^117Jr54S]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A common recommendation by many public health agencies is to reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours. Is this recommendation effective in minimizing ultraviolet exposure of the skin during time in the sun?

Objective

The purpose of this article is to determine how the time of sunscreen reapplication affects the solar ultraviolet exposure of the skin.

Methods

A mathematical model was derived that took into account typical amounts of sunscreen application and sunscreen substantivity to determine how these factors, when combined with the time of sunscreen reapplication, influence the photoprotection provided by sunscreen during exposure for several hours around mid day in strong sunshine.

Results

Using a sunscreen that is readily removed from the skin achieves little in the way of sun protection, no matter when it is reapplied. For sunscreens that bind moderately or well to skin, typical of modern waterproof or water-resistant products, the lowest skin exposure results from early reapplication into the sun exposure period, and not at 2 to 3 hours, after initial application. Typically reapplication of sunscreen at 20 minutes results in 60% to 85% of the ultraviolet exposure that would be received if sunscreen were reapplied at 2 hours.

Conclusions

Advice given to sunscreen users should be to apply sunscreen liberally to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun, followed by reapplication of sunscreen to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes after sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary after vigorous activity that could remove sunscreen, such as swimming, toweling, or excessive sweating and rubbing.

### Supplement article: skin barrier deficiency in rosacea: an algorithm integrating OTC skincare products into treatment regimens [^115dQh4F]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rosacea is a chronic condition involving inflammation leading to a diminished skin barrier function in sebaceous gland-rich facial skin. The current algorithm represents part II of a series investigating similar topics associated with preventing, treating, and maintaining rosacea, including ceramides-containing skincare.

Methods

The consensus process consisted of a modified Delphi technique. A previously published review by the US Cutaneous Rosacea Outcomes (USCRO) group on skin barrier deficiency in rosacea and the integration of over-the-counter (OTC) products and skincare recommended for rosacea treatment and maintenance informed the development of the current algorithm. The selected information from the literature searches, coupled with the USCRO group's opinion and experience, was used to develop, discuss, and reach a consensus on an evidence-based clinical treatment and maintenance algorithm focusing on rosacea phenotypes.

Results

The algorithm includes foundational measures to be taken by all patients with rosacea and rosacea-prone skin. These measures include education, behavioral modifications, avoidance of triggers and skin irritants, preventative skincare, and sun avoidance and sunscreen use. The algorithm further describes how assessment of skin condition and grading of cutaneous rosacea should take place during treatment and maintenance while the preventative measures continue.

Conclusions

Prescription medications combined with gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen support a successful rosacea therapy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21:9(Suppl 1):s3–10.

### Are in-market control systems for sunscreens adequate for consumer protection? A review of the legal framework regulating sun protection factor labels in Europe [^112tQKkF]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has long been known to have detrimental effects to human health, including skin cancer, photoaging and worsening photosensitive dermatoses. In order to tackle this modifiable risk factor, public health efforts and educational campaigns promote a variety of sun protection measures, such as avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, using cover clothing and applying sunscreen.

In the case of sunscreens, since there is a recognition that the actual protection afforded by sunscreens in real-world settings is less than that determined in laboratory tests, guidelines emphasise the importance of applying sunscreen regularly, in sufficient amounts and adequately. Among the different features that characterise sunscreens (eg, texture, type of UV filters, waterproofness), the sun protection factor (SPF) has emerged as the most familiar metric to sunscreen users. The SPF value, which is determined in a laboratory setting following standardised testing procedures, is also relied on by the medical and public health communities to produce guidelines and make recommendations.

Besides public health efforts, the regulation of the SPF labels displayed on sunscreen products allows the public to make safe and informed choices about sunscreens. Conformity with these regulations is monitored and enforced through in-market control systems that recurrently identify and bring into compliance commercialised sunscreens that have mislabelled SPF values. Yet as seen by the sheer number of sunscreens with mislabelled SPFs reported in the press, often leading to legal disputes, these cases seem too common, affecting users, regulators and manufacturersaround the world.

This compliance enforcement task can be challenging when the tests that have been used to label the SPF of the product are methodologically correct, and the only reason for questioning the labelled value is the different SPF result of another methodologically correct test. In these cases, a decision has to be made on whether test results are sufficiently different as to require relabelling or recalling the product or not. The consequences from these decisions go from economical and reputational damages to the manufacturer if the product is recalled from the market, to being perceived as unethical and against the interests of public health if otherwise. Either way, though, the message permeating the public, which is often amplified in the media, does not contribute to building confidence in sunscreens.

### South-east Asia study alliance guidelines on the management of acne vulgaris in south-east Asian patients [^116t5ATM]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of acne in South-East Asia is unique, as Asian skin and local variables require a clinical approach unlike that utilized in other parts of the world. There are different treatment guidelines per country in the region, and a group of leading dermatologists from these countries convened to review these guidelines, discuss current practices and recent advances, and formulate consensus guidelines to harmonize the management of acne vulgaris in the region. Emphasis has been placed on formulating recommendations to impede the development of antibiotic resistance in Propionibacterium acnes. The group adopted the Acne Consensus Conference system for grading acne severity. The group recommends that patients may be treated with topical medications including retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), salicylic acid, a combination of retinoid and BPO, or a combination of retinoids and BPO with or without antibiotics for mild acne; topical retinoid with topical BPO and a oral antibiotic for moderate acne; and oral isotretinoin if the patient fails first-line treatment (a 6- or 8-week trial of combined oral antibiotics and topical retinoids with BPO) for severe acne. Maintenance acne treatment using topical retinoids with or without BPO is recommended. To prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy or used simultaneously with oral antibiotics. Skin care, comprised of cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection, is likewise recommended. Patient education and good communication is recommended to improve adherence, and advice should be given about the characteristics of the skin care products patients should use.

### Choosing the right partner: complementing prescription acne medication with over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers [^113vSxWU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is the most common dermatological disorder. An impaired barrier function in acne vulgaris has been reported, as well as decreased amounts of epidermal ceramides. Also, many of the systemic and topical medications prescribed for the treatment of acne exacerbate these skin barrier disruptions and can lead to irritation and dry skin conditions.

Aim

The review explored the importance of maximizing adjunctive skincare, such as over-the-counter products for managing acne and avoiding adverse effects.

Methods

A literature review was conducted and included clinical acne guidelines, clinical studies, and review articles on acne prevention, treatment, and maintenance. Searches were made in PubMed and Google Scholar for English-language literature published between Jan 1, 2010, and Apr 1, 2020. Two clinicians manually reviewed selected publications.

Results

Seventy-four articles were included in the analyses. A variety of specialized cleansers and moisturizers are available as suitable adjunctive therapies for acne-prone skin. Lipid-free cleansers were found to be the most appropriate type of cleanser for acne-prone skin as they were associated with a low risk of skin irritation, and a near-physiological stratum corneum pH. Moisturizers typically included ingredients such as humectants, emollients, oil absorbers, and those with anti-inflammatory and/or barrier replenishing properties. Given the various adjunctive products available, decision frameworks were created for clinicians to use when selecting over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers for acne-prone patients.

Conclusion

Informing clinicians about skin barrier dysfunction in acne and the benefits of adjunctive skincare may help them to choose the right product(s) to complement prescription therapy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(11): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5536.

### Racial / ethnic variations in acne: a practical algorithm for treatment and maintenance, including skincare recommendations for skin of color patients with acne [^114f7Mmn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation, sequelae, and desired treatment outcomes for acne have been reported. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) frequently occurs in patients with richly pigmented skin complexions and can frequently be the most bothersome aspect of acne in this population.

Methods

The project used a modified Delphi hybrid process comprising face-to-face discussions followed by an online follow-up. A structured literature search was conducted to identify publications on racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation, sequelae, and desired treatment outcomes for skin of color (SOC) patients with acne. The advisors subsequently convened to review the results and draft an algorithm for the treatment and maintenance, including skincare recommendations, for SOC patients with acne. Online, the panel reviewed and adopted the algorithm using published evidence coupled with the panel's expert opinion and clinical experience.

Results

Studies suggest that strategies for improving outcomes in patients with acne who have SOC include: the early initiation and maintenance of treatment regimens; careful consideration of the tolerability of active ingredients, vehicle formulations, and dosing; and the use of skin care (eg, pH balanced, non-irritating cleansers, and non-comedogenic moisturizers) to minimize irritation or dryness.

Conclusion

Acne treatment in patients with SOC involves unique therapeutic considerations, including management of PIH through efficacious longitudinal acne treatment, prevention of irritation, and potential active treatment of PIH. Skincare products are recommended as an adjunct to prescription therapy to maximize tolerability and may also play a role in maintenance therapy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21:11(Suppl 2):s3–14.

### Assessment and clinical implications of absorption of sunscreens across skin [^1123zBRi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Topical sunscreen products are widely used for protection of the skin against the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen agents are incorporated into many everyday-use cosmetics as well as so called 'beach' products. An ideal sunscreen product will provide effective protection against UV radiation with minimal skin absorption of the active ingredients. There is now clear evidence that a common sunscreen chemical, benzophenone-3, is absorbed systemically following topical application to the skin. Other more lipophilic sunscreens are absorbed into the skin, but penetration to deeper tissues and the cutaneous circulation appears to be limited. However, the extent to which sunscreens that are absorbed into the stratum corneum are absorbed to deeper tissues and the systemic circulation over time is currently unknown. The formulation vehicle in which the sunscreen is presented to the skin has a significant effect on absorption into and through the skin. Alcohol-based formulations appear to increase sunscreen absorption. In addition, some sunscreen chemicals may enhance the skin absorption of other sunscreens when applied in combination. Clearly, further research into the influence of sunscreen and formulation properties on skin absorption could lead to optimal design of sunscreen products with respect to efficacy and minimizing absorption. Despite the extensive use of sunscreen products, there have been few reports of adverse effects, and these tend to be limited to acute dermatitis and allergies. Some recent reports have raised concerns that sunscreen chemicals may damage tissues, particularly in the presence of UV radiation. Further research into the toxicity of sunscreens is urgently required. Given the information currently available and the importance of protecting the skin against sun damage, there is no clear justification for restricting the use of sunscreen products at this time.

Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing.

Photodermatoses are relatively uncommon, but most dermatologists will have to diagnose and treat them at some point. This article highlights several photodermatoses, their common symptoms and possible. Unfortunately, sunscreens marketed in the United States do not presently contain agents that are effective against longer wavelengths. There are agents available in other countries that offer better protection. It is hypothesized that these products will soon be available in the United States. Until such time, clinicians should recommend agents with avobenzones, benzophenones, and the physical blockers titanium oxides. Two other agents, dihydroxyacetone and iron oxide, may also offer benefit in some of these patients.

Moreover, if either the 'decisive test' or the 'pooled analysis' solutions were implemented within regulation, manufacturers, in order to minimise risks, could be led to perform multiple SPF tests before products are even placed on the market in the first place (step 1 in figure 1). While this could anyway be a prudent thing to do, conducting more than one SPF test before a product is launched is also uneconomical, possibly unfair, as not all manufacturers have the same financial means, and unethical, as human subjects are involved in those tests.

Given that the labelling non-conformity identified by the competent authority in the example of figure 1 is independent of the characteristics of the product and it is not due to any incorrect application of the method, another solution might be to use a 'tolerance level' (that is, an acceptable amount of variation in the SPF test results) to compare the results from the two tests before a conclusion is reached as to whether there exists a non-conformity with the labelling of the product or not.

The benefit of incorporating an additional step within regulation (between steps 5 and 6 in figure 1) with a tolerance level to discriminate whether different SPF results can be considered different or the same as they relate to labelling is that it would avoid exposing the public to (unintentional) mislabelling, and manufacturers to legal disputes, which is what today's legal framework could inevitably lead to, as highlighted in steps 12 and 13 in figure 1. Additionally, establishing a tolerance level would be simple to implement within current regulations, only requiring one change to cosmetics law for the case of non-compliance with sunscreen's SPF labels (ie, chapter VIII in 2009/1223/EC), and it would not have the incentive to manufacturers to conduct multiple tests before products are commercialised, since the risk of having a mislabelled SPF due to the variability of the method could already be accounted for within the tolerance level.

### Lazertinib (Lazcluze) [^114BNNE8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of lazertinib PO (also known as Lazcluze):

- **Cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lazertinib in combination with amivantamab has been associated with an increased risk of cutaneous adverse reactions, including severe rash, dermatitis, acneiform rash, pruritus, and dry skin. Advise using alcohol-free emollient cream to reduce dermatologic adverse reactions. Counsel patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with lazertinib and amivantamab, advise wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen. Consider offering prophylactic measures, such as oral antibiotics, to reduce the risk of cutaneous adverse reactions. Administer oral corticosteroids for the management of grade 3 reactions and consider seeking a dermatologic consultation. Refer patients with severe rash, atypical appearance, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue lazertinib and amivantamab based on severity. Decrease the dose to 160 mg for the first reduction and to 80 mg for the second reduction.
- **ILD**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lazertinib in combination with amivantamab has been associated with an increased risk of ILD/pneumonitis. Discontinue lazertinib and amivantamab if ILD/pneumonitis develops.
- **Increased serum drug levels**: use caution in patients taking drugs that are CYP3A4 or BCRP substrates, as lazertinib is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor and a BCRP inhibitor and can increase the serum concentrations of these drugs.
- **Ocular toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lazertinib in combination with amivantamab has been associated with an increased risk of ocular toxicity, including keratitis. Refer patients to an ophthalmologist for new or worsening eye symptoms. Withhold lazertinib and amivantamab in cases of grade 3 and 4 reactions until resolution to grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Resume both drugs at reduced doses or continue only lazertinib. Consider permanently discontinuing if there is no recovery within 4 weeks. Decrease the dose to 160 mg for the first reduction and to 80 mg for the second reduction.
- **VTE**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as lazertinib in combination with amivantamab has been associated with an increased risk of serious and fatal venous thromboembolic events, including DVT and PE. Administer prophylactic anticoagulation, excluding VKAs, for the first 4 months of treatment. Withhold lazertinib and amivantamab in cases of grade 2 and 3 reactions and administer anticoagulants. Resume both drugs at the same dose level once anticoagulation is initiated. Withhold lazertinib and permanently discontinue amivantamab in cases of grade 4 or recurrent grade 2 or 3 reactions. Resume lazertinib after initiating anticoagulants.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This was a post hoc analysis of two identical multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, vehicle‐controlled, parallel group clinical studies in pediatric subjects with moderate‐to‐severe acne. Protocols received approval before patient enrollment from the appropriate institutional review board (IRB) and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. All subjects were informed of the study details and provided written consent.

2.2 Study population

Eligible subjects included male and female patients of any race and ethnicity aged 9‐13 years who presented with 20‐40 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 20‐100 noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), and two nodules or less. A washout period of 2‐4 weeks was required for subjects who used previous prescription and over‐the‐counter acne treatments.

Subjects were enrolled with an Evaluator Global Severity Score (EGSS) of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe); randomized (1:1) to tretinoin 0.05% lotion or matched vehicle lotion applied once daily for 12 weeks. They were instructed to gently wash their faces with approved cleanser and warm water, rinsing thoroughly and gently patting their face dry. During the study, each subject was permitted to use only approved nonmedicated cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Lists of approved cleanser and moisturizers were provided. Subjects applied a pea‐sized amount of study drug, dotted on six facial areas, and gently rubbed into the skin covering the entire face (excluding mouth, eyes, inside nose, and lips). Study drug was applied the same time of day, once daily for 12 weeks.

### Recommendations for using over-the-counter products as adjunctive acne care in Asian phototypes: improving treatment outcomes and managing side effects [^115TLWEH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common inflammatory skin disorder prevalent among all ethnic groups. This review aimed to investigate the current literature regarding the potential benefit of over-the-counter (OTC) adjuncts (eg, moisturizers, cleansers) for acne patients focusing on Asian phenotypes.

Methods

An online procedure was employed to review the role of adjunctive OTC acne treatment. A panel consisting of dermatologists with expertise in treating Asian acne patients participated in a pre-meeting survey that collected information regarding their recommendation habits for OTC products in acne patients. Recommendations on using OTC products as an adjunct for treating acne in Asians are based on the pre-meeting survey results, evidence from literature presented during a series of plenary lectures, and discussions conducted during a stepwise program of sessions.

Results

Many topical treatments have been associated with adverse events (AEs) (eg, skin dryness, erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, pruritus). Multiple studies on topical acne treatments have found that Asians display greater sensitivity and less tolerability than Caucasians to acne treatment. Skincare as an adjunct to acne treatment may reduce dryness or irritation, particularly important in Asians with acne.

Conclusions

Advisors agreed that cleansers and moisturizers should be considered for their beneficial adjunctive role in the armamentarium of acne treatment and maintenance strategies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11): 1213–1221. doi:10.36849/JDD.6259.

### Photoprotection for skin of all color: consensus and clinical guidance from an expert panel [^116bDsYw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The negative effects of sun exposure have become better accepted among health care professionals and the lay public over recent decades. Most attention has been focused on the effects of UV light, particularly UVB wavelengths (290–320 nm). Accordingly, products to protect skin from sunlight-associated harm (sunscreens) have been developed to minimize UVB exposure. The effects of longer wavelengths, including UVA (320–400 nm) and visible light (VL, 400–700 nm), are increasingly appreciated. VL accounts for approximately half of the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface and understanding of its effects on the skin is improving. Studies have shown that VL can induce hyperpigmentation in individuals with dark skin types (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI). In addition, VL can contribute to the exacerbation of pigmentary disorders, including melasma. Because these findings are relatively new, there are gaps in understanding the needs for photoprotection and guidance for clinicians. A panel of dermatologists and photobiologists was convened to develop consensus recommendations and clinical guidance about sunscreen use relevant to the current understanding of risks associated with sun exposure using a modified Delphi method.

### Realistic sunscreen durability: a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical study [^114bF6Si]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Studies show that sunscreen under real-life conditions is often not reapplied and/or applied insufficiently. This study investigated the durability of 2 current sunscreens with different SPF protection over an 8-hour period under simulated real-life conditions.

Methods

Participants (n = 24) were randomized into two study groups utilizing either 2 mg/cm² (FDA testing concentration) or 1 mg/cm² (real-life application levels) of sunscreen. Two current SPF 15 and 70 sunscreens were applied to test spots on each participant's back. SPF values were obtained at baseline, 3.5, and 8 hours after initial application, during which subjects completed 30 minutes of moderate exercise followed by 80 minutes of water exposure.

Results

Participants in both dose study groups revealed only a 15–40% overall decrease in their SPF protection 8 hours after application. The study group that received half the FDA test concentration of sunscreen achieved approximately half or less the labeled SPF. At 8 hours, the test sites that received SPF 70 maintained an average SPF greater than 64 (2 mg/cm² application) and 26 (1 mg/cm² application). Similarly, the SPF 15 product test sites revealed an in vivo protection of 13 (2 mg/cm²) and 7 (1 mg/cm²).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that current sunscreens may be durable on skin even following significant exercise and water exposure, suggesting that reapplication intervals may be longer than currently recommended. In addition, the higher SPF sunscreen maintained a skin cancer-protective level of SPF following extended use. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(1):116–117.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111N34qo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Adapalene prescribing information — topical treatment of acne vulgaris is indicated in patients ≥ 12 years of age. Apply a thin film of adapalene to the entire face and any other affected areas of the skin once daily in the evening, after washing gently with a nonmedicated soap. Should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to adapalene or any of the components in the vehicle. Clinical studies show that 16% of patients applying 0.1% topical adapalene and 21% of patients applying 0.3% topical adapalene had successful treatments after 12 weeks (using Investigator's Global Assessment). Reported adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, dry skin, burning/stinging, skin discomfort, pruritus, desquamation, sunburn, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, face/eyelid edema, lip swelling, and angioedema. Has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients; concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products should be approached with caution, and use with caution is advised especially when using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use, and weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether adapalene is excreted in human milk, and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

Allergic reactions to sunscreens are relatively rare. However, as the public become more conscious of the dangers of excessive sunlight exposure, the use of sunscreens is increasing. They are also being incorporated into general cosmetics on a more frequent basis. Sunscreens contain a variety of potential sensitizers which may lead to contact and/or photocontact allergic dermatitis, and as pharmaceutical companies continue to manufacture and incorporate new UV filters it is crucial that we remain up to date and aware of these agents to include in patch and photopatch testing batteries. Furthermore, the creation of a European consensus statement regarding methodology in photopatch testing has enabled greater standardization and comparison of patch test results across centers.

### Efficacy and safety of N-acetyl-GED-0507–34-LEVO gel in patients with moderate-to severe facial acne vulgaris: a phase IIb randomized double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial [^113hK2hQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomization and masking

Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1) to receive one of three treatments (vehicle gel; NAC‐GED 5% gel; or NAC‐GED 2% gel) for once‐daily face application for 12 weeks, according to the randomization list stratified by site (Figure 1). The tube weight, gel appearance, texture and odour of all three formulations were identical.

Figure 1
Trial profile. GCP, good clinical practice; IGA, Investigator Global Assessment; NAC‐GED, N ‐acetyl‐GED‐0507‐34‐LEVO; PP, per‐protocol.

Each site received whole blocks of individual treatment kits. Randomization numbers and kit numbers were generated and assigned to the patients on study day 1 using a central Interactive Web Response System. Patients, sponsor site personnel and study personnel were blinded to the treatment.

Procedures

On day 1, patients applied the first dose to the whole of their face, under investigator supervision; thereafter, doses were applied once daily (evening) at home. Follow‐up site visits were conducted at weeks 3, 6, 12 and 14, and telephone visits at week 9, during which compliance and history of adverse events (AEs) were examined. Any other acne treatment was excluded. The patients were instructed to clean their faces with a gentle, noncomedogenic cleanser and were advised not to overuse skin‐covering cosmetics and sunscreen. Acne severity was assessed at every visit using the 4‐point IGA score according to the Food and Drug Administration's Acne Guidance 2006/2014 (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe) based on live assessments by the clinical investigator. Moreover, for each patient, the principal investigator performed additional photographic evaluations. Two blinded dermatologists, internationally recognized as acne experts, verified the IGA scoring using photographic evidence, guaranteeing consistency across trial sites and providing a quality‐control measure. Inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions on the face were counted and recorded at each site visit. Total lesion count (TLC) was calculated as the sum of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions on the face.

Figure 2
Schema for management of skin toxicity associated with MEK inhibitors.

Evidence‐based approaches for treating dermatologic toxicities specifically in individuals treated with MEK inhibitors are lacking. The following recommendations are based on expert opinion for the treatment of comparable skin conditions unless otherwise specified and are outlined in Figure 2.

Management of dermatologic toxicities should include both preventive measures and symptomatic treatments 37. Education regarding preventive management should commence with the initiation of MEK therapy for all patients in order to maintain skin moisture and minimize the risk of infection. Daily baths (not showers) using mild cleansers and a high‐quality skin moisturizer applied over the entire body twice a day and within 5 minutes after taking a bath is recommended. Bleach baths 3–4 times per week may reduce the risk of infection and ameliorate inflammation and pruritus 38. For a bleach bath, one‐quarter to one‐half cup of bleach is added to a full bathtub, or 1 tsp per gallon, and the patient soaks for 5–10 minutes, followed by a rinse with water and application of an emollient diffusely on the skin. Hair should be washed daily, and a selenium‐based shampoo can be used for a dry or itchy scalp. Products with added fragrance such as soaps, laundry detergent, and scented creams should be avoided. Ultraviolet light can trigger acneiform rash and skin inflammation in patients on MEK inhibitors. All patients should be advised to practice good sun safety including the use of cover‐ups, such as a wide‐brimmed hat and lightweight clothing that covers the skin. Sunscreen that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide should also be applied every 2–3 hours when outdoors and applied to the face daily even when not planning to be outdoors.

### Are in-market control systems for sunscreens adequate for consumer protection? A review of the legal framework regulating sun protection factor labels in Europe [^1122HFBJ]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Abstract

Public health authorities and regulations in Europe protect the population against the damaging effects of excessive solar ultraviolet radiation through, among other means, monitoring marketed sunscreens and enforcing compliance with sun protection factor labelling requirements. In-market control processes are fundamental and complementary to other public health initiatives in a context of suboptimal sunscreen use in real-world settings. However, the laboratory testing method used for determining the sun protection factor of sunscreens is known to produce variability of results. The combination of an inherently variable testing method with the necessary rigidity of regulations generates volatility in the decision-making process followed by regulators during official in-market controls and exposes sunscreens to be susceptible to accidental mislabelling challenges. This leads to a paradoxical situation that may leave most sunscreens incorrectly labelled in the market and to a potential dilemma for authorities. The issue may get further amplified when non-official sources echo and broadcast uncontrolled messages about sunscreens to the public. Amending current regulation with a tolerance level to compare results that accommodates the variability of results from sun protection factor tests would ease decision-making, bring robustness to an uncertain legal landscape, make more efficient the efforts to convey consistent public health messages about the benefits of sunscreen use and better protect users. There are precedents of using tolerance levels for regulatory decision-making in other fields, and a review of the applicable legal landscape in Europe reveals that implementing it for sunscreens would only require one change to current cosmetics law.

### Photo visualization of skintone compatibility of an SPF 35 sunscreen [^112RRsBv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Visual casts and discoloration are common barriers to sunscreen use in melanin-rich populations. However, photoprotective measures are essential for individuals with all skin types, including darker skin.

Methods

Single-center, 7-day, open-label study of healthy adult females with Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) IV to VI and sensitive skin treated with once-daily daily facial moisturizer sun protection factor 35 (DFM SPF35). Subjects completed a cosmetic acceptability questionnaire at days 1 and 7. Photography using VISIA&nbsp; CR was performed at day 7. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

Results

Thirty-two (32) subjects participated; 31.3% had FST IV, 53.1% V, and 15.6% VI skin. DFM SPF35 was viewed as cosmetically elegant. At day 1, 96.7% of subjects agreed product was easy to apply; 90.0% reported soft skin after product use; 86.7% said it had a lightweight, non-greasy feel and hydrated the skin. At day 7, 93.7% reported no visible white residue on their skin and said the product applied easily/absorbed well. The majority (90.6%) would continue using and would recommend the product; and 87.5% reported the product blended seamlessly into their skin, which agreed with clinical photography. Responses were consistent among subjects with normal, oily, or combination skin. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

DFM SPF35 blended well into the skin and was perceived favorably among subjects with SOC after 1 and 7 days of use. Subjects felt it had good cosmetic acceptability without unacceptable white residues or a greasy feeling. Dermatologists need to be versed in products that can be used on a variety of skin types.J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(7):515–518.&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8223.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^1153z4Qq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, effective sunscreens must attenuate UVB to prevent erythema. In theory, this should inhibit vitamin D 3 biosynthesis. However, the doses of UVB necessary are low (i.e. substantially suberythemal) so that typical sunscreen use does not lead to vitamin D insufficiency in practice in healthy people. Indeed, even optimal sunscreen use allows good vitamin D synthesis under high UVI conditions. Better UVA protection for a given SPF results in a de facto reduction of UVB protection. UVA protection will have no impact on vitamin D synthesis (see Fig. 3 b), and indeed may prevent photodegradation. Increased UVB for a given SPF should in theory and in practice result in better vitamin D synthesis. Studies done to date have been with lighter‐skinned individuals, and conclusions may not apply to those with darker skin types IV–VI who use sunscreens. In such cases, oral supplementation may be advisable.

### Are in-market control systems for sunscreens adequate for consumer protection? A review of the legal framework regulating sun protection factor labels in Europe [^114Ebn3v]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

The impact of in-market controls and public health initiatives to the public

Beyond, and regardless of, the variabilities encountered in SPF laboratory tests, several factors contribute to making the SPF value determined in a laboratory to be an overestimation of the actual SPF achieved in real conditions. For instance, the amount of product applied in real-world settings (estimated at 0.4–1.2 mg/cm²) is less than the amount used in laboratory tests (2 mg/cm²). A 50% reduction in the amount of product applied can lower the actual SPF value by a factor of four. Sweat, rubbing and environmental factors also diminish the efficacy of a sunscreen over time, and users often miss out on adequately covering certain parts of exposed areas. Besides the SPF, which is primarily a measure of the protection capacity of a sunscreen against UVB radiation (290–320 nm), protection against UVA (320–400 nm) is likewise important. Multiple other factors (eg, the contribution of visible light to erythema, the time of the day and solar zenith angle) further contribute to making the SPF achieved in natural sun exposure conditions differ from that measured in the laboratory. Consequently, public health efforts aim at improving sun protection by, among other considerations (eg, seeking shade, using protective clothing and sunglasses), incentivising and conveying messages about the correct use of sunscreens.

The consistency of public health messages through mainstream programmes and advertising campaigns, as well as the systematic use of sunscreen at a population level, have demonstrated to be highly effective in improving the population's sun protectionand saving healthcare costs. These efforts rely on the robustness of sunscreen labels and are undertaken by bodies such as governmental agencies, healthcare institutions and medical associations.

Nonetheless, official public health messages compete with (sometimes conflicting) messages about sunscreen use delivered by other stakeholder groups. In fact, with the uptake of social media and other content delivery platforms, there has been an increase of commentary from non-official sources promoting sunscreen related content with no scientific backup. For the average consumer, the number of impacts received and the variety of sources involved is large and diverse, to the extent that consumers are often confused, may have misconceptions about the factors important in a sunscreen, and may even not always understand the meaning of sunscreen labels.

### Sunscreen: how to help protect your skin from the sun… [^111D7xZm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours, and more often if you're sweating or swimming. Questions About Sunscreen General directions: Sunscreens are made in a wide range of SPFs. Higher SPF values provide greater sunburn protection. Because SPF values are determined from a test that measures protection against sunburn, SPF values primarily indicate a sunscreen's UVB protection. To get the most protection out of sunscreen, choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Sunscreens that are not broad spectrum or that lack an SPF of at least 15 must carry the following warning on their Drug Facts label: Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging. Every FDA-regulated drug product has active ingredients and inactive ingredients.

In the case of sunscreen, active ingredients are the ones that are protecting your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. Inactive ingredients are all other ingredients that are not active ingredients, such as water or oil that may be used in formulating sunscreens. Below is a list of commonly used active ingredients in products that are labeled as sunscreen:

- Aminobenzoic acid
- Avobenzone
- Cinoxate
- Dioxybenzone
- Homosalate
- Meradimate
- Octocrylene
- Octinoxate
- Octisalate
- Oxybenzone
- Padimate O
- Ensulizole
- Sulisobenzone
- Titanium dioxide
- Zinc oxide.
- When you choose a sunscreen, think about where you'll be using it. If you'll be anywhere near a flame source, avoid any product with a flammability warning, and choose another non-flammable sunscreen product instead. This recommendation is particularly important when it comes to choosing a product for children, since they are frequently active and may be near flame sources.

Recalled sunscreens You may have heard that certain spray sunscreens were recalled because of benzene contamination. FDA recommends that consumers not use recalled sunscreens. Find out if your sunscreen was recalled. FDA continues to monitor the quality of drugs and, when appropriate, encourages retailers to remove products from store shelves and online marketplaces when issues arise. Consumers should continue to use sunscreen, along with other sun protection measures, to reduce risks from sun exposure.
