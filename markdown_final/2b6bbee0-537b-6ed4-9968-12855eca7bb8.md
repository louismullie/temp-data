## Question

Lokelma dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing schema and whether it distinguishes acute correction from maintenance. Then, I should verify onset and magnitude of effect to anchor expectations. Next, I will examine special populations, especially hemodialysis, and confirm dose adjustments. After that, I need to check administration details, drug–drug interactions, and safety monitoring. Finally, I will integrate guideline context and synthesize a practical, stepwise dosing approach with caveats and monitoring cadence.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing framework. The FDA prescribing information recommends an initial treatment dose of 10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours, followed by maintenance therapy at 10 g once daily, with subsequent dose adjustments based on serum potassium and a recommended maintenance range of 5 g every other day up to 15 g once daily, which I should explicitly note as the labeled ceiling [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7] [^1fbdf115].

> Wait, let me verify the onset and magnitude of effect so I don't overpromise. In the HARMONIZE phase 3 trial, 10 g three times daily reduced mean potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mEq/L over 48 hours, with a median time to normokalemia of 2.2 hours and 84% achieving normokalemia by 24 hours and 98% by 48 hours, which aligns with the clinical observation that meaningful reductions begin within 1 hour and accumulate over 24–48 hours, supporting the 48-hour acute phase duration [^c2e67133] [^bd3c9027] [^899cb7df].

> Hold on, I should verify the maintenance-phase data to justify the 10 g daily starting point. In the randomized withdrawal phase of HARMONIZE, once-daily doses of 5, 10, and 15 g all maintained lower potassium than placebo, with dose-dependent efficacy and higher proportions maintaining normokalemia at higher doses, which supports starting at 10 g daily and titrating within 5–15 g based on response and tolerability [^c2e67133] [^bd3c9027].

> I need to check the hemodialysis scenario carefully. For patients on chronic hemodialysis, Lokelma is dosed only on non-dialysis days, typically starting at 5 g once daily with consideration of 10 g once daily if baseline potassium is greater than 6.5 mEq/L, and then titrating in 5 g increments to a maximum of 15 g on non-dialysis days, with assessments after dose changes to avoid hypokalemia during the long interdialytic interval [^535cf636] [^37c744c8] [^6917a7ab].

> Let me consider administration and drug–drug interactions so I don't miss practical pitfalls. Lokelma should be mixed with water and consumed immediately, and other oral medications should be separated by at least 2 hours before or after to avoid binding interactions; I initially thought the separation should be 3 hours like some other binders, but wait, I should correct that — the FDA label specifies a 2-hour separation for Lokelma, whereas 3 hours applies to patiromer and polystyrene sulfonates, so I need to ensure I'm citing the right agent-specific interval [^535cf636] [^99cf6c8a] [^83bcf5d7].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring so dosing is balanced with risk. Edema is dose-related and more frequent at 15 g daily, reflecting sodium load, so monitor for fluid retention, especially in heart failure or CKD; hypokalemia can occur and warrants dose reduction or discontinuation if potassium falls below the desired target; in hemodialysis patients, acute illness with reduced intake or diarrhea increases hypokalemia risk and may require dose adjustment; Lokelma is radio-opaque and may mimic contrast on abdominal imaging, so clinicians should be aware when interpreting films [^14b7e10c] [^cca5eb43] [^6d731a18].

> I should confirm special populations and contraindications. Safety and efficacy in pediatrics are not established, whereas older adults comprised a large proportion of trial participants without unique safety signals; avoid use in severe constipation, bowel obstruction, or impaction due to potential ineffectiveness and worsening GI conditions; pregnancy and lactation are not expected to result in systemic exposure given non-absorption, though clinical data are limited [^a13b5233] [^cca5eb43].

> Let me integrate guideline context to ensure alignment. KDIGO 2024 CKD guidance supports potassium binders, including sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, to enable RAAS blockade and recommends dosing ranges and administration timing consistent with the FDA label, while emphasizing monitoring and mitigation strategies; ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure guidance notes potassium binders can facilitate RAASi continuation, though outcome benefits remain under investigation, reinforcing the need for close potassium surveillance during titration [^99cf6c8a] [^83bcf5d7] [^a5a76dea] [^d3aab6c7].

> But wait, what if the presentation is acute and severe — should I still use Lokelma alone? I should double-check the limitation. The FDA explicitly states Lokelma should not be used as emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of delayed onset; in emergencies, prioritize membrane stabilization with IV calcium, intracellular shifting with insulin and glucose, beta-agonists, and definitive removal with dialysis as indicated, while Lokelma may be layered in for ongoing control once the patient is stabilized [^b493e082] [^839a273b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each step. For acute correction, use 10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours, reassessing potassium at 24–48 hours; for maintenance, start 10 g once daily and titrate by 5 g at weekly or longer intervals within 5–15 g daily based on potassium targets; in hemodialysis, dose only on non-dialysis days, starting at 5–10 g with titration to 15 g as needed; separate other oral meds by 2 hours; monitor potassium frequently during initiation and after dose changes, and watch for edema and hypokalemia, adjusting accordingly [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7] [^c2e67133].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence to avoid missing early shifts. During initiation and after dose adjustments, check serum potassium within about a week in non-dialysis patients and after the long interdialytic interval in hemodialysis patients, then space to every 1–4 weeks once stable, with more frequent checks if RAASi therapy is being intensified or if intercurrent illness alters intake or GI function [^535cf636] [^ce831623].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and reference-anchored. Lokelma's labeled regimen is 10 g TID for up to 48 hours followed by 10 g daily with 5–15 g maintenance range, with faster onset than legacy binders but still not for emergent stabilization; hemodialysis requires non-dialysis-day dosing with a 5–15 g range; administration separation and edema/hypokalemia monitoring are essential; and guideline concordance supports binder use to preserve RAASi when hyperkalemia limits therapy, with patient-specific titration and vigilance for adverse effects [^535cf636] [^c2e67133] [^99cf6c8a] [^a5a76dea].

---

Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is dosed in two phases: **acute correction** and **maintenance**. For acute hyperkalemia, give **10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours** [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7]. For maintenance, use **10 g once daily**, titrating by 5 g to a range of 5 g every other day to 15 g daily based on serum potassium [^535cf636] [^c2e67133]. In hemodialysis patients, start 5–10 g on non-dialysis days and titrate to 5–15 g [^535cf636] [^6917a7ab]. Separate other oral medications by at least 2 hours [^535cf636] [^6d731a18] and monitor potassium regularly to avoid hypokalemia [^14b7e10c].

---

## Indications

Lokelma is indicated for the **treatment of hyperkalemia in adults** [^b493e082] [^fba98550]. It is not intended for emergency treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia due to its delayed onset of action [^b493e082].

---

## Dosage and administration

### Acute correction phase

- **Initial dose**: 10 g orally three times daily (TID) for up to 48 hours [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7].
- **Administration**: Mix each 10 g dose with approximately 3 tablespoons of water, stir well, and drink immediately. If powder remains, add more water, stir, and drink until no powder remains [^535cf636].
- **Onset of action**: Reductions in serum potassium are observed within 1 hour of administration, with continued decline over 48 hours [^899cb7df] [^c2e67133].

---

### Maintenance phase

- **Initial maintenance dose**: 10 g once daily [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7].
- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust based on serum potassium levels, titrating by 5 g increments at intervals of one week or longer. The recommended maintenance dose range is 5 g every other day to 15 g once daily [^535cf636] [^c2e67133].
- **Maximum dose**: 15 g once daily [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7].

---

## Special populations

### Patients on chronic hemodialysis

- **Initial dose**: 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days [^535cf636] [^6917a7ab].
- **Higher starting dose**: Consider 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days if serum potassium is > 6.5 mEq/L [^535cf636].
- **Dose adjustment**: Titrate based on pre-dialysis serum potassium levels after the long interdialytic interval, with a maintenance range of 5–15 g once daily on non-dialysis days [^535cf636] [^37c744c8].
- **Monitoring**: Assess serum potassium after one week following initiation or dose adjustment [^535cf636].

---

### Pediatric patients

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have **not been established** [^a13b5233].

---

### Geriatric patients

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between older and younger patients, but **greater sensitivity in older adults cannot be ruled out** [^a13b5233].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

Clinical trials demonstrate that Lokelma effectively lowers serum potassium in both the acute and maintenance phases. In the HARMONIZE trial, 10 g TID for 48 hours reduced mean serum potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mEq/L, with 84% achieving normokalemia within 24 hours and 98% within 48 hours [^c2e67133]. Maintenance dosing of 5, 10, or 15 g once daily maintained normokalemia in 80%, 90%, and 94% of patients, respectively, compared to 46% with placebo [^c2e67133].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hypokalemia**: Monitor serum potassium regularly and adjust the dose to prevent hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) [^14b7e10c].
- **Edema**: Each 5 g dose contains approximately 400 mg of sodium. Monitor for edema, particularly in patients with heart failure or renal disease, and adjust dietary sodium intake as needed [^cca5eb43] [^14b7e10c].
- **Drug interactions**: Administer other oral medications at least 2 hours before or after Lokelma to avoid interference with absorption [^535cf636] [^6d731a18].
- **Gastrointestinal adverse events**: Avoid use in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction, or impaction [^cca5eb43].

2.1 Recommended Dosage

For initial treatment of hyperkalemia, the recommended dose of LOKELMA is 10 g administered three times a day for up to 48 hours. Administer LOKELMA orally as a suspension in water [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For continued treatment, the recommended dose is 10 g once daily. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the serum potassium level and desired target range. During maintenance treatment, up-titrate based on the serum potassium level at intervals of 1-week or longer and in increments of 5 g. Decrease the dose of LOKELMA or discontinue if the serum potassium is below the desired target range. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g every other day to 15 g daily.

2.2 Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis

For patients on chronic hemodialysis, administer LOKELMA only on non-dialysis days.

The recommended starting dose is 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days. Consider a starting dose of 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days in patients with serum potassium greater than 6.5 mEq/L. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic interval and desired target range.

During initiation and after a dose adjustment, assess serum potassium after one week. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g to 15 g once daily, on non-dialysis days.

Discontinue or decrease the dose of LOKELMA if:

serum potassium falls below the desired target range based on the pre-dialysis value after the long interdialytic interval, or;
the patient develops clinically significant hypokalemia

2.3 Reconstitution and Administration

In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients to empty the entire contents of the packet(s) into a drinking glass containing approximately 3 tablespoons of water or more if desired. Stir well and drink immediately. If powder remains in the drinking glass, add water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat until no powder remains to ensure the entire dose is taken.

14.2 Study 2

The efficacy of LOKELMA was also demonstrated in a two-part trial with an open-label acute phase and a month-long randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal phase (Study 2; NCT02088073).

In the open-label acute phase of Study 2, 258 patients with hyperkalemia (baseline mean 5.6 mEq/L, range 5.1 to 7.4 mEq/L) received 10 g of LOKELMA administered three times daily with meals for 48 hours. As shown in Figure 3, left, average serum potassium levels decreased from 5.6 to 4.5 mEq/L during treatment with LOKELMA in the acute phase.

Following the acute phase of the study, there was a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase where patients who achieved potassium levels between 3.5 and 5 mEq/L were randomized to one of three doses of LOKELMA administered once-daily for 28 days, or placebo just before breakfast. Of the patients enrolled in the acute phase, 92% achieved a potassium level within this range and were enrolled into the second phase of the trial.

The primary endpoint in the randomized withdrawal phase was the mean serum potassium value over the period from Day 8 to Day 29, comparing LOKELMA-treated and placebo-treated patients. All three doses (5, 10 and 15 g) of once daily LOKELMA maintained mean potassium at lower levels than placebo (mean serum potassium was 4.8, 4.5, and 4.4 mEq/L for the 5, 10 and 15 g dose groups, respectively, vs. 5.1 mEq/L in the placebo group, p ≤ 0.001 for all doses, Figure 3, right). A greater proportion of patients had mean serum potassium levels in the normal range (3.5 to 5 mEq/L) while on LOKELMA than while on placebo (80%, 90% and 94% at the 5, 10 and 15 g doses, respectively, vs. 46% on placebo).

14.5 Study 4

The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 196 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 58 years, range 20 to 86 years) with persistent pre-dialysis hyperkalemia (mean baseline potassium 5.8 mEq/L) who were randomized to receive LOKELMA 5 g or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days (NCT03303521). During the dose adjustment period (initial 4 weeks), the dose was adjusted weekly in 5 g increments up to 15 g once daily based on pre-dialysis serum potassium measurement after the long inter-dialytic interval to achieve a pre-dialysis serum potassium level between 4.0–5.0 mEq/L. The dose reached at the end of the dose-adjustment period was maintained throughout the subsequent 4-week evaluation period.

The primary endpoint in the trial was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who maintained a pre-dialysis serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after the long inter-dialytic interval and who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation period. A greater proportion of patients were responders in the LOKELMA arm as compared to placebo (41% vs 1%, respectively; p < 0.001). The treatment effect on mean pre-dialysis serum potassium levels was maintained during continued treatment. Mean pre-dialysis serum potassium levels during the study are presented in Figure 5.

14.3 Eleven-Month Extension Study

Patients who completed the 28-day randomized withdrawal phase had the option to continue treatment with LOKELMA, taken just before breakfast, in an open-label extension phase for up to 11 months (n = 123; NCT02107092). Figure 4 shows that the treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy.

14.4 Study 3

LOKELMA was evaluated in an open-label 12-month study in 751 hyperkalemic patients (NCT02163499). The mean baseline potassium level in this study was 5.6 mEq/L. Following the acute phase treatment of LOKELMA 10 g three times a day, patients who achieved normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) within 72 hours (n = 746; 99%) entered the maintenance phase. For maintenance treatment, the initial dosage of LOKELMA was 5 g once daily and was adjusted to a minimum of 5 g every other day up to maximum of 15 g once daily, based on serum potassium level. The treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

LOKELMA (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is a non-absorbed zirconium silicate that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium. In vitro, LOKELMA has a high affinity for potassium ions, even in the presence of other cations such as calcium and magnesium. LOKELMA increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen, thereby lowering serum potassium levels.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In a study in healthy adult subjects, LOKELMA administered as 5 g or 10 g once daily for four days caused a dose-dependent increase in fecal potassium excretion. Corresponding dose-dependent decreases in urinary potassium excretion and serum potassium were also observed.

In patients with hyperkalemia treated with LOKELMA 10 g three times a day for up to 48 hours, reductions in serum potassium were observed one hour after initiation of therapy; serum potassium concentrations continued to decline over the 48-hour treatment period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In patients not continuing LOKELMA, potassium levels increased. Patients with higher starting serum potassium levels or receiving a higher dose have greater reductions in serum potassium.

LOKELMA causes a small dose-dependent increase in serum bicarbonate concentrations (1.1 mmol/L at 5 g once daily, 2.3 mmol/L at 10 g once daily and 2.6 mmol/L at 15 g once daily as compared with a mean increase of 0.6 mmol/L in patients treated with placebo). The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.

14.1 Study 1

The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was demonstrated in a two-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT01737697) in patients with hyperkalemia (5 to 6.5 mEq/L, mean potassium 5.3 mEq/L), Study 1.

In the first phase of the trial (the acute phase), 753 patients were randomized to receive one of four doses of LOKELMA (1.25, 2.5, 5 or 10 g) or placebo, administered three times daily for the initial 48 hours with meals.

The mean age of patients was 66 years, 59% of patients were men, and 86% were Caucasian. Approximately 60% of patients had chronic kidney disease, 10% had heart failure, 62% had diabetes mellitus and 67% were on renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy at baseline.

The primary endpoint in the acute phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels during the initial 48 hours of study drug treatment, comparing placebo-treated patients and LOKELMA-treated patients. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a greater reduction in serum potassium levels for the 2.5, 5 and 10 g (three times a day) dose groups compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001). As displayed in Table 1 for the secondary endpoint of potassium change from baseline, LOKELMA showed dose-dependent reductions in serum potassium at 2.5, 5 and 10 g. In patients administered 10 g TID, the mean serum potassium reduction was -0.7 mEq/L at 48 hours. Patients with higher starting potassium levels had a greater response to LOKELMA. LOKELMA was effective in lowering potassium levels in patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and those taking RAAS inhibitor therapy.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The total exposure to LOKELMA in the safety and efficacy clinical trials of patients not on dialysis with hyperkalemia was 1,760 patients with 652 patients exposed to LOKELMA for at least 6 months and 507 patients exposed for at least one year.

The population (n = 1,009) in the placebo-controlled trials included patients aged 22 to 96 years, females (n = 454), Caucasians (n = 859) and Blacks (n = 130). Patients had hyperkalemia in association with comorbid diseases such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.

In placebo-controlled trials in which patients who were not on dialysis were treated with once daily doses of LOKELMA for up to 28 days, edema was reported in 4.4% of patients receiving 5 g, 5.9% of patients receiving 10 g and 16.1% of patients receiving 15 g LOKELMA compared to 2.4% of patients receiving placebo. In longer-term uncontrolled trials in which most patients were maintained on doses < 15 g once daily, adverse reactions of edema (edema, generalized edema and peripheral edema) were reported in 8% to 11% of patients.

In a pooled analysis of clinical studies conducted in countries with a predominantly Asian population, constipation occurred in patients receiving LOKELMA with an estimated incidence of 9% and 5% for the 10 g and 5 g dose respectively. Constipation was resolved with dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation. No cases of constipation were reported in patients receiving placebo.

Laboratory Abnormalities

In clinical trials in patients who were not on dialysis, 4.1% of LOKELMA-treated patients developed hypokalemia with a serum potassium value less than 3.5 mEq/L, which resolved with dosage reduction or discontinuation of LOKELMA. In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis, 5% of patients developed pre-dialysis hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) in both the LOKELMA and placebo groups; 3% and 1% of patients developed a serum potassium < 3.0 mEq/L in the LOKELMA and placebo groups, respectively.

Patients who achieved a potassium level between 3.5 and 5 mEq/L after receiving LOKELMA during the acute phase were re-randomized to receive once daily placebo or 1.25, 2.5, 5 or 10 g of once daily LOKELMA for 12 days together with breakfast.

The primary endpoint in the maintenance phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels over the 12-day treatment interval, comparing patients receiving LOKELMA and patients receiving placebo. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint at the 5 and 10 g doses when compared with their respective placebo groups (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders. (5.1)
Edema. (5.2)
Hypokalemia in patients on hemodialysis. (5.3)
LOKELMA has radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. (5.4)

5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders

Avoid use of LOKELMA in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction or impaction, including abnormal post-operative bowel motility disorders, because LOKELMA has not been studied in patients with these conditions and may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions.

5.2 Edema

Each 5 g dose of LOKELMA contains approximately 400 mg of sodium, but the extent of absorption by the patient is unknown. In clinical trials of LOKELMA in patients who were not on dialysis, edema was observed and was generally mild to moderate in severity and was more commonly seen in patients treated with 15 g once daily. Monitor for signs of edema, particularly in patients who should restrict their sodium intake or are prone to fluid overload (e.g., heart failure or renal disease). Advise patients to adjust dietary sodium, if appropriate. Increase the dose of diuretics as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis in which most patients were treated with doses of 5 to 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days, there was no difference in the mean change from baseline in interdialytic weight gain (a measure of fluid retention) between the LOKELMA and placebo groups.

5.3 Hypokalemia in Patients on Hemodialysis

Patients on hemodialysis may be prone to acute illness that can increase the risk of hypokalemia on LOKELMA (e.g., illnesses associated with decreased oral intake, diarrhea). Consider adjusting Lokelma dose based on potassium levels in these settings.

5.4 Diagnostic Tests

LOKELMA has radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^169c3761]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Design and setting

This post hoc analysis included data pooled from two published, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials: ZS-003 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01737697) and HARMONIZE (NCT02088073). Primary safety and efficacy data from both studies previously have been reported, and short-term findings of a subset of data from this post hoc analysis previously have been summarized. Briefly, both trials enrolled patients to receive SZC (ZS-003 also included a placebo arm) three times daily (TID) for up to 48 h during the correction phase, followed by once-daily maintenance dosing for 12 days (ZS-003) or 28 days (HARMONIZE) in an outpatient setting. Both phase 3 studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent before study participation.

Study population

Inclusion criteria for the pivotal phase 3 studies included ambulatory patients aged ≥ 18 years. Patients were excluded from the studies if they were being treated as an inpatient, undergoing dialysis, had a life expectancy of < 3 months, experienced cardiac dysrhythmia that required immediate treatment, or had received treatment with K + -binding resins within 7 days. Patients selected for this analysis had baseline serum K + levels ≥ 5.5 mmol/L and received SZC 10 g TID for up to 48 h in the correction phase of either study. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had a baseline serum K + level < 5.5 mmol/L or had received any other dose of SZC. The analysis population was further stratified by baseline serum K + level (5.5– < 6.0, 6.0–6.5, and > 6.5 mmol/L).

### Emergency potassium normalization treatment including sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENERGIZE) [^f79cd432]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a novel, highly selective potassium binder currently approved in the United States and European Union for treatment of hyperkalemia. This pilot evaluation explored the efficacy of SZC with insulin and glucose as hyperkalemia treatment in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This exploratory, phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT03337477) enrolled adult ED patients with blood potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive SZC 10 g or placebo, up to three times during a 10-hour period, with insulin and glucose. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in serum potassium (sK +) from baseline until 4 hours after start of dosing.

Results

Overall, 70 patients were randomized (SZC n = 33, placebo n = 37), of whom 50.0% were male. Their mean (± standard deviation [± SD]) age was 59.0 (± 13.8) years and mean initial sK + was similar between groups (SZC 6.4 mmol/L, placebo 6.5 mmol/L). The least squares mean (± SD) sK + change from baseline to 4 hours was -0.41 (± 0.11) mmol/L and -0.27 (± 0.10) mmol/L with SZC and placebo, respectively (difference = -0.13 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.44 to 0.17). A greater reduction in mean (± SD) sK + from baseline occurred with SZC compared with placebo at 2 hours: -0.72 (± 0.12) versus -0.36 (± 0.11) mmol/L (LSM difference = -0.35 mmol/L, 95% CI = -0.68 to -0.02), respectively. A numerically lower proportion of patients in the SZC group required additional potassium-lowering therapy due to hyperkalemia at 0 to 4 hours versus placebo (15.6% vs. 30.6%, respectively; odds ratio = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.09 to 1.77). Comparable proportions of patients experienced adverse events in both treatment groups at 0 to 24 hours.

Conclusions

This pilot study suggested that SZC with insulin and glucose may provide an incremental benefit in the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia over insulin and glucose alone.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate among individuals with hyperkalemia: a 12-month phase 3 study [^1d706bbf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Oral sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (formerly ZS-9) binds and removes potassium via the gastrointestinal tract. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-associated restoration and maintenance of normokalemia and adverse events were evaluated in a two-part, open label, phase 3 trial.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In the correction phase, adult outpatients with plasma potassium ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (i-STAT Point-of-Care) received sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 10 g three times daily for 24–72 hours until normokalemic (potassium = 3.5–5.0 mmol/L). Qualifying participants entered the ≤ 12-month maintenance phase and received sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 5 g once daily titrated to maintain normokalemia without dietary or medication restrictions. Prespecified primary end points were restoration of normal serum potassium values (3.5–5.0 mmol/L) during the correction phase and maintenance of serum potassium ≤ 5.1 mmol/L during the maintenance phase. Adverse events were assessed throughout.

Results

Of 751 participants, 746 (99%) achieved normokalemia during the correction phase (mean serum potassium = 4.8 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, 4.7 to 4.8) and entered the maintenance phase; 466 (63%) participants completed the 12-month trial. Participants were predominantly white, men, and age ≥ 65 years old; 74% had an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, and 65% used renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Mean time on sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was 286 days. Mean daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate dose was 7.2 g (SD = 2.6). Over months 3–12, mean serum potassium was 4.7 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, 4.6 to 4.7); mean serum potassium values ≤ 5.1 and ≤ 5.5 mmol/L were achieved by 88% and 99% of participants, respectively. Of 483 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor users at baseline, 87% continued or had their dose increased; 11% discontinued. Among 263 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor-naïve participants, 14% initiated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy. Overall, 489 (66%) participants experienced adverse events during the maintenance phase, and 22% experienced a serious adverse event. Of eight (1%) deaths, none were considered related to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Nine (1%) and 34 (5%) participants experienced serum potassium < 3.0 and 3.0–3.4 mmol/L, respectively.

Conclusions

After achieving normokalemia, individualized once daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was associated with maintenance of normokalemia without substantial renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor changes for ≤ 12 months.

### The LIFT trial: study protocol for a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of K-binder lokelma for maximisation of RAAS inhibition in CKD patients with heart failure [^9928f4e3]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

CKD is common in heart failure (HF) and associated with morbidity and mortality, yet life-prolonging medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) are underused due to risk of hyperkalaemia. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a potassium-binding medication that has been shown to reduce incidence of hyperkalaemia in CKD, non-CKD, and HF populations, which we propose will support maximisation of RAASi therapy.

Methods

We propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants will receive either SZC or placebo. We will up-titrate participants' RAASi therapy while monitoring their serum potassium levels and adjusting their SZC dose if necessary. Participants with CKD and HF will be recruited from CKD and HF clinics at St George's Hospital. The total study period will be 18 months; 130 participants will be enrolled for approximately two months each following screening. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who achieve maximum RAASi dose while maintaining normokalaemia. Secondary outcomes include participants reaching maximum RAASi dose without severe hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to severe hyperkalaemia; number of RAASi dose escalations per participant; final doses of RAASi therapy; changes in quality of life score, eGFR, ACR, serum sodium, troponin T; number and duration of hospital admissions; and within-participant change in serum potassium compared to baseline.

Discussion

This trial will be the first to examine the use of SZC for the maximisation of RAASi dosing in patients with advanced CKD and HF. We will assess the impact of achieving target RAASi dosing on hospital admission rates and duration of stay, with the hope that optimum RAASi treatment will translate into reduced morbidity and improved QoL. If clinical benefit is demonstrated, we hope that the joint multidisciplinary CKD-HF approach will be expanded.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^49eeb297]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Reliable, timely-onset, oral treatments with an acceptable safety profile for patients with hyperkalemia are needed. We examined the efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) treatment for ≤ 48 h in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L.

Methods

Data were pooled from two phase 3 studies (ZS-003 and HARMONIZE) among patients receiving SZC 10 g three times daily. Outcomes included mean and absolute change from baseline, median time to potassium level ≤ 5.5 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, and proportion achieving potassium level ≤ 5.5 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L at 4, 24, and 48 h. Outcomes were stratified by baseline potassium. Safety outcomes were evaluated.

Results

At baseline, 125 of 170 patients (73.5%) had potassium level 5.5– < 6.0, 39 (22.9%) had potassium level 6.0–6.5, and 6 (3.5%) had potassium level > 6.5 mmol/L. Regardless of baseline potassium, mean potassium decreased at 1 h post-initial dose. By 4 and 48 h, 37.5% and 85.0% of patients achieved potassium level ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, respectively. Median (95% confidence interval) times to potassium level ≤ 5.5 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/L were 2.0 (1.1–2.0) and 21.6 (4.1–22.4) h, respectively. Fifteen patients (8.8%) experienced adverse events; none were serious.

Conclusions

SZC 10 g three times daily achieved serum potassium reduction and normokalemia, with a favorable safety profile.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosing

The majority of patients in both eGFR subgroups (81–82%) achieved normokalaemia after receiving only 30 g of SZC (administered as three 10 g doses) > 24 h (Figure 5A). During the MP, the mean (SD) daily dose of SZC was 7.8 g (2.6) and 6.8 g (2.5) for the eGFR < 30 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 subgroups, respectively (P < 0.001). In general, greater proportions of patients with baseline eGFR < 30 versus ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 required doses of 10 or 15 g QD to maintain normokalaemia as the MP progressed; and ≥ 26 and ≥ 56%, respectively, maintained normokalaemia at a dose of 5 g QD throughout the MP (Figure 5B and C). Person-time exposure to each dose of SZC was 2% for the 5 g QoD dose, 57% for the 5 g QD dose, 34% for the 10 g dose and 7% for the 15 g dose relative to the total person-time exposure to all SZC doses.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

RAASi use during the study is presented in Table 2. Among participants who were receiving RAASis at CP baseline, 70 and 78% maintained the same RAASi dose in the eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 subgroups, respectively. Corresponding proportions with a dose increase were 13 and 13% in both subgroups, with a dose decrease (not mutually exclusive with respect to dose increases) 19 and 10% and with RAASi discontinuation 14 and 8%. Of note, the proportion of patients continuing on the same dose of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)-containing RAASi regimen was 5% in both eGFR subgroups (Table 2). Among RAASi-naïve participants at CP baseline, 27 and 8% initiated RAASis in the eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 subgroups, respectively.

### Effect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on potassium lowering for 28 days among outpatients with hyperkalemia: the HARMONIZE randomized clinical trial [^c2e67133]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality that may be difficult to manage because of a lack of effective therapies. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a nonabsorbed cation exchanger that selectively binds potassium in the intestine.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zirconium cyclosilicate for 28 days in patients with hyperkalemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

HARMONIZE was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating zirconium cyclosilicate in outpatients with hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) recruited from 44 sites in the United States, Australia, and South Africa (March-August 2014).

Interventions

Patients (n = 258) received 10 g of zirconium cyclosilicate 3 times daily in the initial 48-hour open-label phase. Patients (n = 237) achieving normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) were then randomized to receive zirconium cyclosilicate, 5 g (n = 45 patients), 10 g (n = 51), or 15 g (n = 56), or placebo (n = 85) daily for 28 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was mean serum potassium level in each zirconium cyclosilicate group vs placebo during days 8–29 of the randomized phase.

Results

In the open-label phase, serum potassium levels declined from 5.6 mEq/L at baseline to 4.5 mEq/L at 48 hours. Median time to normalization was 2.2 hours, with 84% of patients (95% CI, 79%-88%) achieving normokalemia by 24 hours and 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%) by 48 hours. In the randomized phase, serum potassium was significantly lower during days 8–29 with all 3 zirconium cyclosilicate doses vs placebo (4.8 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.6–4.9], 4.5 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.4–4.6], and 4.4 mEq/L [95% CI, 4.3–4.5] for 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g; 5.1 mEq/L [95% CI, 5.0–5.2] for placebo; P < .001 for all comparisons). The proportion of patients with mean potassium < 5.1 mEq/L during days 8–29 was significantly higher in all zirconium cyclosilicate groups vs placebo (36/45 [80%], 45/50 [90%], and 51/54 [94%] for the 5-g, 10-g, and 15-g groups, vs 38/82 [46%] with placebo; P < .001 for each dose vs placebo). Adverse events were comparable between zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo, although edema was more common in the 15-g group (edema incidence: 2/85 [2%], 1/45 [2%], 3/51 [6%], and 8/56 [14%] patients in the placebo, 5-g, 10-g, and 15-g groups). Hypokalemia developed in 5/51 (10%) and 6/56 patients (11%) in the 10-g and 15-g zirconium cyclosilicate groups, vs none in the 5-g or placebo groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among outpatients with hyperkalemia, open-label sodium zirconium cyclosilicate reduced serum potassium to normal levels within 48 hours; compared with placebo, all 3 doses of zirconium cyclosilicate resulted in lower potassium levels and a higher proportion of patients with normal potassium levels for up to 28 days. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zirconium cyclosilicate beyond 4 weeks and to assess long-term clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^9bbc9f6b]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with baseline serum K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L who received SZC 10 g experienced decreases in serum K + levels from baseline within 1 h of treatment, and most patients (85%) who received SZC 10 g TID achieved normokalemia within 48 h. The reduction of serum K + levels among patients with serum K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L with SZC was achieved with an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that observed in prior studies. These results may be of particular interest to hospitalists, observation/short-stay unit providers, and urgent care and emergency department providers, who may see patients with hyperkalemia and are uncertain about their clinical trajectory. These patients are currently observed in these settings for variable periods of time at a high cost, and the results of this analysis may help guide the treatment and transition plans for these patients.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^bea85823]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the current analysis, a single dose of SZC 10 g resulted in most patients (79%) with a baseline K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L achieving a serum K + level ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, and more than one-third (38%) of all patients achieving a K + level ≤ 5.0 mmol/L within 4 h. These results are consistent with those from an earlier pooled analysis of the same two trials assessing patients with a slightly higher baseline serum K + threshold (≥ 6.0 mmol/L), which found that 52% of patients achieved a serum K + level ≤ 5.5 mmol/L by 4 h after the first SZC 10 g dose. Considering the mean baseline serum K + level in the previous analysis was 6.3 mmol/L, it is not unexpected that fewer patients in that analysis were able to achieve normalization rates comparable to that seen in the current analysis at 4 h.

### Emergency potassium normalization treatment including sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENERGIZE) [^e9187daa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although limited by the low total number of patients, treatment with SZC in addition to insulin and glucose raised no safety concerns in this patient group, and the safety profile of SZC was consistent with previous studies. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 No clinically meaningful differences in AEs between groups were observed, and SZC was associated with no AEs leading to discontinuation. No patients developed hypokalemia with SZC, despite a potentially increased risk while concomitantly receiving insulin and glucose. However, the high sK + at baseline and modified weight‐based dosing of insulin may have decreased the risk of patients developing hypokalemia while receiving treatment.

In this study, SZC and placebo were administered in addition to a background of insulin and glucose, in accordance with local routine practice. 15, 29 Previous studies have reported a significant risk of hypoglycemia as a complication of the management of hyperkalemia with insulin. 7, 31, 32 The numerically higher incidence of hypoglycemia in the SZC arm versus placebo observed in this study is not deemed to represent a difference of clinical significance. Low proportions of patients in either treatment group experienced an AE of hypoglycemia, and none of these events were considered by the study investigators to be causally related to the investigational product. In a recent review article, it was recommended to lower the amount of insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and to monitor hypoglycemia for up to 6 hours after insulin use in patients with chronic kidney disease. 12 Accordingly, in thisstudy, weight‐based dosing of insulin and a monitoring schedule was used to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. 13

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for hyperkalaemia in patients with mild / moderate versus severe / end-stage chronic kidney disease: comparative results from an open-label, phase 3 study [^1a5bd5ea]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The frequency and severity of hyperkalaemia are related to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level among those with CKD. Among these patients, hyperkalaemia prevalence defined as serum potassium (K +) ≥ 5.0 mmol/L or ≥ 5.5 mmol/L is 14–20% or 3–8%, respectively. Furthermore, for every 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR, hyperkalaemia prevalence increased by 25%.

Although renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) are mainstays of therapy among patients with proteinuric and diabetic CKD, use of maximum renoprotective RAASi dosages is limited due to RAASi-associated K + elevation risk. Patients with severe CKD (Stages 4 and 5, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) often have strict dietary requirements, including restricted intake of fluids, protein, sodium, phosphate and K +. These patients may benefit from medical management of hyperkalaemia, which may enable RAASi maintenance and fewer dietary restrictions.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is a selective K + binder approved for use in the USA and the European Union for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia. SZC binds K + early as it transits through the gastrointestinal tract and is ultimately excreted in the faeces. In the randomized, Phase 3 HARMONIZE study of SZC among outpatients with hyperkalaemia (K + ≥ 5.1 mmol/L), SZC 10 g three times daily (TID) reduced serum K + to normal levels (K + 3.5–5.0 mmol/L) within a median of 2.2 h after the first administered dose, with 84% of patients achieving normokalaemia within 24 h. Furthermore, normokalaemia was maintained by > 71% of patients receiving once daily (QD) SZC dosing through Day 29 with no protocol-defined changes in diet or RAASi use.

### A phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for reducing the incidence of predialysis hyperkalemia [^6917a7ab]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with ESRD have minimal renal potassium excretion and, despite hemodialysis, often have persistent predialysis hyperkalemia. The DIALIZE study (NCT03303521) evaluated sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) in the management of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients.

Methods

In the DIALIZE study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b multicenter study, we randomized adults with ESRD who were managed by three-times weekly hemodialysis and had predialysis hyperkalemia to receive placebo or SZC 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days, and titrated towards maintaining normokalemia over 4 weeks, in 5 g increments to a maximum of 15 g. The primary efficacy outcome was proportion of patients during the 4-week stable-dose evaluation period who maintained predialysis serum potassium of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L during at least three of four hemodialysis treatments after the long interdialytic interval and did not require urgent rescue therapy to reduce serum potassium.

Results

In total, 196 patients (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age = 58.1 [13.7] years old) were randomized to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate or placebo. Of 97 patients receiving sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, 41.2% met the primary end point and were deemed treatment responders compared with 1.0% of 99 patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). Rescue therapy to reduce serum potassium during the treatment period was required by 2.1% of patients taking sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus 5.1% taking placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 7% and 8% of patients in sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo groups, respectively. The two groups displayed comparable interdialytic weight gain. There were few episodes of hypokalemia.

Conclusions

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for predialysis hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD undergoing adequate hemodialysis.

### Intermittent sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the prevention of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease [^2588282a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that often requires urgent dialysis and increases healthcare costs. Daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a safe and effective treatment for the control of serum potassium levels in CKD patients. We studied the efficacy and safety of intermittent SZC therapy for the prevention of hyperkalemia in CKD patients.

Methods

In a retrospective study, we analyzed patients in the Hospital Authority Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) receiving sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma ®) therapy once to thrice weekly for at least 3 months from January 2021 to June 2023. Outcome measures included plasma potassium levels, hyperkalemia episodes, hospital admissions, and renal function changes, which were compared to the 6 months period before the initiation of SZC treatment.

Results

We studied 36 adult CKD patients. SZC treatment significantly reduced plasma potassium levels from 5.10 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 4.91–5.40) to 4.73 (IQR 4.50–5.10) mmol/l (p = 0.0003). The median incidence of any hyperkalemia reduced from 5.0 (IQR 2.0–8.0) to 1.9 (IQR 0.0–4.7) episode per patient-year (p = 0.0001), and the incidence of urgent treatment for hyperkalemia decreased from 2.0 (IQR 0.0–4.0) to 0.0 (IQR 0.0–1.5) episode per patient-year (p = 0.007). The number of emergency room attendance and hospitalization were not significantly reduced.

Conclusion

Intermittent SZC treatment may help prevent hyperkalemia in CKD patients. Further research is necessary to ascertain if this benefit translates into improvements in hard clinical outcomes.

### Maintenance of serum potassium with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9) in heart failure patients: results from a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^79122233]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Safety

Adverse events were reported in 10 HF patients (10.6%) in the 48‐h open‐label phase; nausea and dizziness were the most common, occurring in two patients (2.1%) each. Adverse events occurring in two or more HF patients after randomization are presented in Table 2. The most commonly reported adverse event during the maintenance phase was oedema, occurring in one, two, and five patients in the 5 g, 10 g, and 15 g dose groups, respectively, and one patient in the placebo arm. Eight of the nine cases were peripheral oedema, four of which did not require treatment despite continued ZS‐9 dosing, and no patient discontinued the study because of oedema. Generalized oedema occurred in one patient with severe HF and a history of oedema requiring diuretic treatment. This occurrence of oedema was attributed to discontinuation of diuretics by the patient's family physician before initiation of the study. Six of the nine oedema patients entered the extension study, continuing once‐daily ZS‐9, and none have experienced new oedema (with 149 total exposure weeks). No patient receiving 15 g doses of ZS‐9 in the extension study has experienced oedema (with 278 total exposure weeks). Notably, the oedema rate in HF patients in the extension study is numerically lower than the oedema rate in HF patients on placebo during the randomized phase (0.00119 vs. 0.00132 oedema per day of exposure).

Table 2
Summary of all adverse events occurring in two or more patients in any treatment arm

Gastrointestinal events were reported in five patients (5.3%) during the open‐label phase. After randomization, GI events occurred in one patient (5.6%) in the 5 g dose group, none in the 10 g dose group, and three (12%) in the 15 g dose group, compared with five (19.2%) in the placebo group. No clinically significant cases of hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.0 mmol/L) or cardiac arrhythmias occurred. Laboratory analyses showed mild hypokalaemia (3.0 to < 3.5 mmol/L) occurring in one patient in the 10 g dose group and three patients in the 15 g dose group; each case resolved with protocol‐directed dose adjustments. None of the cases of hypokalaemia were reported as adverse events. There were no treatment‐related serious adverse events in any ZS‐9 dose groups.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

The following tests for mutagenic potential of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate were negative: (1) the Ames (S. typhimurium and E. coli) test; (2) chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells; and (3) in vivo rat micronucleus assay. Given that zirconium cyclosilicate is not genotoxic, not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and did not cause local gastrointestinal alterations in a chronic toxicity study in dogs, carcinogenicity studies in animals to evaluate tumorigenic potential of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate were not deemed to be necessary.

Fertility in male and female rats has been assessed at doses up to a Human Equivalent Dose (HED) of 58 g per day (the maximum feasible dose) with no adverse effects.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^2158a912]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post hoc analysis demonstrated that SZC reduces serum K + levels in patients with baseline serum K + levels of ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. Furthermore, in this patient population, a single treatment with SZC 10 g reduced serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose. Treatment with SZC 10 g TID resulted in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose. These trends held true for all baseline serum K + strata. In addition, SZC 10 g demonstrated a safety profile consistent with that observed in prior studies.

A single-dose treatment with SZC 10 g reduced mean serum K + levels within 1 h of the initial dose by 0.27 mmol/L in patients with a baseline serum K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. In general, the most marked reductions in serum K + levels were observed in patients with the highest serum K + level at baseline in previous studies, which was confirmed in the present analysis. Nearly two-thirds (65.5%) of all patients with moderate to severe hyperkalemia achieved serum K + level ≤ 5.1 mmol/L within 24 h in the present study, which was achieved by 84% of the overall patient population in the same time period in the HARMONIZE trial. This trend was further reflected in the median time to serum K + level ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, where patients in the overall population of the HARMONIZE trial demonstrated normalized serum K + levels in 2.2 h. This corresponded with a median time of 21.6 h in the current analysis, which is expected for a patient population with a higher mean baseline serum K + level than that observed in the HARMONIZE trial.

### HARMONIZE Asia: a phase III randomized study to investigate the efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with hyperkalemia in China [^bd8fa0fe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is an oral potassium (K +)-lowering therapy for adults with hyperkalemia. HARMONIZE Asia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03528681) evaluated the efficacy and safety of SZC in Chinese patients with hyperkalemia.

Methods

This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study recruited patients with serum K + (sK +) ≥ 5.1 mmol/L at 35 sites in China. Patients received SZC 10 g three times daily (TID) for 24 or 48 hours during an open-label initial phase (OLP). Those patients achieving normokalemia (sK + 3.5–5.0 mmol/L inclusive) entered a 28-day randomized (2:2:1) treatment phase (RTP) and received SZC 5 g, SZC 10 g, or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was mean sK + during RTP Days 8 to 29. Secondary endpoints included mean change in sK + during the OLP, the proportion of patients who achieved normokalemia at the end of the OLP, the proportion that maintained normokalemia during the RTP, and time to recurrence of hyperkalemia.

Findings

In total, 270 patients received SZC 10 g TID during the OLP; 256 (94.8%) completed the OLP. During the OLP, mean sK + decreased by 1.1 mmol/L from baseline (5.9 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and 87.4% of patients achieved normokalemia. During the RTP, SZC 5 g and 10 g reduced mean sK + versus placebo in a dose-dependent manner (each P < 0.001); least-squares means (95% confidence interval [CI]) sK + were 4.9 mmol/L (4.7, 5.0), 4.4 mmol/L (4.3, 4.6), and 5.2 mmol/L (5.1, 5.4) for SZC 5 g, 10 g, and placebo, respectively. At RTP end, the proportions of patients who maintained normokalemia were 58.8% (SZC 5 g; odds ratio vs placebo, 2.5 [95% CI: 1.1, 6.1; P = 0.035]), 76.5% (SZC 10 g; odds ratio vs placebo, 6.3 [95% CI: 2.6, 15.3; P < 0.001]), and 36.8% for placebo. Risk of recurrent hyperkalemia was reduced by 61.0% and 84.0% with SZC 5 g and SZC 10 g, respectively, versus placebo (each P < 0.001). During the RTP, the incidence of adverse events was numerically higher with SZC 5 g (50.0% of patients) and 10 g (44.0%) versus placebo (36.0%); driven primarily by peripheral edema and constipation.

Implications

Both SZC doses demonstrated clinically relevant and statistically significant, dose-dependent efficacy in managing sK + levels in Chinese patients with hyperkalemia, compared with placebo. SZC tolerability was broadly aligned with the known safety profile of SZC.

### Management of hyperkalemia in chronic heart failure using sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [^fac8a763]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperkalemia (generally defined as serum potassium level > 5.0 mEq/L) is often present in chronic heart failure due to concomitant chronic kidney disease. Its presence often limits up‐titration of guideline‐directed medical therapies and indirectly may affect long‐term clinical risk.

Recently, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), a non‐absorbed, non‐polymer zirconium silicate compound that exchanges hydrogen and sodium for potassium and ammonium ions in the gastrointestinal tract, has been clinically available to treat hyperkalemia. A loading dose with 30 g per day of SZC is generally recommended as initial 2‐day therapy. If post‐treatment hypokalemia that sometimes triggers cardiac arrhythmia is worried, a maintenance dose with 5 g per day of SZC might be preferred.

Appropriate usage of SZC would be essential for the management of hyperkalemia and successful administration and up‐titration of renin‐angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, preventing fatal abnormality in the serum potassium level. In this study, we investigated (1) the actual degree of reduction in serum potassium levels following the 2‐day SZC therapy with both loading and maintenance dose in a representative heart failure cohort (efficacy analysis) and (2) factors associating with hypokalemia following the 2‐day SZC therapy (safety analysis).

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for management of hyperkalemia during spironolactone optimization in patients with heart Failure [^a6dd3f30]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but are underused in clinical practice. Observational data suggest that hyperkalemia is the leading obstacle for the suboptimal use of MRA.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effects of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) in optimizing use of spironolactone among participants with HFrEF and hyperkalemia.

Methods

REALIZE-K (Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of SZC for the Management of High Potassium in Patients With Symptomatic HFrEF Receiving Spironolactone) was a prospective, double-blind, randomized- withdrawal trial in participants with HFrEF (NYHA functional class II-IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), optimal guideline-directed therapy (except MRA), and prevalent or incident MRA-induced hyperkalemia. During open-label run-in, participants underwent spironolactone titration (target: 50 mg/day); those with hyperkalemia started SZC. Participants with normokalemia (potassium: 3.5–5.0 mEq/L) on SZC and spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day were randomized to continued SZC or placebo for 6 months. The primary endpoint was optimal treatment response (normokalemia on spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day without rescue therapy for hyperkalemia [months 1–6]). The 5 secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically. Exploratory endpoints included a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure (HF) events (hospitalizations and urgent visits).

Results

Overall, 203 participants were randomized (SZC: 102; placebo: 101). Higher percentage of SZC- vs placebo-treated participants had optimal response (71% vs 36%; OR: 4.45; 95% CI: 2.89–6.86; P < 0.001). SZC (vs placebo) improved the first 4 secondary endpoints: normokalemia on randomization dose of spironolactone and without rescue therapy (58% vs 23%; OR: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.78–7.55; P < 0.001); receiving spironolactone ≥ 25 mg/day (81% vs 50%; OR: 4.33; 95% CI: 2.50–7.52; P < 0.001); time to hyperkalemia (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.37–0.71; P < 0.001); and time to decrease/discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17–0.73; P = 0.006). There was no between-group difference in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score at 6 months (-1.01 points; 95% CI: -6.64 to 4.63; P = 0.72). Adverse events (64% vs 63%) and serious adverse events (23% vs 22%) were balanced between SZC and placebo, respectively. Composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or worsening HF occurred in 11 (11%) participants in the SZC group (1 with CV death, 10 with HF events) and 3 (3%) participants in the placebo group (1 with CV death, 2 with HF events; log-rank nominal P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In participants with HFrEF and hyperkalemia, SZC led to large improvements in the percentage of participants with normokalemia while on optimal spironolactone dose, and reduced risk of hyperkalemia and down-titration/discontinuation of spironolactone. Although underpowered for clinical outcomes, more participants had HF events with SZC than placebo, which should be factored into the clinical decision making.

### Cost effectiveness of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD in Norway and Sweden [^ce4101d6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is an electrolyte abnormality defined as a serum potassium (K +) level above the normal physiological range of 3.5–5.0 mmol/L. As renal secretion is the main route of potassium elimination, patients with renal and metabolic comorbidities are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Mild hyperkalaemia is usually asymptomatic, however even modestly raised serum K + (5.0–5.5 mmol/L) is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This risk profile may partly be compounded by the relationship between renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and hyperkalaemia. International and national guidelines recommend RAASi as first-line agents to delay CKD progression and to lower risks of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, despite these benefits, RAASi – which comprise angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) – can cause hyperkalaemia. Therefore, RAASi therapy is frequently downtitrated or discontinued in patients who experience hyperkalaemia, contributing to significant discrepancies between guideline recommendations and real-world practice regarding RAASi treatment. Failure to achieve guideline-recommended doses of RAASi has been associated with adverse outcomes. Thus, there is an established need for safe and effective treatment of hyperkalaemia, in particular to permit maintenance of RAASi therapy.

Although there is a well-defined treatment pathway for acute, life-threatening hyperkalaemia (K + > 7 mmol/L or with serious ECG changes) in the inpatient setting, management regimes and thresholds for intervention for chronic hyperkalaemia are varied, typically region specific, and may suffer from significant limitations. In general, management of chronic hyperkalaemia comprises a combination of limiting K + intake through dietary modification, preventing K + retention by down-titration or discontinuation of medications such as RAASi, and the use of oral K + binders to facilitate K + excretion via the gastrointestinal route. Until recently, oral K + binders were limited to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), which is used in both the inpatient and outpatient setting in Sweden, and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS), which is used in Norway, however the efficacies of SPS and CPS are uncertain and they are associated with adverse events (AEs).

Potassium exchange agents — sodium- or calcium-polystyrene sulfonates (SPS/CPS), patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) — are contrasted for dosing, onset, administration timing, and adverse effects. SPS/CPS dosing is Oral: 15–60 g/d (up to 4 times per day) and Rectal: 30 g/d (for SPS up to a maximum of 50 g/d), with maintenance 15–60 g/d orally per day depending on potassium level and level of tolerability; onset is variable, hours to days, and duration is variable, 6–24 hours. Patiromer dosing is Initial: 8.4 g orally once per day (maximum 25.2 g orally once per day); dose can be increased by 8.4 g increments at 1-week intervals, with maintenance 8.4–25.2 g orally once per day. SZC dosing is Initial: 10 g orally 3 times per day for up to 48 hours, with maintenance 5 g every second day to 10 g once per day; it starts to reduce potassium within 1 hour with normokalemia typically at 24–48 hours. Administration timing includes separating SPS/CPS from oral medications by at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after administration and, if gastroparesis, separating other medications by 6 hours; SZC should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after oral medicinal products with clinically meaningful gastric pH-dependent bioavailability. Adverse effects for SPS/CPS include GI events and potentially serious GI adverse events (intestinal necrosis, bleeding, ischemic colitis, and perforation).

### Management of hyperkalemia in chronic heart failure using sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [^45302c21]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

SZC is a promising therapeutic option that immediately decreases approximately 1.0 mEq/L of serum potassium in patients with heart failure and hyperkalemia. However, caution should be exercised when utilizing SZC at a loading dose specifically in those with mild hyperkalemia. A maintenance dose, instead of loading dose, would be recommended in such a cohort as an initial dose.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, the phase II ENERGIZE study is the first of its kind to evaluate the efficacy of SZC, a novel and highly selective potassium binder, in the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia. This pilot study was based on a patient population requiring emergency treatment for hyperkalemia, for whom achievement of normokalemia in a relatively short period of time is important to reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality.

Overall, we found a similar reduction in sK + at 4 hours with SZC and placebo, with a small advantage in the SZC group at 2 hours. The similar reduction in sK + observed with SZC at 1 hour suggests that at 1 hour the potassium‐lowering effect of the background insulin and glucose treatment is dominant. The greater reduction in sK + observed with SZC compared with placebo at 2 hours may reflect the rapid biological effect of SZC, which has been shown consistently in clinical trials to lower sK + as early as 1 hour after administration. 22, 23, 24 Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients were missing central laboratory potassium measurements at 4 hours, which reduced the ability to detect treatment differences at this time point.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate showed numerical improvements compared with placebo for a number of other outcomes. We recently reported that none of the medical treatments employed in the management of hyperkalemia in U.S. EDs, except for dialysis, results in a median sK + of < 5.0 mmol/L at 4 hours. 7 Correspondingly, in this study, low numbers of patients in both groups achieved normokalemia (sK + 3.5–5.0 mmol/L). However, a numerically greater proportion of patients receiving SZC achieved sK + < 6.0 mmol/L during the study period compared with placebo. Another important finding is that a numerically lower proportion of patients in the SZC group required additional potassium‐lowering therapy due to hyperkalemia compared with placebo, despite similar reductions from baseline in sK + at 4 hours between treatment groups. However, the present study did not consider potential differences in the dosing of additional therapy between treatment groups, and additional therapy use was at the discretion of each clinical site investigator; therefore, the effect of these factors on the rates of additional therapy use is unclear. Overall, our study findings suggest a signal indicative of an incremental benefit of SZC when added to insulin and glucose in managing the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hyperkalaemia, and spironolactone optimization in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the REALIZE-K open-label run-in phase [^d6f3a75d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce mortality and HF hospitalizations, and are one of the key cornerstones of guideline‐directed medical therapy. Hyperkalaemia (or fear of hyperkalaemia) is a major reason for their underuse. In the randomized‐withdrawal phase of the REALIZE‐K trial, of patients with HFrEF and prevalent hyperkalaemia or at risk of hyperkalaemia, continued use of the potassium (K +) binder sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) led to large increases in the number of participants on optimal‐dose spironolactone with normokalaemia, and reduced the risk of hyperkalaemia and down‐titration/discontinuation of spironolactone compared with withdrawal to placebo. Prior to the placebo‐controlled, randomized‐withdrawal phase of REALIZE‐K, there was a run‐in phase in which SZC was used to manage hyperkalaemia and spironolactone dose was optimized.

This analysis evaluated the efficacy of SZC in lowering serum (s)K + and enabling SZC titration during the run‐in phase among those with prevalent hyperkalaemia on no or low‐dose (12.5 mg) spironolactone; and in those identified as at high risk of hyperkalaemia on no or low‐dose spironolactone, to evaluate the incidence of hyperkalaemia during spironolactone dose titration during the run‐in phase and use of SZC to lower sK + and enable maintenance of spironolactone.

### The LIFT trial: study protocol for a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of K-binder lokelma for maximisation of RAAS inhibition in CKD patients with heart failure [^2590b12c]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have shown that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) can lower serum potassium concentrations in non-CKD, CKD, and HF populations. SZC is a zirconium silicate compound that acts as a selective potassium ion trap and is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In a phase three randomised controlled trial of 258 patients with hyperkalaemia, SZC lowered serum potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mmol/L in 48 h and maintained serum potassium of < 5.1 mmol/L in 90% of patients (compared with 48% of patients on placebo, p < 0.001).

Most studies of potassium binders have been short and none have investigated exclusively the high-risk group of patients with advanced CKD-HF, particularly with an aim to maximise RAASi therapy. Furthermore, this study will augment the currently-limited safety and efficacy data on RAASi maximisation in advanced CKD patients.

The St George's experience suggests the need for a trial and subsequent clinical implementation of RAASi maximisation in patients with combined CKD-HF. There are significant numbers of patients in our own clinics who may benefit from recruitment into a trial of RAASi maximisation. We therefore propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the potential benefits of SZC in patients with CKD and HF on maximisation of RAASi therapy.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — potassium exchange agents dosing and administration are contrasted for polystyrene sulfonates, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC). For polystyrene sulfonates, oral dosing is 15–60 g/d (up to 4 times per day) and rectal dosing is 30 g/d (for SPS up to a maximum of 50 g/d). Patiromer initial dosing is 8.4 g orally once per day (maximum 25.2 g orally once per day) with titration by 8.4 g increments at 1-week intervals, and maintenance dosing is 8.4–25.2 g orally once per day. SZC initial dosing is 10 g orally 3 times per day for up to 48 hours with maintenance 5 g every second day to 10 g once per day; it starts to reduce potassium within 1 hour with normokalemia typically at 24–48 hours. Administration separation is as follows: for polystyrene sulfonates, separate from oral medications by at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after administration, and if gastroparesis, separate other medications by 6 hours; for patiromer, separate from oral medications by at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after administration; for SZC, it should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after oral medicinal products with clinically meaningful gastric pH-dependent bioavailability. Reported adverse effects include for polystyrene sulfonates gastrointestinal events and electrolyte disturbances with potentially serious gastrointestinal adverse events, and for SZC hypokalemia and edema events are most common with milder reports of nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.

### Single dose of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus sodium polystyrene sulfonate in hospitalized patients with hyperkalemia [^81efb397]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is an inorganic zirconium silicate compound that selectively exchanges potassium for hydrogen and sodium. "Once" doses of SZC (with option to redose) in patients with hyperkalemia in hospitalized settings have not been evaluated. We hypothesized that a once dose of SZC would be non-inferior to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) in reducing serum potassium.

Objective

The objective of our study is to evaluate the effect of a "once" dose of SZC when compared with SPS in reducing serum potassium levels.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients who received either a "once" dose of SZC or single or repeated doses of SPS for hyperkalemia. The primary endpoint was mean absolute reduction in the first serum potassium value at least 4 hours after administration. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the rate of additional potassium-lowering therapies and the rate of normokalemia within 48 hours. Safety endpoints were the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, hypertension, hypotension, and colonic necrosis.

Results

A total of 260 patients were included in the analysis. The mean initial serum potassium was similar between groups (5.6 ± 0.4). The absolute serum potassium reduction was -0.88 ± 0.64 mEq/L and -0.75 ± 0.65 mEq/L with SZC and SPS, respectively. The "once" regimen of SZC demonstrated non-inferiority compared with SPS (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients achieving normokalemia within 48 hours and the proportion of patients receiving additional potassium-lowering therapies did not differ between groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

The "once" dose regimen (with redose option) of SZC was non-inferior to the "once" or repeated dosing regimen of SPS with regard to absolute potassium reduction. There were no significant differences in the rate of additional potassium-lowering therapies and the rate of normokalemia at 48 hours. The incidence of hypertension was less common among patients who received SZC.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^314b0136]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte abnormality associated with poor clinical outcomes, cardiac dysrhythmias, increased mortality, and higher use of healthcare resources. Despite the potential for devastating sequelae, the threshold for and means of treating hyperkalemia vary in clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia therapies (e.g. intravenous insulin and glucose or inhaled β2 agonists) typically used in the emergency department and other acute care settings to lower serum potassium (K +) are temporary in nature and impractical for ongoing outpatient use. Although acute dialysis may be used in select patients for the immediate treatment of hyperkalemia, this procedure is invasive and costly, presents logistical challenges, and may require an inpatient admission. While nonspecific cation-exchange resins (e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate [SPS] and patiromer) are adequately suited for the outpatient setting, they have been associated with questionable tolerability or a slow onset of action. Therefore, there remains a need for more reliable treatment options for patients with hyperkalemia that allow for rapid and safe reduction of K + values.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is an oral, nonabsorbed, high-capacity cation-binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract. SZC is thought to start binding potassium in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which most likely accounts for its rapid onset of action (AstraZeneca, unpublished observations). In clinical studies of patients with hyperkalemia, SZC has been shown to reduce serum K + levels within 1 h of administration. SZC is currently approved for the treatment of patients with hyperkalemia in the United States (US) and the European Union. The current analysis examined the efficacy and safety of SZC for up to 48 h among patients with moderate to severe hyperkalemia (baseline serum K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L). These results may have potential implications for treating patients with moderate to severe hyperkalemia that is not immediately life-threatening.

### Potassium responses to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients: post-hoc analysis of DIALIZE [^861c2701]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

The full details of the DIALIZE study (NCT03303521) have been presented previously. Briefly, DIALIZE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study conducted across Japan, Russia, the US, and the UK. The study consisted of a 1-week screening period, an 8-week treatment period comprising 4 weeks for SZC dose titration and 4 weeks for evaluation on stable dose, and a 2-week follow-up period. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive orally a starting dose of 5 g of SZC or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days (4 days/week). All patients received hemodialysis three times weekly and routine dietary counseling as per local guidelines, including dietary potassium restriction. During dose titration, doses of SZC and placebo were adjusted weekly over 4 weeks to achieve and maintain a pre-dialysis sK + concentration of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L after the LIDI. Doses of SZC and placebo were titrated in 5 g increments to a maximum dose of 15 g once daily on non-dialysis days (4 days/week).

Eligible patients were adults aged ≥ 18 years with ESKD who were managed for ≥ 3 months before randomization by hemodialysis three times weekly. During screening, patients were required to have hyperkalemia despite maintenance hemodialysis, defined as pre-dialysis sK + > 5.4 mmol/L after the LIDI on day − 7 and pre-dialysis sK + > 5.0 mmol/L after ≥ 1 SIDI on days − 5 and − 3.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^ef2dd1f6]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Orally available therapeutic options for hyperkalemia, including cation-binding compounds to eliminate K +, have been in use since the late 1950s. SPS and patiromer are the only other K + -binding resins currently approved for clinical use in the United States. However, there is limited evidence to support their efficacy and safety in the acute treatment of patients with serum K + level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. SPS was approved for use in the United States in the absence of robust clinical trial evidence to support drug efficacy. SPS has a slow onset of action and poor predictability in its ability to decrease serum K + levels, and is, therefore, not indicated for the acute treatment of severe hyperkalemia. In addition, SPS and patiromer have been associated with gastrointestinal-related AEs.

There are several limitations of this study. This post hoc analysis lacked a placebo control and included a limited number of patients with a serum K + level ≥ 6.0 mmol/L (n = 45). The phase 3 studies were performed in an outpatient population, which may have limited the number of patients with more severe hyperkalemia. The current analysis focused only on the correction phase of treatment. While both phase 3 studies included maintenance-phase treatment periods, those data could not be pooled for additional analysis because of differences in study designs. Further studies in the acute setting (e.g. emergency department and the hospital), in patients undergoing dialysis, and those that evaluate the impact of treatment on readmission rates are merited. Additional studies that evaluate follow-up care and the ability to safely maintain K + values after acute care management are also warranted. Given the mechanism of action of SZC, we do not expect a difference in the treatment response between men and women. Further analysis would need to be carried out to verify this more formally.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in the management of hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease treated with spironolactone: rationale for and design of the REGISTA-K trial [^ed22b689]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate whether sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) enables the up-titration of spironolactone without increasing the risk of hyper- and hypokalemia in patients with heart failure with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFmrEF) and moderate/severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) who developed hyperkalemia during treatment with suboptimal spironolactone dose.

Methods

The REGISTA-K is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that examined the efficacy and safety of SZC in up-titrating spironolactone without the occurrence of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia. A total of 266 patients with HFrEF and HFmrEF and hyperkalemia will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SZC or placebo after treating hyperkalemia with SZC at 25 sites in Japan. The study enrolls patients with left ventricular EF < 50%, moderate/severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2), serum potassium level > 5.0 mEq/L, and undergoing 12.5–37.5 mg spironolactone treatment. The primary endpoint is successful administration of 50 mg/day spironolactone at 16 weeks follow-up without the need for rescue therapy for either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

REGISTA-K will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SZC as adjunctive therapy in up-titrating spironolactone in patients with HFrEF and HFmrEF with moderate to severe renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia.

### Effectiveness of patiromer versus sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the management of acute hyperkalemia [^512bb139]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) are 2 oral potassium binders approved for chronic hyperkalemia. It is unknown if one is more effective at reducing serum potassium than the other in acute hyperkalemia.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine if there was a difference between patiromer and SZC in the reduction of serum potassium in patients with acute hyperkalemia.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients with a nonhemolyzed serum potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L or greater and received at least one dose of patiromer or SZC were included. The primary outcome was to determine the difference in effectiveness between patiromer and SZC in lowering of serum potassium 6 to 24 hours after administration. Secondary outcomes included description of total dosage received in 24 hours and incidence of electrolyte changes.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study, with 100 patients in each group. Serum potassium was significantly reduced by both patiromer (-1.2 mEq/L, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.3 to -0.2) and SZC (-0.8 mEq/L, 95% CI: -1.0 to -0.7), but there was no difference between the 2 medications in the amount of potassium reduction (P = 0.464). No clinically significant differences in electrolyte changes were seen.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study represents the first head-to-head comparison of patiromer and SZC in the setting of acute hyperkalemia. No difference in effectiveness between patiromer and SZC in reducing serum potassium was seen. Both agents can be considered in acute hyperkalemia management.

Commentary and clinical utility — dietary counseling and medication review are advocated as adjuncts to hyperkalemia management, and the KDOQI Work Group suggests considering the use of new potassium binders rather than stopping RAS inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, with short-term sodium polystyrene sulfonate as an alternative in underresourced settings after attempts to obtain new binders. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are described as advantageous because they do not require three-times-daily administration like sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and strategies to maintain normal potassium include dietary adjustments, adjusting diuretic doses, and/or utilizing SGLT2 inhibitors; clinicians should also review herbal and prescribed products that can raise potassium and increase monitoring when indicated.

Abstract

Background

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), a newly‐developed selective potassium binder, has been clinically available to treat hyperkalemia. SZC might be a promising option to manage hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with heart failure, who often require potassium‐sparing medications. However, the optimal initial dose of SZC therapy at a loading dose (30 g per day for the initial 2 days) versus a maintenance dose (5 g per day) remains unknown.

Methods

Consecutive patients with heart failure and hyperkalemia who received 2‐day SZC therapy were retrospectively included. Safety and efficacy of SZC therapy were compared between the two strategies (maintenance versus loading).

Results

We had 16 patients (76 years old, 11 men) who received 2‐day SZC therapy (4 maintenance dose group and 12 loading dose group). Serum potassium decreased 0.7 mEqL/L by 2‐day maintenance dose therapy and 1.3 mEq/L by 2‐day loading dose therapy. Following 2‐day SZC therapy, 25% of patients had hypokalemia, which was defined as serum potassium < 4.0 mEq/L. Baseline lower serum potassium level was associated with the post‐SZC hypokalemia.

Conclusions

SZC immediately decreases approximately 1.0 mEq/L of serum potassium in patients with heart failure and hyperkalemia. However, caution should be exercised when utilizing SZC at a loading dose specifically in those with mild hyperkalemia to prevent iatrogenic hypokalemia.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate increases serum bicarbonate concentrations among patients with hyperkalaemia: exploratory analyses from three randomized, multi-dose, placebo-controlled trials [^a3500e6a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with serum bicarbonate increases, SZC also reduced frequencies of serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L that were maintained over time. The proportions of patients receiving SZC with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L at Day 29 was lower in HARMONIZE (17.2%) than in HARMONIZE-Global (77.6%) due to the differences in the proportion of patients with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L at CP baseline between these studies (39.4% and 87.9%, respectively). Consistent with these reductions in proportions with serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L, SZC treatment was associated with dose-dependent decreases in serum urea and increases in urine pH in all three studies.

The mechanisms underlying the increase in serum bicarbonate with SZC are not fully understood, but may be due to the binding and removal of ammonium by SZC in the gastrointestinal tract, or to augmentation of renal ammoniagenesis through correction of hyperkalaemia. Ammonium ions have similar biophysical properties to K + ions in aqueous solution; thus, SZC demonstrates significant binding of ammonium ions in addition to K + in the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the release of hydrogen as one of the SZC exchange ions, paradoxically SZC increases serum bicarbonate and corrects acidosis compared with placebo. This suggests that although SZC exchanges hydrogen and sodium for K +, SZC must mostly exchange sodium for ammonium and not hydrogen for ammonium, which would otherwise release a stronger acid while binding a weaker one. Urea in the gastrointestinal tract is hydrolysed by bacterial ureases to release bicarbonate and ammonium ions, which are absorbed through the gastrointestinal epithelium and enter the liver, where urea is resynthesized. Thus, capture of ammonium by SZC in exchange for sodium ions, with subsequent elimination of ammonium in the faeces, interrupts the ammonium component of this enterohepatic loop. This allows bicarbonate to be reabsorbed while reducing the reabsorption of ammonium, which, in turn, reduces the substrate available for resynthesis of urea in the liver. The overall effect is an increase in serum bicarbonate, reduction in serum urea and net acid loss.

Effects of SZC on serum urea

Acute effects

Dose-dependent decreases in serum urea occurred within 48 h following SZC administration versus placebo in ZS-003 (Supplementary data, Figure S6; P < 0.05 versus placebo for SZC 5 g TID and 10 g TID doses).

Maintenance of effects

Serum urea decreases from baseline during the CPs were maintained during the MPs with an SZC dose of 15 g QD in HARMONIZE (Supplementary data, Figure S7A) and 5 g and 10 g QD in HARMONIZE-Global (Supplementary data, Figure S7B); the mixed model derived 15- to 29-day LS mean changes from baseline were significantly decreased versus placebo for the SZC 10 g QD dose in HARMONIZE (Table 3) and for the SZC 5 g and 10 g QD doses in HARMONIZE-Global (Table 3). Among patients randomized to receive placebo and SZC doses of 5 g in HARMONIZE and patients randomized to receive placebo in HARMONIZE-Global during the MPs, serum urea returned to pre-treatment levels (Supplementary data, Figure S7A and S7B).

Effects of SZC on urine pH

Acute effects

An increase in urine pH occurred within 48 h following SZC administration versus placebo in ZS-003 with the SZC 10 g TID dose (Supplementary data, Figures S8; P < 0.001 versus placebo); a small decrease from baseline in the placebo group also occurred.

Maintenance of effects

Urine pH increases from baseline during the CPs were maintained during the MPs with an SZC dose of 15 g QD in HARMONIZE (Supplementary data, Figure S9A) and 5 g and 10 g QD in HARMONIZE-Global (Supplementary data, Figure S9B); the mixed model derived 15- to 29-day LS mean changes from baseline were significantly increased versus placebo for the SZC 10 g and 15 g QD doses in HARMONIZE (Table 3) and for the SZC 5 g and 10 g QD doses in HARMONIZE-Global (Table 3). Among patients randomized to receive placebo or SZC 5 g QD or during the MPs of both studies, urine pH either returned to pre-treatment levels or fell below baseline levels (Supplementary data, Figure S9). Changes in urine pH during the MP with the SZC 10 g dose in HARMONIZE were difficult to interpret because at randomization, this group had a greater reduction in urine pH pre-randomization by chance (Supplementary data, Figure S9A).

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with baseline serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mmol / L: pooled analysis from two phase 3 trials [^420f789c]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The safety profile of SZC 10 g TID demonstrated in the current patient population was generally consistent with that observed in the overall populations who received SZC during the two phase 3 trials. The most common AEs experienced by patients in this analysis were gastrointestinal-related disorders (2.9%), with constipation being the most frequent gastrointestinal AE (1.8%). In the HARMONIZE study, the most common AE was edema, and in the ZS-003 study, the most common AE in both placebo and SZC treatment groups was diarrhea.

The clinical and economic burden of hyperkalemia is well known. In a recent analysis of the cost of hyperkalemia in the United States (N = 39,626 patients with hyperkalemia and an equal number of matched controls), patients with hyperkalemia incurred $4128 higher 30-day healthcare costs than matched controls ($5994 vs. $1866, respectively). A review of 911,698 medical records across the US demonstrated that, in the absence of known cardiovascular disease, diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, mortality was shown to be 7.5-fold higher in individuals with K + levels of 5.5–8.0 mmol/L vs. those with K + levels of 4.0– < 5.0 mmol/L. In a cohort study of more than 55,000 patients with chronic kidney disease not undergoing dialysis, serum K + levels of ≥ 6.0 mmol/L were associated with a higher risk of death, major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and discontinuations of RAASi therapy. Elevated K + was the cause of approximately 67,000 visits to US emergency departments during 2011, with 50% of these visits resulting in hospital admissions. The average length of stay associated with a hyperkalemia admission was 3.2 days, with an estimated cost of $24,178. Among Medicare beneficiaries, total annual hospital expenditures for admissions with hyperkalemia as the primary diagnosis totaled nearly $700 million. More recent US data in 2014 demonstrated that patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia accrued an average length of stay of 3.3 days and a mean cost of $29,181 per stay, for an estimated total annual hospital charge of $1.2 billion. New hyperkalemia treatment options may have the potential to positively impact healthcare resource utilization.

### Effects of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on the quality of life of patients with hyperkalemia undergoing hemodialysis: Y-QOL study design [^137da91c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) contributes significantly to global morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 700 million people affected worldwide, as of 2017. As CKD progresses to its most advanced stage, patients often require maintenance dialysis therapy to help manage their condition; however, this can also pose significant challenges in terms of controlling fluid balance and electrolyte levels, especially potassium. Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are prone to hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest, especially if potassium levels exceed 6.5 mEq/L. Such cases require immediate intervention, typically involving changes to dialysis regimens, increased dialysis frequency, and the use of other medications, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, insulin/glucose, and beta-stimulants. Notably, however, even HD patients without critically high potassium levels may face dietary restrictions to manage their potassium intake. The standard advice is to limit potassium intake to ≤ 2000 mg/day, with the aim of maintaining serum potassium levels at 4.0–5.5 mEq/L.

This dietary restriction requires reducing the intake of high-potassium foods such as fruit and vegetables, which can have a significant impact on patient quality of life (QOL). These restrictions may result in a less colorful and flavorful diet, causing dissatisfaction among patients undergoing HD. Furthermore, reduced dietary fiber can also lead to constipation, further affecting patient comfort and well-being. This burden of dietary restrictions may result in reduced QOL and undernutrition if patients consume fewer nutrients and calories. Regular check-ups by healthcare professionals to monitor dietary compliance can also increase stress and reduce patient satisfaction. Finding a suitable balance between managing hyperkalemia and maintaining a reasonable QOL is a significant challenge for patients with CKD undergoing HD. Potassium-binding agents, such as calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate, can help manage hyperkalemia. However, they often require frequent doses, can interfere with the absorption of other electrolytes, and frequently cause constipation. These issues lead to low tolerability and patient dissatisfaction, particularly with long-term use. Furthermore, the potassium-binding capacity of these agents may be limited, as suggested by findings from observational studies of sodium polystyrene sulfonate in patients with hyperkalemia. In addition, the risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including intestinal necrosis, has been reported, and medium- to long-term use is generally not recommended.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated the change in serum potassium level following 2‐day SZC therapy in patients with chronic heart failure and hyperkalemia. Our main findings were: (1) Serum potassium decreased approximately 0.7 mEqL/L by 2‐day maintenance dose therapy (5 g per day) and approximately 1.3 mEq/L by 2‐day loading dose therapy (30 g per day) (efficacy analysis); (2) 25% of patients suffered hypokalemia (defined as serum potassium < 4.0 mEq/L) following 2‐day SZC therapy. A baseline lower serum potassium level was associated with the development of post‐SZC hypokalemia (safety analysis).

4.1 Efficacy of

The HARMONIZE phase III double‐blind randomized control study demonstrated that a 2‐day SZC therapy at a loading dose decreased 1.28 mEq/L of serum potassium level. This study included only 19% of heart failure patients. The efficacy of SZC might differ in heart failure populations due to the presence of therapies which directly modulate potassium absorption and excretion. In this study of patients with heart failure, we confirmed that the average decrease in serum potassium was similar to the HARMONIZE results (−1.3 mEq/L in the loading group). We notably observed a reduced efficacy of the maintenance dose compared to the loading dose. The finding should be useful to determine which strategy (loading or maintenance) to choose as an initial dose considering the target serum potassium level.

Hyperkalemia represents a common and potentially life-threating electrolyte abnormality, a complication frequently observed in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes or in those receiving drug therapies influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Elevated serum potassium levels are often the result of impaired urinary potassium elimination, inadequate or reduced cellular potassium uptake, severe heart failure, use of medications influencing potassium levels in the circulation, or, more commonly, a combination of these factors. Strategies for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia include the use of cation-exchange resins, polymers or other novel mechanisms of potassium trapping, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These agents differ in their pharmacology and mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, including onset and extent of potassium-lowering effect, dosage and administration, and potential safety and adverse effect profiles. In this review, an evaluation of these characteristics, including clinical evidence and safety concerns, in the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia will be explored.

### Potassium responses to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients: post-hoc analysis of DIALIZE [^74e0d20e]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recently, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommended further research determining the efficacy of newer agents in patients with ESKD receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We used data from the phase 3b DIALIZE study to further investigate the spectrum of potassium responses with SZC in maintenance hemodialysis patients with hyperkalemia. SZC was associated with a greater proportion of patients achieving clinically recommended or acceptable pre-dialysis sK + ranges and lower potassium gradient during the evaluation period versus placebo.

Our findings extend those previously reported in the phase 3b DIALIZE study regarding control of sK + with SZC. We assessed control of hyperkalemia using a pre-dialysis sK + range of 4.0–5.0 mmol/L and an extended range of 4.0–5.5 mmol/L. Although UK clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining a pre-dialysis sK + concentration of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L, previous analyses have shown that sK + concentrations of ≥ 5.6 mmol/L are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and ≥ 5.5 mmol/L is associated with hospitalization. For many physicians and patients, achieving and maintaining a pre-dialysis sK + concentration of 4.0–5.5 mmol/L would be considered a successful response in hemodialysis patients with hyperkalemia, while preventing patients from being exposed to the risks associated with sK + > 5.5 mmol/L. In our analyses, regardless of the sK + range used, SZC was associated with greater control of sK + versus placebo. Using the extended range of 4.0–5.5 mmol/L, nearly half of the patients receiving SZC achieved and maintained the sK + range at all 4 LIDI visits over a 4-week period. Some reduction from baseline in sK + was observed with placebo, which may be attributable to some patients having temporary increases in sK + or to a change in patient behavior such as an increased compliance to diet restrictions.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to increase lithium elimination [^02e88281]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Lithium is considered a mood stabilizer for bipolar affective disorders, but it has a narrow therapeutic index of 0.6–1.2 mEq/L. This can easily result in toxic levels after minimal changes in renal function or individual patient's pharmacokinetics. Lithium toxicity can arise with levels as low as 1.5 mEq, and there are limited therapeutic options to treat these patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). At therapeutic levels 95% of lithium is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys. However, previous literature has examined sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) as an option to reduce lithium levels by binding the lithium cation and enhancing its excretion via the gastrointestinal tract. This suggests there may be an increased degree of non-renal clearance and altered toxicokinetics at supratherapeutic levels. However, SPS has been associated with intestinal necrosis and may cause treatment limiting hypokalemia, and is therefore not commonly recommended in treatment algorithms for lithium toxicity. A newer cation exchange resin, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), may provide a safer alternative to SPS while also aiding in the clearance of lithium. We present a patient case where a patient with symptomatic acute-on-chronic lithium toxicity had increased clearance of lithium after a dose of SZC.

4.2 Safety ofto avoid hypokalemia

The development of hypokalemia following the SZC initiation remains an apparent risk that requires close monitoring. Established serum targets for potassium levels are > 4.0 mEq/L in patients with heart failure to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This is a rationale why we defined serum potassium < 4.0 mEq/L as "hypokalemia" in this study.

Relatively lower baseline serum potassium level (between 5.0 and 5.5 mEq/L) was associated with post‐SZC hypokalemia. Higher age, impaired renal function, and the use of diuretics were collectively associated with the development of hypokalemia. Elderly heart failure patients often have chronic kidney disease, which require diuretics therapy for the management of systemic congestion. The use of diuretics worsens renal function via vascular hypovolemia, impaired pre‐renal blood flow, and activation of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system. Diuretics is in general increases the secretion of potassium in urine and reduces serum potassium. Therefore, it is not surprising that these characteristics are associated with extreme reduction in serum potassium level during the SZC therapy. Caution should be exercised when initiating loading doses of SZC particularly for these specific cohort. Of note, the cohort with these characteristics is just the dominant target of SZC therapy.

4.3 Limitations and future directions

This study is a proof of concept and consisted of a small sample size. We believe these findings are relevant nevertheless in regards to the risk of loading therapy in patients with heart failure and mild hyperkalemia (serum potassium between 5.0 and 5.5 mEq/L). For those with risks of post‐SZC hypokalemia, we recommend initiating SZC at a maintenance dose, instead of a loading dose, particularly when hyperkalemia is mild.

We acknowledge the presence of confounding variables in this study which may be better mitigated in a larger prospective analysis. Our findings should be validated in a larger‐scale cohort including comprehensive clinical data. We observed only 2‐day SZC therapy, and a long‐term study should be conducted. Our patients received potassium‐restricting diet and none of them had anorexia. Our findings might not simply be adopted in such cohort.

### Effects of dialysate potassium concentration of 3.0 mmol / L with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on dialysis-free days versus dialysate potassium concentration of 2.0 mmol / L alone on rates of cardiac arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients with hyperkalemia [^f9093fe8]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal approach towards managing serum potassium (sK +) and hemodialysate potassium concentrations is uncertain. To study this, adults receiving hemodialysis for three months or more with hyperkalemia (pre-dialysis sK + 5.1–6.5 mmol/l) had cardiac monitors implanted and were randomized to either eight weeks of 2.0 mmol/l potassium/1.25 mmol/l calcium dialysate without sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) (2.0 potassium/noSZC) or 3.0 mmol/l potassium/1.25 mmol/l calcium dialysate combined with SZC (3.0 potassium/SZC) on non-dialysis days to maintain pre-dialysis sK + 4.0–5.5 mmol/l, followed by treatment crossover for another eight weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of adjudicated atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes of at least 2 minutes duration. Secondary outcomes included clinically significant arrhythmias (bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and/or asystole) and the proportion of sK + measurements within an optimal window of 4.0–5.5 mmol/l. Among 88 participants (mean age: 57.1 years; 51% male; mean pre-dialysis sK +: 5.5 mmol/l) with 25.5 person-years of follow-up, 296 AF episodes were detected in nine patients. The unadjusted AF rate was lower with 3.0 potassium/SZC versus 2.0 potassium/noSZC; 9.7 vs. 13.4/person-year (modeled rate ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.41–0.65). Clinically significant arrhythmias were reduced with 3.0 potassium/SZC vs. 2.0 potassium/noSZC (6.8 vs. 10.2/person-year modeled rate ratio 0.47; 0.38; 0.58). Fewer sK + measurements outside the optimal window occurred with 3.0 potassium/SZC (modeled odds ratio: 0.27; 0.12–0.35). Hypokalemia was less frequent (33 vs. 58 patients) with 3.0 potassium/SZC compared with 2.0 potassium/noSZC. Thus, in patients with hyperkalemia on maintenance hemodialysis, a combination of hemodialysate potassium 3.0 mmol/l and SZC on non-hemodialysis days reduced the rates of AF, other clinically significant arrhythmias, and post-dialysis hypokalemia compared with hemodialysate potassium 2.0/noSZC.

Glomerular disease — monitoring, sick-day guidance, and management of hyperkalemia and acidosis with RAS blockade: Monitor labs frequently if on ACEi or ARB. Titration of ACEi or ARB may cause acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia. Counsel patients to hold ACEi or ARB and diuretics when at risk for volume depletion, with increased risk for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia; consider transiently stopping RASi during sick days and counsel patients according to level of education in a culturally sensitive manner. Use potassium-wasting diuretics and/or potassium-binding agents to reduce serum potassium to normal, in order to use RAS blocking medications for BP control and proteinuria reduction, including loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate; each 10 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate contains 800 mg of sodium. Treat metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l) and supplement with oral sodium bicarbonate.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^9c819932]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life-threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complication and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium sparing agents, such the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well-established cornerstone and life-saving therapy. In this review we discuss recent findings and current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life-saving potassium sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia-associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium-binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium-binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated. Novel potassium-binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline-recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications: Contrariwise, "moderate" potassium levels go with a better prognosis, while the emergence of new drugs, potassium binders, could allow target doses of RAASi to be achieved.

Other drug treatment recommendations — In patients with heart failure (HF) class II to IV symptoms, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation may be reasonable to use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In patients with HF who experience hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/L) while taking a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi), the effectiveness of potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to improve outcomes by facilitating continuation of RAASi therapy is uncertain. In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) without a specific indication (eg, venous thromboembolism [VTE], AF, a previous thromboembolic event, or a cardioembolic source), anticoagulation is not recommended.

### Intermittent sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the prevention of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease [^5dc97936]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that in CKD patients, intermittent SZC treatment reduces the average plasma potassium level, the number of hyperkalemic episodes, and the need of urgent treatment of hyperkalemia. The treatment is well tolerated, although there was no effect on patient hospitalization or the progression of kidney failure.

SZC is well reported to be an effective acute treatment for hyperkalemia, with a fast onset of action. In an open-label study, serum potassium levels decreased from 5.6 to 4.5 mmol/l after treatment for 48 h, with the median time to normalization being 2.2 h. Daily SZC treatment for 14 to 28 days was safe and effective in maintaining normokalemia. More recently, Spinowitz et al. reported that once daily SZC treatment for up to 12 months could achieve a serum potassium level of below 5.1 mmol/l in 88% patient. The absolute magnitude of plasma potassium reduction appear to be less in our present study, which is probably the result of a lower dosage of SZC being used. Unlike the previous studies that recruited patients following an episode of hyperkalemia that require immediate treatment, our present study was retrospective and patients were put on intermittent SZC according to the physician's judgement. Ten patients (28%) of our present series did not have any episode of plasma potassium above 5.5 mmol/l before SZC therapy, indicating that a substantial proportion of the patients in our series were low risk, which may contribute to the limited magnitude of clinical benefit observed.

In this study, we did not find a reduction in hospitalization after intermittent SZC therapy, probably because most hyperkalemic episodes were treated in the Emergency Department or as out-patient, and hyperkalemia was rarely the reason of hospital admission. Notably, previous studies on the extended treatment of daily SZC did not report hospitalization as an outcome parameter. Because of the limitations in our source data, we did not have a detailed analysis on the use of RAAS inhibitor therapy in our patients. In a previous study, Spinowitz et al. showed that once daily SZC treatment resulted in the continuation of RAAS inhibitor therapy in 87% of CKD patients. It would therefore be interesting to explore whether low dose intermittent SZC therapy – which has the distinct advantages of saving cost and encouraging medication adherence – would facilitate the continuation of RAAS inhibitor therapy, which is highly important for the care of patients with advanced CKD.

### Cost effectiveness of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD in Norway and Sweden [^afd30959]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Novel oral K + binders that safely and effectively manage serum K + may be used to achieve guideline-directed doses of RAASi therapy, which has significant potential to improve long-term outcomes in CKD patients. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a novel oral K + binder that has been shown in the ZS-003 and HARMONIZE trials and two open-label studies, ZS-004E and ZS-005 to significantly reduce serum K + in patients with hyperkalaemia and to subsequently maintain normokalaemia. SZC has been recommended by Norwegian Medicines Agency for patients with CKD who develop hyperkalaemia due to RAASi treatment and for patients with heart failure (HF) with serum K + ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, and by Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency for use in Sweden for adults with CKD stage 3–5, with or without chronic heart failure (HF), when resonium is not suitable; and for adults with chronic HF without comorbid CKD. The value of SZC at the population level, in terms of the long-term health and economic burden of hyperkalaemia and suboptimal RAASi therapy in CKD patients, has been limited due to modest treatment uptake, particularly in Sweden. Therefore, this study evaluated the cost effectiveness of SZC versus usual care – a combination of RAASi dose adjustments and intermittent SPS/CPS therapy – for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD in Norway and Sweden.

In contrast, Hasara et al. who assessed the SPS versus SZC in managing hyperkalemia in the ED reported a − 1.1 mEq/L reduction in serum K in both groups in the first measurement following administration of drugs indicating no superiority for one on other. Also, Sullivan et al. in their study revealed a mean drop in serum potassium of 0.96 mEq/L with SPS and 0.78 mEq/L with SZC within 24 h following binder administration (P < 0.0001). Although the SPS resulted in a statistically higher drop in serum potassium, there was a considerable variability in the doses applied limiting the comparison ability of specific doses. Furthermore, Lewis et al. found that the SZC 10 g, SZC (3 doses of 10 g), and SPS 15–30 g resulted in a potassium reduction of 0.70 mmol/L, 0.78 mmol/L, and 0.99 mmol/L within 12–30 h, respectively (p < 0.01). This difference may also be attributed to variability of doses used in each group.

In the present study, no significant differences between groups in interdialytic weight gain, blood pressure, serum sodium, calcium, phosphorus, or albumin levels. Rescue therapy was required less frequently in the SZC group (4%) than in the SPS group (8%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.678). Similarly, according to Fu et al. serum levels of sodium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus did not significantly change within 72 h following medication consumption without any reported severe adverse events. SZC selectively binds potassium ions across a larger surface area in the GI in exchange for hydrogen and sodium ions. This mechanism minimizes potassium reabsorption without significant sodium overload or disruption of other electrolyte balances. Its high selectivity reduces the likelihood of interfering with calcium, phosphorus, or albumin levels. While SPS works mainly in the colon by exchanging potassium for sodium ions, but its action is less selective. Despite this, the exchange process generally does not significantly affect other systemic electrolyte levels.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ce831623]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Clinical impact of suboptimal RAASi therapy following an episode of hyperkalemia [^6c560856]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite strong evidence for the cardiorenal protective effects of RAASis, findings from observational studies of routine clinical practice show that prescribing RAASi doses below the maximum target dose is common in patients with HF and CKD. A large European study found that while 67–92% of hospitalized patients with HF were treated with the recommended RAASi agents, two-thirds had not achieved the recommended target dose of those agents. Other studies have demonstrated that therapy with RAASis below the maximum dose increases the risk of major adverse cardiac events and mortality in both CKD and HF populations.

Current guidelines posit that HK should not be a barrier to RAASi optimization, but studies show that once RAASi is discontinued or down-titrated following an episode of HK, it is often not restarted or up-titrated. The international Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for CKD, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for HK, the HF guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) all emphasize the importance of managing HK to facilitate RAASi therapy, and recommend using anti-HK treatment with potassium binders. For example, the ESC 2021 HF guidelines stipulate that in patients with HK who are not on maximally tolerated, guideline-recommended target dose of RAASi, an anti-HK agent may be initiated, RAASi therapy should be up-titrated with close monitoring of potassium levels, and upon achieving normokalemia, the anti-HK treatment should be maintained. Considering the suboptimal tolerability profile of conventional binders, which hampers their long-term use, the guidelines recommend newer anti-HK agents (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [SZC]).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^744c0ae4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC)

FDA-approved in 2018, SZC binds K + in exchange for sodium and hydrogen ions within the small intestine. SZC mimics physiological K + ion channels and has over 25-fold selectivity for K + over other ions such as Ca 2+ and Mg 2+, in comparison to SPS which shows a 0.2–0.3 selectivity for K + over these ions. The safety and efficacy of SZC for the management of chronic hyperkalemia has been well documented in numerous randomized controlled trials in the ambulatory setting. Its potential utility in acute hyperkalemia therapy was examined in a multicenter, phase three, double-blind study which randomized 753 patients to receive SZC (either 1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, or 10 g) or placebo three times daily for 48 h. SZC was demonstrated to lower serum K + at 48 h from 5.3 mEq/L to 4.6 mEq/L (P < 0.001) while a clinically significant treatment effect was observed at 1 h utilizing the 10 g dose. Kosiborod et al. demonstrated similar clinical significance at 1 h.

The ENERGIZE study is the only study to date analyzing SZC in the ER setting. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial (n = 70), SZC in addition to insulin and glucose incurred a greater reduction in serum K + at 2 h compared to insulin and glucose alone (−0.72 ± 0.12 vs. -0.36 ± 0.11 mEq/L).

Comparison of the mechanism of action, degree of K + lowering, and potential side effects of the oral potassium binders is summarized in Table 2. As discussed above, data is limited regarding the potential role of the newer potassium binders (patiromer and SZC) for the therapy of acute hyperkalemia. We are addressing this knowledge gap with a head-to-head comparison of the oral potassium binders in the KBindER study.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^839a273b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

### Revisiting RAAS blockade in CKD with newer potassium-binding drugs [^190d6a13]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Among patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), current guideline recommendations mandate the use of agents blocking the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) as first-line antihypertensive therapy based on randomized trials demonstrating that RAAS inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drug classes in slowing nephropathy progression to end-stage renal disease. However, the opportunities for adequate RAAS blockade in CKD are often limited, and an important impediment is the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when RAAS inhibitors are used in maximal doses or are combined. Accordingly, a large proportion of patients with proteinuric CKD may not have the anticipated renoprotective benefits since RAAS blockers are often discontinued due to incident hyperkalemia or are administered at suboptimal doses for fear of the development of hyperkalemia. Two newer potassium binders, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), have been shown to effectively and safely reduce serum potassium levels and maintain long-term normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. Whether these novel potassium-lowering therapies can overcome the barrier of hyperkalemia and enhance the tolerability of RAAS inhibitor use in proteinuric CKD awaits randomized trials.

### Utilization of potassium binders for the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease: a position statement by US nephrologists [^683b6245]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Two potassium (K +) binders-patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-are recommended by international guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. There is, however, no universally accepted best practice for how to appropriately utilize K + binders in the long-term clinical management of CKD. A panel of eight US-based nephrologists convened in October 2022 to develop a consensus statement regarding utilizing K + binders in clinical practice to help manage patients with nonemergent, persistent/recurrent hyperkalemia in CKD. Consensus was reached on the following topics: (1) identifying risk factors for hyperkalemia; (2) serum K + monitoring before and during K + binder use; (3) utilizing K + binders in patients receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and dialysis; and (4) when to initiate K + binders and their duration of use. These consensus statements for the use of K + binders may assist the nephrology community in optimizing management of hyperkalemia in patients across the spectrum of CKD.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus sodium polystyrene sulfonate for treatment of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients: a randomized clinical trial [^242f513c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, around three million patients worldwide are end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dependent on renal replacement therapy, mainly maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with forecasts estimating between five and ten million by 2030. Patients with ESRD, especially the ones undergoing HD are at high risk of developing hyperkalemia, which is usually defined as serum potassium (K+) concentrations > 5.0 mmol/l, even with thrice-weekly HD sessions. Hyperkalemia can result in sudden cardiac death if not urgently controlled.

The main approaches for managing the hyperkalemia in ESRD patients include dietary K + restriction, additional dialysis sessions, reducing the dialysate K + concentration, and the avoidance of drugs that increase serum K + levels. The gastrointestinal (GI) system eliminates approximately 10% of daily K + intake. Potassium transport along the colon is different, with the proximal colon revealing net secretion and the distal colon revealing net absorption. In addition, recent data show an increase in colonic K + secretion in dialysis patients. Therefore, to avoid pre-dialysis hyperkalemia, a long-term therapy using drugs promoting intestinal K + elimination is applied, for which the GI tract offers a potentially major novel avenue for K + excretion.

Until recently, the only K+-binding agents used to reverse hyperkalemia were sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS). SPS works in the colon as a cation-exchange resin, binding K + ions nonspecifically in exchange for sodium in a K + concentration-dependent manner. In small doses, SPS can be used to treat hyperkalemia in patients receiving continuous HD. It has not proved effective in large prospective trials, and there is inadequate long-term evidence of beneficial effects. Additionally, this K+-binding drug has been associated with GI discomfort and disorders. The sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) and patiromer are additional K+-binders that were recently authorized for the management of hyperkalemia. Unlike SPS and patiromer that work mainly in the colon, published data suggest that SZC acts across a larger surface area in the GI tract including the intestine (duodenum and jejunum). Furthermore, SZC shows very selective pH-independent binding of K+. SZC is capable of keeping predialysis K + values within 4.0 to 5.0 mmol/l range. So far, there is insufficient comparative data on different K + binders in HD patients.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^b78a7278]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Management of hyperkalemia in chronic heart failure using sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [^580915fa]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patient selection

Consecutive patients with heart failure and hyperkalemia, who received SZC at least for 2 days during the index hospitalization between July 2020 and November 2020, were included in this retrospective study. Definition of heart failure was based on the Framingham criteria. Patients dependent on hemodiafiltration and those receiving sodium polystyrene sulphonate did not receive SZC and were excluded from this study. No patients had mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists given the existence of hyperkalemia.

Serum potassium levels were measured at baseline (day 0) and 2 days later (day 2). Informed consent was obtained from all participants and this study was approved by the institutional ethical board beforehand.

2.2 therapy

In patients with hyperkalemia, SZC was initiated at a loading dose (30 g per day) or as a maintenance dose (5 g per day) for 2 days at the attending physicians' discretion. All other medical therapies were continued without adjustment.

2.3 Data collection

Baseline demographic, laboratory, and medication data obtained within 24 h prior to the SZC administration were collected. Of note, baseline (day 0) and day 2 serum potassium levels were obtained. The change in serum potassium level during the two‐day SZC therapy was calculated as a primary endpoint.

2.4 Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistics 22 (SPSS Inc, Armonk, IL). Two‐sided p‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All variables were assumed as non‐parametric data given a small sample size. Changes in serum potassium levels during the two‐day SZC therapy were compared between the loading dose group and maintenance dose group using a Mann–Whitney U test as a primary outcome (efficacy analysis). Baseline characteristics were compared between those who suffered hypokalemia (defined as serum potassium level < 4.0 mEq/L) on day 2 and those without hypokalemia on day 2 (safety analysis).

### Potassium responses to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients: post-hoc analysis of DIALIZE [^89e468a0]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for hyperkalemia in maintenance hemodialysis patients. In post-hoc analyses of the phase 3b DIALIZE study, we examined the spectrum of potassium responses to SZC.

Methods

Post-hoc analyses with SZC and placebo included: the number of long interdialytic interval (LIDI) visits during the 4-week evaluation period where patients attained pre-dialysis serum potassium (sK +) concentrations of 4.0–5.0 and 4.0–5.5mmol/L; potassium gradient (the difference between pre-dialysis sK + and dialysate potassium) at days 36, 43, 50, and 57, and change from baseline to the end of treatment (EOT) using categories of potassium gradient (1 to < 2, 2 to < 3, 3 to < 4, and ≥ 4mmol/L).

Results

A greater proportion of patients achieved the ranges of pre-dialysis sK + concentration with SZC versus placebo for ≥ 1, ≥ 2, ≥ 3, and 4 LIDI visits over 4weeks; 23.7 and 48.5% of patients in the SZC group achieved pre-dialysis sK + concentrations of 4.0–5.0 and 4.0–5.5mmol/L, respectively, at all 4 LIDI visits. Baseline mean potassium gradient was similar with SZC and placebo. At day 57, mean (standard deviation) potassium gradient was 2.78 (0.08) mmol/L with SZC and 3.52 (0.08) mmol/L with placebo; mean difference (95% confidence interval) was -0.74mmol/L (-0.97 to -0.52). A greater reduction in potassium gradient category from baseline towards lower-risk categories at EOT was observed with SZC versus placebo.

Conclusions

These analyses expand our knowledge of the spectrum of potassium responses with SZC in hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients.

### Potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with chronic kidney disease [^eb27bb5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side-effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically-relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy-makers.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled studies (quasi-RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes.

Main Results

Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross-over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD -0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.97, -0.27; I² = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD -3.73 mmHg, 95%CI -6.64 to -0.83; I² = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.79; I² = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. There was no difference between high-dose and low-dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence supporting clinical decision-making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy-makers. This data could be used to assess cost-effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d3aab6c7]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in heart failure (HF) — patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC): Hyperkalemia is common in HF as a result of the syndrome itself, comorbidities (diabetes, CKD), and use of RAASi, and can increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Both agents have been FDA approved for treatment of hyperkalemia for patients receiving RAASi. In the PEARL-HF trial, patiromer led to lower potassium levels, less hyperkalemia, and a higher proportion of patients able to increase spironolactone dose to 50 mg daily compared with placebo. The HARMONIZE trial included 94 patients (out of 258 total) with HF (87 of whom entered the double-blind phase). The SZC groups achieved lower potassium levels overall compared with placebo, and a higher proportion maintained normokalemia (potassium levels, < 5.1 mEq/L). Whether patiromer or SZC improve clinical outcomes is under investigation. Adverse effects for the newer potassium binders include hypomagnesemia (for patiromer) and edema (for SZC).

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus sodium polystyrene sulfonate for treatment of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients: a randomized clinical trial [^b84b226c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the current study, serious adverse events occurred in 4% of SZC patients and 6% of SPS patients, with no statistical significance (p = 1.000). GI side effects (e.g. diarrhea, constipation, nausea) were less frequent in the SZC group (5%) compared to the SPS group (11.6%), leading to drug discontinuation in one SPS patient. Also, SZC demonstrated better tolerability, with fewer adverse events overall. Similarly, Joyce and Corpman included 246 patients; and found a similar efficacy and safety outcomes between SZC and SPS. Only the SPS group experienced the five major adverse events that were documented. In a RCT by Fishbane et al. SZC was effective and well tolerated in hyperkalemic ESKD patients undergoing maintenance HD. Regarding palatability, we found that SZC was significantly more palatable than SPS in our patients (p < 0.001). Similar findings were reported by Wheeler et al.

Our study's strength points include being the first prospective trial to compare SZC and SPS directly in HD patients in the same study. In addition, we assessed this comparison taking into consideration efficacy and safety outcomes, including serum K, BP, IDWG, laboratory parameters, and adverse events. Possible limitations of our study might be the relatively small sample size (n = 120), short follow-up duration (8 weeks), and longer periods would have significantly strengthened our findings. Also, we did not use different doses for both drugs which could have provided more data about the efficacy and flexibility of administration. In addition, we did not calculate the amount of K in diet (mEq/day) due to difficulty of precise estimation. Also, despite the non-significant difference between both groups regarding the presence of residual UOP, but we did not measure the amount of UOP in those patients. Additionally as illustrated above, we excluded from the study any patient with constipation, diarrhea or on chronic laxatives, but we did not take into consideration the frequency of bowel movements in the included patients which can affect K removal. Finally, our study design did not include a cross over phase which could have significantly support our findings.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the acute management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department [^3063ecd6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited evidence exists examining the use of potassium binders for the acute management of hyperkalemia.

Objective

The objective of the study is to evaluate the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) for the acute management of hyperkalemia.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department with an initial potassium ≥ 5.6 mEq/L and treated with the institutional hyperkalemia order set.

Results

Overall, 189 patients were included. There was no significant difference in serum potassium change from baseline to first potassium within 6 hours between the SZC and non-SZC groups (-1.096 ± 0.71 vs -1.067 mEq/L ± 0.81, P = 0.798), respectively. No significant difference was seen between the SZC and non-SZC groups for time from initial hyperkalemia to order set medication administration (1.9 ± 1 vs 2.5 ± 2.9 hours, P = 0.63), mean hospital length of stay (5.5 ± 4.5 vs 6.6 days ± 6.9, P = 0.197), or potassium level at first recheck (5.17 ± 0.68 vs 5.34 mEq/L ± 0.76, P = 0.108). Time from the first medication administration to potassium recheck differed by about 1 hour between groups (4.1 ± 3.1 vs 5.1 hours ± 3.2, P = 0.035), and patients in the SZC group were less likely to have a potassium > 6 mEq/L at the first recheck (10.1% vs 21%, P = 0.047).

Conclusion and Relevance

The optimal use of SZC in the acute management remains uncertain based on results from this study with no difference in potassium levels at first recheck.

### Steroidal or non-steroidal MRAs: should we still enable RAASi use through K binders? [^d41c55d0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are important interventions to improve outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and heart failure, but their use is limited in some patients by the development of hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may differ between agents, with one trial showing lower risk of hyperkalemia with the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone compared with steroidal MRA spironolactone. Novel potassium binders, including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, are available interventions to manage hyperkalemia and enable continuation of RAASi and MRAs in patients who could benefit from these treatments. These agents bind free potassium ions in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to prevent the absorption of dietary potassium and increase potassium secretion. Several studies showed that potassium binders are effective compared with placebo for preventing hyperkalemia or steroidal MRA discontinuation, but none has evaluated whether this strategy impacts clinically important endpoints such as cardiovascular events. Due to this and other limitations related to cost, clinical availability, pill burden and patient selection, alternative potential strategies to mitigate hyperkalemia may be more practical. Conservative strategies include increased monitoring and use of loop or thiazide diuretics to increase urinary potassium excretion. Non-steroidal MRAs may have a lower risk of hyperkalemia than steroidal MRAs and have stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects with resultant reduced risk of kidney disease progression. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors also decrease hyperkalemia risk in patients on MRAs and decrease cardiovascular events and kidney disease progression. These may be better first-line interventions to obviate the need for potassium binders and offer additional benefits.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ebdf88ad]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^c2430715]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the setting of normal kidney function, serum potassium (K +) is maintained within a tight range (3.5–5.3 mEq/L) via renal excretion and cellular redistribution. Hyperkalemia is considered severe if K + is ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, with or without symptomatic muscle weakness/paralysis or electrocardiogram changes. Severe hyperkalemia occurs in up to 10% of all hospitalized patients and is an independent predictor of increased mortality that is associated with prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and a 30-day hospital readmission rate of 14.21% vs. 9.86% in non-hyperkalemic patients.

Risk factors for hyperkalemia include chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and use of certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Historically, discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors occurred in ~75% of cases in response to drug-induced hyperkalemia, potentially leaving patients vulnerable to adverse cardiovascular events. The emergence of the newer oral potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [SZC]) has allowed maintenance of normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. However, there is a lack of data on the potential utility of these binders for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.
