## Question

What are the common adverse effects of Levophed infusion in critically ill patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common adverse effects of Levophed (norepinephrine) infusion in critically ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources to anchor the adverse effect profile. Then, I should verify which adverse effects are explicitly labeled as most common. Next, I will categorize risks by organ system and highlight dose- and context-dependent complications. After that, I should review safety data for peripheral administration and extravasation. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list and note monitoring and mitigation strategies, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the labels and high-quality reviews before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources I will rely on. The FDA prescribing information for Levophed provides the most definitive adverse reaction listing and warnings, and I should cross-check this with contemporary critical care reviews and guidelines to ensure clinical relevance and completeness.

> I need to verify which adverse effects are explicitly labeled as most common. The FDA labeling states that the most common adverse reactions are hypertension and bradycardia, and it also lists ischemic injury, anxiety, transient headache, respiratory difficulty, and extravasation necrosis at the injection site as common, which I should keep front and center in the synthesis [^117GgAfm] [^1175gu8q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking. Norepinephrine's alpha-1 vasoconstriction can cause excessive afterload and reflex bradycardia, and its beta-1 effects can precipitate arrhythmias, particularly in hypoxic or hypercarbic states, which aligns with the labeled warnings and physiologic plausibility [^1175CrM9] [^1153gqsh].

> Next, I should review tissue ischemia and extravasation risks, since these are clinically pivotal in the ICU. The FDA warns that extravasation can cause necrosis and sloughing, and it recommends infusion into a large vein with frequent site checks and prompt phentolamine infiltration if extravasation occurs. Importantly, contemporary data suggest that with careful peripheral administration, extravasation occurs in about 3.4% and serious tissue injury is rare, though risk rises with distal catheters and longer durations, so I should qualify the risk by practice patterns and vigilance [^1175CrM9] [^113iQevL] [^111zuGEc].

> I will now examine cardiovascular adverse effects beyond hypertension and bradycardia. Arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, are a recognized risk, especially with hypoxia or hypercarbia, and abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound hypotension, so gradual tapering with volume expansion is advised. I should confirm that these are consistently emphasized across labels and reviews, which they are [^1175CrM9] [^1153gqsh] [^114dCsaS].

> Let me consider metabolic and endocrine effects. Norepinephrine can reduce insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose, so glucose monitoring and antidiabetic adjustments are prudent. I should double-check that this is supported beyond anecdote, and indeed, clamp studies in humans demonstrate insulin resistance with pressor-dose norepinephrine, which is clinically meaningful in ICU glycemic management [^1153gqsh] [^116FCtLB].

> But wait, what about dose-related toxicity and organ dysfunction signals. Observational dose–response meta-analyses associate higher norepinephrine doses with increased mortality, though confounding by severity is likely. Still, this reinforces the principle to use the lowest effective dose, reassess volume status, and escalate adjuncts rather than relentlessly increasing catecholamine exposure, which is echoed by critical care reviews advocating catecholamine-sparing strategies in refractory shock [^114dEqmq] [^115b6xZD] [^114vNymz].

> I should confirm the peripheral administration safety profile and correct any overstatements. Earlier I thought "extravasation occurs in 3.4% with 0% necrosis", but wait, let me verify the exact figures. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign reports extravasation in 3.4% with no reported tissue necrosis or limb ischemia in pooled analyses, and a large perioperative cohort showed 2.3% extravasation with no necrosis requiring intervention, supporting that with proximal, large-bore catheters and short duration, serious local injury is uncommon, though not impossible [^113iQevL] [^111zuGEc] [^113xcRL2].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, alpha-mediated uteroplacental vasoconstriction can compromise fetal perfusion, so maternal stabilization remains priority but fetal monitoring is essential. In hepatic disease, particularly HRS-AKI, norepinephrine is effective but clinicians must balance ischemic risks and consider alternatives like terlipressin in selected scenarios, which is reflected in hepatology guidance [^115kHrgo] [^112WbvwV].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized, clinically useful list. Most common adverse effects include hypertension and bradycardia, ischemic tissue injury including extravasation with necrosis risk, anxiety and headache, respiratory difficulty and pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrhythmias. Dose- and context-dependent risks include metabolic effects such as hyperglycemia and lactic acidosis, renal and mesenteric hypoperfusion when used in uncorrected hypovolemia, and rebound hypotension with abrupt cessation, all of which warrant proactive monitoring and mitigation [^117GgAfm] [^1175CrM9] [^1153gqsh].

> I should double-check practical mitigation steps so the synthesis is actionable. Use central venous access when feasible, prefer proximal large-bore peripheral catheters if central access is delayed, inspect the site frequently, and treat extravasation promptly with phentolamine. Titrate to the lowest effective dose, correct hypovolemia before initiation, wean gradually, and monitor blood pressure continuously with continuous cardiac monitoring in patients at risk for arrhythmias [^1175CrM9] [^113iQevL] [^115mYiXj].

Levophed (norepinephrine) infusion in critically ill patients commonly causes **hypertension and bradycardia** [^117GgAfm] due to potent alpha-1 vasoconstriction and baroreflex-mediated slowing of heart rate. Other frequent effects include **anxiety, headache, and respiratory difficulty** [^117GgAfm] [^117AmMpb]. The most serious risks are **tissue ischemia and extravasation necrosis** [^1175CrM9], especially with distal peripheral catheters or prolonged infusion, and can lead to gangrene if unrecognized [^1175CrM9]. Arrhythmias may occur, particularly with hypoxia or hypercarbia [^1175CrM9], and abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound hypotension [^1175CrM9]. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continuously, use central access when feasible, and treat extravasation promptly with phentolamine to reduce ischemic injury [^1175CrM9] [^113iQevL].

---

## Cardiovascular adverse effects

- **Hypertension**: Common from alpha-1 vasoconstriction; monitor closely and titrate to target MAP [^117GgAfm] [^111PC3YS].

- **Bradycardia**: Reflex vagal response to increased afterload; monitor heart rate continuously [^117GgAfm] [^1175CrM9].

- **Arrhythmias**: Ventricular arrhythmias can occur, especially with hypoxia or hypercarbia; use continuous cardiac monitoring [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

- **Hypotension after abrupt discontinuation**: Rebound hypotension is common; taper gradually while expanding volume [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

---

## Neurological adverse effects

Anxiety and **headache** are common and usually transient; monitor and provide supportive care [^117GgAfm] [^117AmMpb].

---

## Respiratory adverse effects

Respiratory difficulty and **pulmonary edema** can occur, particularly in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease; monitor oxygenation and respiratory status [^117GgAfm] [^117AmMpb].

---

## Local tissue adverse effects

- **Extravasation necrosis**: Severe tissue ischemia and necrosis can occur, especially with distal catheters or prolonged infusion; use central access when possible and monitor the site frequently [^1175CrM9] [^113iQevL].

- **Gangrene**: Rare but serious, particularly in patients with occlusive vascular disease or prolonged high-dose infusion; monitor extremities closely [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine adverse effects

Hyperglycemia may occur due to **reduced insulin sensitivity**; monitor glucose and adjust insulin as needed [^1153gqsh] [^116FCtLB].

---

## Factors influencing adverse effects

Several factors influence the **risk and severity** of adverse effects:

| **Factor** | **Influence on adverse effects** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged infusion increase risk of ischemia, arrhythmias, and metabolic effects [^1175CrM9] [^114dEqmq] |
| Patient comorbidities | Pre-existing cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes increase susceptibility to adverse effects [^1175CrM9] [^1153gqsh] |
| Route of administration | Peripheral administration increases risk of extravasation and tissue necrosis compared to central administration [^1175CrM9] [^113iQevL] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To minimize adverse effects, the following **monitoring and management strategies** are recommended:

- **Continuous hemodynamic monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac rhythm continuously during infusion [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

- **Regular assessment of infusion site**: Check for signs of extravasation, ischemia, or necrosis frequently [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

- **Gradual tapering of infusion**: Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent rebound hypotension [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

- **Prompt treatment of extravasation**: Infiltrate phentolamine (5–10 mg in 10–15 mL saline) within 12 hours to prevent tissue necrosis [^1175CrM9] [^115mYiXj].

---

Levophed infusion in critically ill patients commonly causes **hypertension, bradycardia, anxiety, headache, respiratory difficulty, and extravasation necrosis**. Serious risks include tissue ischemia, gangrene, and arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring, careful titration, and prompt management of complications are essential to minimize harm [^117GgAfm] [^1175CrM9].

### Association of noradrenaline dose with mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114QDbRP]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings align with prior research about the association of noradrenaline with patient outcomes in critical care settings. However, our study has limitations. Primarily, our inclusion criteria encompassed all studies that reported mortality corresponding to varying dosages of noradrenaline. This approach inevitably led to diverse patient populations, including patients with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and potentially even patients without shock who were receiving vasopressors to mitigate hypotension induced by other factors such as sedative drugs or renal replacement therapy. It also led to various definitions of noradrenaline dose, some using the maximal dose received, some the average, with various time frames. Therefore, a rigorous selection of studies was performed to include homogenous studies in the meta-analysis, leading to a smaller than anticipated sample of included studies.

Furthermore, inconsistencies in noradrenaline formulations may contribute to bias in meta-analyses. Noradrenaline products are marketed as injectable aqueous solutions with variable concentrations. To ensure stability, solubility, and safe intravenous administration, noradrenaline is dispensed as a salt formulation. Different noradrenaline salts, including bitartrate monohydrate, tartrate (i.e. anhydrous bitartrate), and hydrochloride, are in use. This variability in formulation and dose reporting may introduce bias when pooling data from studies that did not specify the formulation used. To mitigate this risk, we reviewed the origins of the included centres and standardised accordingly: most studies originated from U.S. centres, with one European study that explicitly stated converting data to noradrenaline base. Using standardised reporting practices is essential to achieve accuracy and comparability of future dose-response analyses. Noradrenaline dose should be expressed as the amount of noradrenaline base. Lastly, our post hoc analyses revealed a higher-than-expected proportion of patients receiving very high doses of noradrenaline compared to previously published reports. Several factors may account for this discrepancy. The peak dose that we used in our analyses may reflect transient episodes of escalated vasopressor requirements. Additionally, the predominance of studies including septic shock patients, who often require the highest doses, may have influenced this observation. The use of norepinephrine-equivalent doses in some studies may also have inflated total dose estimates. Finally, in several studies the formulation was not explicitly stated, and noradrenaline base was presumed, potentially leading to an overestimation of the actual dose administered.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^1113yHrZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current dosing strategies

Due to its short half-life (< 2.5 min), norepinephrine must be administered as a continuous infusion. Manufacturers recommend diluting norepinephrine in dextrose containing solutions, due to potential inactivation by oxidation on saline solutions. Usual adult preparations concentration ranges from 16 mcg/mL to 128 mcg/mL. Recent data have highlighted the relative safety of short term (< 48 h), low dose (< 15 mcg/min) administration of norepinephrine diluted at 64 mcg/mL through peripheral intravenous access, notwithstanding, administration through central venous access is still hegemonic and advisable in current ICU practice. There is significant worldwide variability on drug formulations, as norepinephrine can be found either as tartrate, bitartrate or hydrochloride salts, with different molecular weights and potency equivalence to norepinephrine base, being tartrate the weakest formulation. Similarly, there is heterogeneity of practice on how to titrate the drug infusion, either using absolute (i.e. mcg/min) or weighted values (i.e. mcg/kg/min). Since its dose is tailored in the optics of a pharmacodynamic effect — blood pressure — it is titrated to meet clinical targets, regardless of formulation or dosing scheme. However, this heterogeneity could impact the interpretation and exchangeability of clinical data, design and execution of research, and compliance with expert's recommendations. Thus, homogenization and consensus should be sought.

Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to attain an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg. In daily practice though, clinicians frequently aim for higher MAP values, especially in the context of previous hypertension, despite recent data drawn from randomized studies suggesting that targeting higher MAP levels did not impact on mortality. Since the goal of hemodynamic resuscitation is to restore tissue perfusion, several physiological studies have assessed the impact of increasing MAP levels on microcirculatory variables, with a substantial heterogeneity on the response. Thus, MAP targets individualization could be desirable, and testing different levels in a dynamic fashion (i.e. through a vasopressor test) while assessing tissue perfusion trends could further aid to personalize therapy. On the other hand, in a recent randomized-controlled multicenter trial, titrating vasopressors and fluids based on sublingual microcirculation had no impact on microcirculatory flow nor mortality. Further research is needed, especially considering the heterogeneous response to norepinephrine on regional circulation (i.e. renal or splanchnic) and organ-specific perfusion pressure targets.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^115fWV9r]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

There are still many areas of uncertainties and room for improvement regarding norepinephrine use. First, consensus of clinical definitions is needed, such as refractory shock or high-dose vasopressors. With the emergence of novel vasoactive drugs, endeavors proposing equivalences between medications (catecholaminergic and non-catecholaminergic) could facilitate comparison between agents and clinical settings. Future studies should address the optimal timing of norepinephrine initiation, dosing strategies in special populations such as obese patients, and vasoactive drug weaning or de-escalation. Finally, the integration of closed loop-vasopressors infusion systems might enhance clinical practice in the near future.

In conclusion, norepinephrine is a pillar of ICU's pharmacological arsenal. Over the years, we have increased our understanding on the properties, clinical use, and adverse effect profile of this drug. Tackling the specific uncertainties in future research could translate into safer and better patient care.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1	Tissue Ischemia

Administration of norepinephrine bitartrate to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite "normal" blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating norepinephrine bitartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Avoid norepinephrine bitartrate in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction.

Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients.

Extravasation of norepinephrine bitartrate may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Emergency Treatment of Extravasation

To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults.

Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours.

5.2	Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation

Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the norepinephrine bitartrate infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids.

5.3	Cardiac Arrhythmias

Norepinephrine bitartrate elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias.

5.4	Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite

Norepinephrine bitartrate injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

### Levophed (r) norepinephrine bitartrate [^114cTqo1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

High Dosage: Great individual variation occurs in the dose required to attain and maintain an adequate blood pressure. In all cases, dosage of LEVOPHED should be titrated according to the response of the patient. Occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses (as high as 68 mg base or 17 vials) may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive, but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present. Central venous pressure monitoring is usually helpful in detecting and treating this situation.

Fluid Intake: The degree of dilution depends on clinical fluid volume requirements. If large volumes of fluid (dextrose) are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time, a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per mL should be used. On the other hand, when large volumes of fluid are clinically undesirable, a concentration greater than 4 mcg per mL may be necessary.

Duration of Therapy: The infusion should be continued until adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained without therapy. Infusions of LEVOPHED should be reduced gradually, avoiding abrupt withdrawal. In some of the reported cases of vascular collapse due to acute myocardial infarction, treatment was required for up to six days.

Adjunctive Treatment in Cardiac Arrest

Infusions of LEVOPHED are usually administered intravenously during cardiac resuscitation to restore and maintain an adequate blood pressure after an effective heartbeat and ventilation have been established by other means. [LEVOPHED's powerful beta-adrenergic stimulating action is also thought to increase the strength and effectiveness of systolic contractions once they occur.]

Average Dosage: To maintain systemic blood pressure during the management of cardiac arrest, LEVOPHED is used in the same manner as described under Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit.

Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.

Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.

Norepinephrine (NE) is mostly used to treat severe hypotension. However, NE has potentially adverse vasoconstrictive effects on regional vascular beds of kidney, liver, and gut, with a potential for ensuing organ dysfunction. NE therefore is considered as a last reserve in otherwise refractory hypotension. During sepsis, a loss of catecholamine responsiveness occurs that is often interpreted as down-regulation of catecholamine receptors. Therefore, the doses of NE needed to maintain or restore blood pressure may be extremely high. Surprisingly, no adverse vasoconstriction with subsequent hypoperfusion occurs during sepsis, despite the high doses of NE administered. Instead, NE rather causes an increase in blood flow and oxygen delivery.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tissue Ischemia: Avoid extravasation into tissues, which can cause local necrosis (5.1)
Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. Reduce the Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection infusion rate gradually. (5.2)
Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.3)

5.1 Tissue Ischemia

Administration of Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite "normal" blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Avoid Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction.

Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients.

Extravasation of Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Emergency Treatment of Extravasation

To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 mL to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults.

Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours.

5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation

Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Norepinephrine in Sodium Chloride Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias.

### Adverse events associated with administration of vasopressor medications through a peripheral intravenous catheter: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XwpLZ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of its strengths and limitations. It was conducted by rigorously following methodological guidelines for meta-analyses, and to our knowledge, is the first meta-analysis to examine the safety of PIV vasopressor administration in children, and the largest in adults. However, most included studies were single-centre, retrospective cohort studies, inherently at risk of reporting bias, and were generally at high/some risk of bias. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses suggest a reduction in heterogeneity among those studies at lower risk of bias, however the adverse event estimate remained similar. In addition, there was significant interstudy heterogeneity. Subgroup and stratified analyses examining factors known to contribute to clinical heterogeneity such as location of clinical care, PIV gauge, and vasopressor infusion duration were identified as factors contributing to the observed statistical heterogeneity. Owing to non-uniform reporting of data within the included studies we were unable to comment on contributions of vasopressor concentration and/or dose, two factors predicted to be important determinants of the safety of PIV vasopressor administration. Sensitivity analysis excluding a large study of operative patients by Pancaro et al. wherein data was primarily obtained from an electronic database (rather than manual chart review) and adverse event rates were reported to be lower, resulted in a marked reduction in heterogeneity among the residual studies in ICU, ED and step down unit patients. Based on its contribution to heterogeneity, combined with the fact that the study by Pancaro et al. was the only study to obtain adverse event data from a pre-existing electronic database wherein report of more minor adverse events such as extravasation, skin blanching, and mottling may be lower, argument could be made to exclude it from the main meta-analysis. However, we elected to keep it in the main meta-analysis and report its exclusion as a separate sensitivity analysis to be consistent with our original statistical analysis plan, as well as to reflect the true state of current literature. In addition, we employed a random effects model which more evenly distributes study weighting and prevents larger studies such as that of Pancaro et al. from having undue influence on pooled effect estimates. Asymmetry in vasopressor type among the included studies is another potential limitation. Norepinephrine was the most common and this likely reflects clinical practice in most jurisdictions, however, other frequently employed drugs such as epinephrine and vasopressin were underrepresented. Attempts to examine our results in subgroups defined by vasopressor type did not yield any significant differences in the incidence of adverse events, though the analysis was likely underpowered.

### A comparison of epinephrine and norepinephrine in critically ill patients [^113Crofg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there was a difference between epinephrine and norepinephrine in achieving a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal in intensive care (ICU) patients.

Design

Prospective, double-blind, randomised-controlled trial.

Setting

Four Australian university-affiliated multidisciplinary ICUs.

Patients and Participants

Patients who required vasopressors for any cause at randomisation. Patients with septic shock and acute circulatory failure were analysed separately.

Interventions

Blinded infusions of epinephrine or norepinephrine to achieve a MAP ≥ 70 mmHg for the duration of ICU admission.

Measurements

Primary outcome was achievement of MAP goal > 24 h without vasopressors. Secondary outcomes were 28 and 90-day mortality. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomised to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine. Median time to achieve the MAP goal was 35.1 h (interquartile range (IQR) 13.8–70.4 h) with epinephrine compared to 40.0 h (IQR 14.5–120 h) with norepinephrine (relative risk (RR) 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69–1.12; P = 0.26). There was no difference in the time to achieve MAP goals in the subgroups of patients with severe sepsis (n = 158; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.59–1.12; P = 0.18) or those with acute circulatory failure (n = 192; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62–1.27; P = 0.49) between epinephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine was associated with the development of significant but transient metabolic effects that prompted the withdrawal of 18/139 (12.9%) patients from the study by attending clinicians. There was no difference in 28 and 90-day mortality.

Conclusions

Despite the development of potential drug-related effects with epinephrine, there was no difference in the achievement of a MAP goal between epinephrine and norepinephrine in a heterogenous population of ICU patients.

### Selepressin, a novel selective vasopressin vagonist, is an effective substitute for norepinephrine in a phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled trial in septic shock patients [^111xvKHT]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Infusion of study drug and norepinephrine

The investigated starting and maximal infusion rates of selepressin were 1.25 ng/kg/minute, 2.5 ng/kg/minute, and 3.75 ng/kg/minute, with the patient's body weight being measured or estimated. Selepressin or placebo was infused via a central venous catheter at the constant initial rate in addition to open-label norepinephrine targeting a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mmHg. When patients were hemodynamically stable, open-label norepinephrine was tapered while maintaining target MAP with study drug. When the MAP was stable for 4 h without norepinephrine, study drug was weaned stepwise according to the protocol (Additional file 1: Table S2). If weaning resulted in hemodynamic instability, the study drug was reinstituted, and, if needed, open-label norepinephrine was restarted. Open-label norepinephrine was adjusted to maintain the MAP ≥ 65 mmHg if blinded study drug was insufficient. Patients received study drug until shock resolution (i.e. no vasopressor support) or a maximum of 7 days unless discontinued for safety reasons (Additional file 1: Table S3).

Open-label norepinephrine was supplied in the United States and Canada as norepinephrine bitartrate 1 mg/ml (Levophed, norepinephrine base; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) diluted in 5% dextrose and in Europe as Norepinephrine 1:1000 (norepinephrine tartrate; (Cardinal Health Ltd. Basingstoke, UK) 2 mg/ml (1 mg/ml norepinephrine base) diluted in 5% glucose. A tight protocol and accurate pumps (Braun Perfusor® Space; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) were used to calculate open-label norepinephrine delivered.

### Association of noradrenaline dose with mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114orxa1]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

At last, the inherent nature of a meta-analysis, and by extension a dose-response meta-analysis, is that its findings are only as robust as the studies it contains. In our case, all included studies were observational, carrying their inherent risk of bias. This was reflected in the substantial heterogeneity observed across studies, underscoring the need for prospective investigations with standardized definitions of vasopressor exposure and outcome reporting. Additionally, in the dose-response meta-analysis, we assumed that the modelled study-level association between noradrenaline dose and mortality reflects the patient-level dose-response, which is a strong assumption, but common in meta-analyses.

### Effect of continuous epinephrine infusion on survival in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1134L1mN]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epinephrine is frequently used as an inotropic and vasopressor agent in critically ill patients requiring hemodynamic support. Data from observational trials suggested that epinephrine use is associated with a worse outcome as compared with other adrenergic and nonadrenergic vasoactive drugs. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the effect of epinephrine administration on outcome of critically ill patients.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane central register were searched by two independent investigators up to March 2019.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria were: administration of epinephrine as IV continuous infusion, patients admitted to an ICU or undergoing major surgery, and randomized controlled trials. Studies on epinephrine administration as bolus (e.g., during cardiopulmonary resuscitation), were excluded. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up available.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators examined and extracted data from eligible trials.

Data Synthesis

A total of 5,249 studies were assessed, with a total of 12 studies (1,227 patients) finally included in the meta-analysis. The majority of the trials were performed in the setting of septic shock, and the most frequent comparator was a combination of norepinephrine plus dobutamine. We found no difference in all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available (197/579 [34.0%] in the epinephrine group vs 219/648 [33.8%] in the control group; risk ratio = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82–1.10; p = 0.49; I = 0%). No differences in the need for renal replacement therapy, occurrence rate of myocardial ischemia, occurrence rate of arrhythmias, and length of ICU stay were observed.

Conclusions

Current randomized evidence showed that continuous IV administration of epinephrine as inotropic/vasopressor agent is not associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients.

### Norepinephrine bitartrate (norepinephrine) [^115pQK9C]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. Clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower (see Data). Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m2basis for four days during organogenesis (see Data).

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus.

Data

Animal Data

A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine (40 mcg/min, at approximately 10 times the average maintenance dose of 2–4 mcg/min in human, on a mg/kg basis) exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed.

Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses.

In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions (29.1% in study group vs. 3.4% in control group), fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7–10).

### Adverse events of peripherally administered norepinephrine during surgery: a prospective multicenter study [^113xcRL2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative treatment of hypotension by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in a peripheral vein can lead to adverse events, for example, tissue necrosis. However, the incidence and severity of adverse events during perioperative administration are unknown.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study conducted at 3 Swedish hospitals from 2019 to 2022. A total of 1004 patients undergoing surgery, who met the criteria for perioperative peripheral norepinephrine administration, were included. The infusion site was inspected regularly. If swelling or paleness of skin was detected, the infusion site was changed to a different peripheral line. Systolic blood pressure and pulse frequency were monitored during the infusion time and defined as adverse events at > 220 mm Hg and < 40 beats•min -1. In case of adverse events, patients were observed for up to 48 hours. The primary outcome was prevalence of extravasation, defined as swelling around the infusion site. Secondary outcomes were all types of adverse events and associations between predefined clinical variables and risk of adverse events.

Results

We observed 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4%-3.2%) extravasation of infusion and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.7%) bradycardia. No cases of tissue necrosis or severe hypertension were detected. All adverse events had dissipated spontaneously within 48 hours. Proximal catheter placement was associated with more adverse events.

Conclusions

Extravasation of peripherally administrated norepinephrine in the perioperative period occurred at similar rates as in previous studies in critically ill patients. In our setting, where we regularly inspected the infusion site and shifted site in case of swelling or paleness of skin, we observed no case of severe adverse events. Given that severe adverse events were absent, the potential benefit of this preventive approach requires confirmation in a larger population.

### Timing of norepinephrine initiation in patients with septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ssggg]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Early norepinephrine use in septic shock can increase cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload and/or contractility and improve microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. However, the use of vasopressors is not without consequences. Risk of well-known adverse reactions, such as arrhythmias, may have been increased for patients with prolonged exposure to vasopressors, potentially adding to the increased mortality rate. Another main argument is that high doses of exogenous norepinephrine may have deleterious consequences such as myocardial cell injury, oxidative stress, and alteration of sepsis-associated immunomodulation. Splanchnic hypoperfusion is also an important concern when norepinephrine is given early. No matter what, norepinephrine remains the primary vasopressor in septic shock, and the existing evidence suggests that it remains a safe and effective first-line medication for septic shock.

At present, there is no uniform definition of "early" or "late" norepinephrine initiation in patients with septic shock, and the five studies included in our meta-analysis have different definitions of the early and late groups. We listed a table (Table 3) to illustrate each author's definition of the early and late groups. The recent Hour-1 Bundle supported by the SSC recommends starting vasopressors within the first hour of resuscitation if initial fluid loading does not restore minimum MAP. Indeed, norepinephrine infusion can be safely started before ICU admission, even in intermediate care without intensivist supervision. Delays in initiation of vasopressor therapy following the first documentation of hypotension in septic shock are modestly associated with increased specific organ failure and mortality risk. We now need a large multicenter phase 3 RCT of early norepinephrine initiation powered for mortality and organ dysfunction. In a word, early may be better.

### Cardiac arrest due to accidental overdose with norepinephrine dissolved in crystalloid [^1167aud5]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

After cessation of the pre-hospital norepinephrine infusion, the patient stabilised within 10 min and did not require vasopressor support nor sedation. He received approximately 3 mg of norepinephrine from arrival to the ED over a span of about 20 min and 4 mg in total, equivalent to a dose of approximately 4 µg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹. Post-arrest, the patient had marked mydriasis bilaterally with no discernible response to light initially. ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no overt signs of ischaemia. High-sensitivity serial troponin measurements were within normal limits. On stabilisation a non-contrast CT scan of the head was performed to exclude intracranial haemorrhage, which was normal. The patient was extubated later that day and discharged from the ICU on day 2 without neurological or cardiac sequelae for further mental health evaluation.

A hot debrief was performed with the team involved in the patient's care immediately after resuscitation. There was no clear conclusion as to a single cause of the incident, but several factors were highlighted as contributory: a poorly labelled drug dilution, accidental re-initiation of norepinephrine as a bolus by a staff member unaware of the dilution, failure to remove the bag instead of just stopping the infusion and a relatively late recognition of ongoing bolus infusion. The adverse incident was reported and a root cause analysis was performed at a later stage, with all parties from the pre-hospital and in-hospital setting debriefed and action plans implemented to improve future care.

### Norepinephrine bitartrate [^1153gqsh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	MAO-Inhibiting Drugs

Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension.

If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension.

7.2 	Tricyclic Antidepressants

Co-administration of norepinephrine bitartrate with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine bitartrate cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension.

7.3	Antidiabetics

Norepinephrine bitartrate can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs.

7.4	Halogenated Anesthetics

Concomitant use of norepinephrine bitartrate with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics.

### Mobilisation of critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine: a retrospective cohort study [^1113pbfs]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study explored the effect of norepinephrine on the mobilisation and safety of these mobilisations. Patients receiving norepinephrine were less likely to be mobilised early, were mobilised less often and were mobilised mostly in-bed only.

The delay in initiation of mobilisation and the reduced frequency of mobilisation is not surprising, with hemodynamic instability being one of the main barriers to the mobilisation of critically ill patients. Higher norepinephrine dosages were associated with decreased mobilisation level for patients who received a continuous norepinephrine application. Mobilisation during norepinephrine administration was predominantly (73%) in-bed, while a minority (45%) of mobilisation was in-bed without noradrenaline administration. The important difference between these mobilisation forms is the verticalisation of the patients. These postural changes are accompanied by haemodynamic changes and strain on the blood pressure regulation of the patients. As an increase in achieved IMS levels also leads to more strain on the circulatory system, an increase in adverse events (mainly being hypotension) would be physiologically understandable.

### Serious adverse events associated with vasopressin and norepinephrine infusion in septic shock [^1165H49q]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The frequency, risk factors, and mortality rates of serious adverse events associated with the use of vasopressin and norepinephrine are not clear. The objectives of this study were to determine frequency, risk factors (including candidate gene polymorphisms), and outcomes of serious adverse events in septic shock patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study using multicenter discovery and single-center validation cohorts.

Setting

ICUs at academic teaching centers.

Patients

Five hundred ninety-seven patients with septic shock in discovery (Vasopressin and Septic Shock trial) and 533 patients in validation (St. Paul's Hospital) cohorts.

Intervention

Vasopressin and norepinephrine for septic shock.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome variable was 90-day mortality rates of patients with and without serious adverse events. Secondary outcome variables were the association between vasopressor genotype pathway polymorphisms, plasma vasopressin levels, and serious adverse events. Plasma vasopressin concentrations were measured at baseline, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after vasopressor infusion. Patients with septic shock were genotyped for 268 vasopressor pathway tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Serious adverse events occurred in 10.5% and 9.7% of patients in Vasopressin and Septic Shock trial and St. Paul's Hospital cohorts, respectively. Patients who had serious adverse events had higher mortality (p < 0.01) than patients without serious adverse events (adjusted for age, serum lactate, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, and maximum dose of norepinephrine day 1) (hazard ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.20–4.00; p < 0.001 and hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.26–2.85; p = 0.002 in Vasopressin and Septic Shock trial and St. Paul's Hospital, respectively). There was no difference in the area under the plasma vasopressin concentration curve between patients with and without serious adverse events (p = 0.1). The AA genotype of rs28418396 single-nucleotide polymorphism (near the arginine vasopressin receptor 1b gene) was significantly associated with serious adverse events in discovery and validation cohorts (p = 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively).

Conclusion

Serious adverse events associated with vasopressin and norepinephrine in patients who have septic shock are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. AA genotype of rs28418396 single-nucleotide polymorphism near the arginine vasopressin receptor 1b gene is associated with serious adverse events. The mechanism of this association requires investigation.

Post-hoc analysis

When categorising noradrenaline doses reported in the studies included in the dose-response meta-analysis into three predefined intervals based on the updated SOFA-2 score, ≤ 0.2, > 0.2 to ≤ 0.4, and > 0.4 µg/kg/min; a statistically significant difference in mortality was observed across dose categories, with mortality of 16.5% (n = 1279/7773), 31.9% (n = 1175/3682), and 40.3% (n = 3609/8964) in the ≤ 0.2, > 0.2 to ≤ 0.4, and > 0.4 µg/kg/min categories, respectively (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons confirmed significant differences between all groups (p < 0.001). The distribution of patients was as follows: 38% (n = 7773) in the ≤ 0.2 µg/kg/min category, 18% (n = 3682) in the > 0.2 to ≤ 0.4 µg/kg/min category and 44% (n = 8964) in the > 0.4 µg/kg/min category (Additional file 10).

Certainty of the evidence

The results of the GRADE assessment are reported in Table 3. The overall certainty was rated as moderate, based on consistent findings across observational studies and the magnitude of the association.

### Norepinephrine bitartrate [^116iQPmg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

Norepinephrine (sometimes referred to as l-arterenol/Levarterenol or l-norepinephrine) is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom.

Norepinephrine bitartrate, USP is (-)-α-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol tartrate (1:1) (salt), monohydrate (molecular weight 337.28 g/mol) and has the following structural formula:

Norepinephrine bitartrate injection, USP is supplied in a sterile aqueous solution in the form of the bitartrate salt to be administered by intravenous infusion. Norepinephrine is freely soluble in purified water slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Each mL contains 1 mg of norepinephrine base (equivalent to 1.89 mg of norepinephrine bitartrate, USP anhydrous basis), sodium chloride for isotonicity, not more than 0.2 mg (vials) of sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant. It has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5. The air in the containers has been displaced by nitrogen gas.

### Association of arterial blood pressure and vasopressor load with septic shock mortality: a post hoc analysis of a multicenter trial [^1162q6iT]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis related to catecholamine therapy has been typically observed during epinephrine infusion and may originate from epinephrine-related acceleration of metabolism and/or induction of tissue hypoperfusion. In earlier studies, catecholamines have repeatedly been associated with disease-related events on cardiac function ranging from ischemia to myocardial stunning and apoptosis. Tachycardia is a particularly common and well-known side effect of catecholamine therapy. The significant association between heart rate during the shock period and 28-day mortality in this patient population confirms the results of an earlier prospective observational study in 48 septic shock patients. Whereas beneficial effects of vasopressors have been reported and adrenergic vasopressors are recommended as first-line agents in septic shock, we observed an independent association between the mean vasopressor load during shock and both the development of disease-related events as well as death at day 28. Two recent studies reporting adverse effects of catecholamine vasopressors on organ function and mortality in septic shock support our results. Furthermore, the findings of the present analysis are in line with earlier data suggesting harmful effects of excess catecholamine exposition in general critically ill patient populations. For example, Boldt and colleagues showed that circulating plasma levels of catecholamines were higher in non-surviving when compared with surviving surgical intensive care unit patients. A randomized trial that investigated the outcome effects of supranormal oxygen delivery in a diverse group of critically ill patients reported higher in-hospital mortality in patients receiving liberal catecholamine therapy than in control patients exposed to standard care.

### Minimizing catecholamines and optimizing perfusion [^114vNymz]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shock, whatever its cause, is characterized by a decrease in tissue perfusion, associated with cellular and metabolic abnormalities. The base of shock resuscitation is to improve tissue perfusion by restoring perfusion pressure of vital organs, ensuring an adequate cardiac output and, if possible, improving microvascular alterations. Several interventions can be considered, including fluids, vasopressor, and inotropic agents. Each of these interventions has adverse effects. A positive fluid balance is associated with an increased risk of death. Interestingly, this study reported that the positive fluid balance was mostly due to a lower fluid output (mostly diuresis) while the amount of fluids administered to the patients did not differ between survivors and non-survivors. Hence, it is impossible to differentiate the impact of disease severity from a direct negative effect of fluids. Nevertheless, it sounds reasonable to avoid excessive fluid administration. As an alternative to fluids, vasoactive agents can be proposed. Vasopressive and inotropic catecholamines are life-saving interventions in several circumstances, but these agents are also associated with important adverse events. Tachycardia, arrhythmias, and metabolic, thermogenic, and immunologic effects are the most noticeable ones, but other adverse effects may also occur. In addition, vasopressive catecholamines may be associated with excessive vasoconstriction which may result in an impairment in tissue perfusion, even when perfusion pressure is restored. However, non-adrenergic vasopressors are also associated with some adverse effects, and switching from adrenergic to non-adrenergic vasopressors is not always optimal. Similarly, non-catecholaminergic inotropic agents may also be associated with adverse effects including tachycardia, digital necrosis, or splanchnic ischemia. Accordingly, the challenge in managing critically ill patients is to find the right balance between fluids, adrenergic and, eventually, non-adrenergic vasopressors, and inotropic agents. In this paper, we will focus on septic shock and discuss the different possibilities to optimize tissue perfusion and catecholamine use.

### Association of noradrenaline dose with mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116P4tgc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-hoc analysis

This dose-response meta-analysis was initially conceived to obtain data for the SOFA score update. After the SOFA-2 Working group had determined the noradrenaline dose cutoffs for the new score, we conducted post hoc analyses to evaluate the concordance between our findings and these thresholds. To this end, we stratified noradrenaline doses according to the SOFA-2 cutoffs (0.2 µg/kg/min and 0.4 µg/kg/min) and assessed mortality and patient distribution across these categories.

Assessment of risk of bias

For the primary outcome, we intended to assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised controlled trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. As no randomised controlled trials were identified, two authors (IL, LD) independently and in duplicate assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies using only the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Disagreements over RoB were resolved by consensus or, if necessary, adjudicated by a third author (MR).

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assesses studies based on three broad categories: selection, comparability, and outcome (for cohort studies) or exposure (for case-control studies). Each study is awarded up to nine points across these categories. We considered studies as of low risk of bias if they scored 7 to 9 points, intermediate risk of bias if they scored 4 to 6 points, and high risk of bias if they scored 3 points or fewer.

Certainty of the evidence

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence (i.e. the overall effect estimate) for the primary outcome.

### Cardiac arrest due to accidental overdose with norepinephrine dissolved in crystalloid [^1121UvhF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Vasoactive agents should be administered through a controlled well-marked infusor pump, ideally via a central venous catheter if given over longer periods of time. During transfer of haemodynamically unstable patients with limited staffing and resources on site, a peripheral vasopressor infusion is sometimes resorted to as a temporary measure of optimising haemodynamic parameters. We report a case of accidental norepinephrine overdose after such practice, resulting in cardiac arrest. It illustrates the importance of careful use and labelling of vasoactive agents during the transport and handover of critically ill patients. Finally, we explore human factor issues associated with transfer from the pre-hospital to the in-hospital environment when such preparations are used.

### Adverse events associated with administration of vasopressor medications through a peripheral intravenous catheter: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114tndwm]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of patients that received PIV vasopressors

The characteristics of patients who received PIV vasopressors are presented in Additional file 1: Table S3. In the 10 adult studies that reported age and sex, average (mean or median) age ranged from 36 to 81 years and most study participants were male (1089/2051, 53%). In adult studies, norepinephrine was the most commonly administered vasopressor (15,584 cases in 9 studies), followed by phenylephrine (546 cases in 4 studies), epinephrine (261 cases in 4 studies), and dopamine (151 cases in 6 studies). Average PIV vasopressor infusion duration was reported in 10 adult studies, and ranged from 1.3 to 49 h, with half (n = 5) of studies reporting an average duration between 12 and 24 h. In the six adult studies that reported the size of the PIV used to administer vasopressors, 88% of PIV vasopressor infusions were through PIVs that were 16–20 gauge (1283/1464), of which most were through a 20-gauge PIV (888/1464, 61%). Seven adult studies commented on the anatomical location of PIV, of which four quantified how many infusions were recorded through each location. From these studies, 64% (446/692) of vasopressors were administered through a PIV in the arm proximal to the wrist and 27% (188/692) were administered in the hand or wrist.

In the seven studies done in children, the average age ranged from 1 day to 9.3 years. Dopamine was the most commonly administered vasopressor and was administered to patients in all of the child studies (n = 7), followed by epinephrine (n = 4 studies), and norepinephrine (n = 3 studies). Most of the studies in children (n = 5) described patients receiving multiple vasopressors, with one study explicitly describing patients receiving multiple vasopressors simultaneously through the same PIV. Average duration of infusion was reported in five child studies and ranged from 3 to 36.5 h, with most (n = 3 studies) reporting a duration under six hours. Gauge was reported in four studies with 24 gauge as most common PIV size.

### Vasopressin versus norepinephrine infusion in patients with septic shock [^111zFPZv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock, but its effect on mortality is unknown. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 microg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 microg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions.

Results

A total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P = 0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P = 0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P = 1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P = 0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P = 0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Low-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN94845869 [controlled-trials.com].).

### Association of noradrenaline dose with mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114PS87h]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Circulatory failure is common in critical illness, and it may lead to multiple organ failure if not promptly addressed. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is currently the most commonly used vasopressor to manage acute hypotension and circulatory failure. Noradrenaline has multiple actions including immunomodulation and cardiovascular effects. It is used to increase blood pressure through vasoconstriction. Moreover, it may enhance cardiac output through venous constriction that leads to increased venous return, by improving critically low diastolic blood pressures to enhance coronary perfusion, and through possible inotropic effects.

The administration and the dose of vasopressor medication are indicative of the severity of circulatory failure. The most widely used organ dysfunction score, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, includes dopamine, dobutamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline dose thresholds to quantify cardiovascular dysfunction. However, clinical practice has changed since the introduction of SOFA in 1996: use of noradrenaline has become more common and it is initiated earlier, whereas dopamine use has decreased. This has caused limitations in the cardiovascular component of the original SOFA: even a high score based on the dose of noradrenaline may not indicate a life-threatening circulatory failure.

Recently, an international group of experts has proposed updating the SOFA score to align with current clinical practice, and the SOFA-2 score has been developed. As part of this update, the SOFA-2 Task Force proposed two thresholds for noradrenaline dose, 0.2 and 0.4 µg/kg/min, to define severity categories of cardiovascular dysfunction. Our group pertaining to the cardiovascular organ system within the SOFA-2, conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between noradrenaline dose and mortality. This analysis specifically sought to refine the cardiovascular component of the SOFA score by determining more accurate cutoff values for vasopressor doses, particularly noradrenaline, as a marker of circulatory dysfunction severity. While supporting the SOFA-2 revision, it also aimed to provide a clinically interpretable synthesis of available evidence for the broader intensive care community. Specifically, our objective was to determine whether a consistent dose–mortality association could be identified and quantified, in order to inform clinical decision-making and enhance risk awareness in patients receiving vasopressor therapy.

### The impact of norepinephrine dose reporting heterogeneity on mortality prediction in septic shock patients [^114DkA5w]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Norepinephrine (NE) is a ubiquitously used vasoactive drug in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is considered a first line vasopressor in the management of septic shock. The NE dose has traditionally been used as a clinical proxy for circulatory dysfunction and overall disease severity, and as such, it has been included in prognostic scores (i.e. SOFA score). It has also been used to define refractory shock and as a trigger for additional therapies (i.e. vasopressin or corticosteroids). NE dose, either at diagnosis or its peak, has also been associated with mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. Thus, it has become one of the most relevant bedside compasses for clinical decision-making.

Several salt formulations of NE (tartrate, bitartrate, or hydrochloride) are available in worldwide markets, with the preparation used varying between and even within countries. Each salt has unique conversion rates to norepinephrine base, the drug's active molecule. A recent expert consensus raised awareness of the heterogeneity of NE dose reporting, as clinicians and researchers often fail to specify whether the administered doses are reported as salt or as its base molecule equivalent. In fact, two large surveys showed that around 50% of respondents are unaware of on which formulation is NE reported locally and, therefore, administered in their practice, leading to potential guideline interpretation disagreements between practitioners. This variability could hinder the correct application of time-sensitive clinical interventions, the comparison of results between centers, and multicentric research initiatives.

A crucial aspect of this reporting heterogeneity is its effect on the prognostic capacity of NE dosing. Clinicians frequently use NE dose as a risk assessment tool, often relying on specific dose cut-offs. For instance, a dose of more than 1.0 µg/kg/min has been associated with very high mortality. Extrapolating these thresholds from literature to clinical practice without proper standardization of dose reporting could introduce bias in mortality prediction and induce communication errors (between healthcare providers and with family members), eventually impairing the overall care process.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the heterogeneity of NE dose reporting on risk prediction in septic shock patients. We hypothesized that reporting NE dose either as base molecule or salts would generate considerable variations in mortality risk assessment. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a cohort of septic shock patients from the MIMIC-IV database, in which NE dose was transformed from base molecule dose to equivalent doses for different salts and analyzed the predicted mortality at commonly used severity dose cut-offs.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^114XvnxX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The impact of different vasoactive or inotropic medications on kidney function varies and may depend on the underlying condition. The most frequently used vasopressor to maintain renal perfusion pressure is norepinephrine. The effects of phenylephrine, a pure α-1 agonist, on renal function are poorly investigated, but without evidence for benefit. Catecholamines may have side effects at higher doses. Vasopressin, an endogenous non-catecholamine vasopressor, has the ability to preferentially constrict efferent glomerular arterioles, thus increasing glomerular perfusion pressure and urine generation. While in the Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine as Initial Therapy in Septic Shock (VANISH) trial, the number of kidney failure-free days was similar in patients who received noradrenaline or vasopressin, patients in the vasopressin group had lower Scr levels and higher urinary output in the first 7 days, leading to lower use of RRT (25.4% vs. 35.3%). A meta-analysis including 4 RCTs concluded that vasopressin reduced the requirement for RRT (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74–0.99), but this finding was not robust to sensitivity analyses. More recently, the Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine in Patients with Vasoplegic Shock after Cardiac Surgery (VANCS) trial demonstrated a significantly better primary composite outcome in patients randomized to vasopressin versus norepinephrine, an effect primarily driven by a lower rate of AKI. Angiotensin II infusion has recently been investigated in patients with shock demonstrating equal hemodynamic stabilization as achieved by norepinephrine (ATHOS-3). A post hoc analysis of this trial showed that in a subgroup of patients on RRT, duration of RRT was shorter and survival higher in patients who received angiotensin-II compared to norepinephrine, a finding that warrants confirmation. Naturally, potential impact on kidney function should always be weighed against potential adverse effects.

### Selepressin, a novel selective vasopressin vagonist, is an effective substitute for norepinephrine in a phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled trial in septic shock patients [^116kHCUC]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Study outcomes

The co-primary endpoints were stabilization of MAP as determined by proportion of patients maintaining a MAP > 60 mmHg without open-label norepinephrine at 12, 24, 48, and 96 h, and day 7; infusion rates and cumulative dose of open-label norepinephrine; and proportion of patients maintaining a MAP > 60 mmHg at 12, 24, 48, and 96 h, and day 7, regardless of open-label norepinephrine administration. The limit for maintained MAP was defined as 60 mmHg to prevent small variations around the clinical treatment target of 65 mmHg having disproportional impact on the overall evaluation.

Secondary endpoints included pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety (vital signs, central venous pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, electrocardiographic and cardiac function, respiratory function, clinical chemistry, hematology, hemostasis, and urinalysis), organ dysfunction, an indirect measure of vascular leakage (i.e. fluid balance), and morbidity. Treatment-emergent adverse events (occurrence from start of study drug to 48 h after infusion was stopped) were collated and evaluated. Morbidity and organ dysfunction were evaluated by time course of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores; days alive and free of organ dysfunction (using SOFA); proportion of patients off all vasopressors; days alive and out of intensive care unit (ICU); days alive and free of vasopressors; corticosteroids for sepsis treatment, dialysis, or mechanical ventilation at days 7, 14, and 28; ICU and hospital (up to day 28) lengths of stay; and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra levels.

Pharmacokinetics

Because the study drug infusion was administered according to need, the pharmacokinetic parameters steady-state concentration, total systemic clearance, distribution volume at steady state, and half-life were calculated by modeling using a two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with random subject effects on clearance and distribution volume using WinNonlin®Pro (Pharsight Corp. Cary, NC, USA). Actual blood sampling time points were used for the calculations.

### Exploration of different statistical approaches in the comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock: SOAP II [^1142JeYb]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Choice of vasopressor is a crucial issue in patients with shock admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Dopamine was commonly used as first line vasopressor in patients with shock; however, norepinephrine has been favoured over the last couple decades after trials suggesting that norepinephrine could be associated with improved outcomes and fewer adverse effects. The landmark trial comparing norepinephrine and dopamine is the Comparison of Dopamine and Norepinephrine in the Treatment of Shock trial (SOAP II) which enrolled 1679 critically ill patients with shock to either norepinephrine or dopamine. SOAP II reported neutral results for the primary outcome of 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.42; p = 0.10). However, the trial found important differences, including more adverse events with dopamine.

Interpreting neutral clinical trials that include a heterogeneous population is challenging. On one hand, the effect size of SOAP II points towards possible harm with the use of dopamine; and a secondary subgroup analysis suggested that harm could be driven mostly by patients with cardiogenic shock, but the p -value for interaction was 0.12, making a strong statement not completely compatible under the frequentist framework. In addition, physicians continue to use dopamine as a vasopressor agent, suggesting that it may still be considered suitable in some conditions. There is growing interest for different statistical methods that can either provide hierarchical assessment of composite endpoints (such as the win ratio [WR]), probabilistic statements on the results (mostly through Bayesian methods) and exploring heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE), which may provide additional information from randomized trials.

We therefore reanalyzed the SOAP II trial using different statistical methods, including a hierarchical assessment of composite endpoints using WR, Bayesian reanalysis accounting for interaction of shock type and intervention, probabilistic methods of HTE based on risk and effect-based approaches. We hypothesized that these methods would provide additional insights that would both serve to showcase novel methods of analysis for randomized trials and augment the findings from the original SOAP II results.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^111PC3YS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current shock guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) and eventually restore tissue perfusion. Norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is an endogenous catecholamine, produced both in postganglionic sympathetic nerves and adrenal glands. It became part of the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of shock during the 1950s, gaining traction ever since. Despite its ubiquitous use throughout intensive care units (ICUs) and operating rooms worldwide, clinical practice related to its administration is still heterogeneous. We provide here a concise and practical article on the fundamentals of vasopressor administration in critically ill patients, using norepinephrine as a paradigmatic case example.

Inotropes evidence and cautions in septic shock — Dobutamine and epinephrine are the most commonly used inotropes, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared dobutamine to placebo and mortality effects are unclear, so the panel issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations and both should be discontinued if ineffective or harmful. Indirect comparison from network meta-analysis showed that dobutamine with norepinephrine had no clear impact on mortality compared to no inotropic agents (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47). In an observational study of 420 patients with septic shock, inotrope use was independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94). No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine, and an indirect comparison showed no clear effect on mortality (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47–3.97). Dobutamine infusion may produce severe vasodilation and result in lower MAP, and the inotropic response may be blunted in sepsis with a preserved chronotropic effect causing tachycardia without an increase in stroke volume. The panel considered the network meta-analysis as a higher quality than observational studies and issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations, and both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse events.

### Risk of major complications after perioperative norepinephrine infusion through peripheral intravenous lines in a multicenter study [^112xsi6c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous infusions of norepinephrine to treat perioperative hypotension are typically administered through a central venous line rather than a peripheral venous catheter to avoid the risk of localized tissue necrosis in case of drug extravasation. There is limited literature to estimate the risk of skin necrosis when peripheral norepinephrine is used to counteract anesthesia-associated hypotension in elective surgical cases. This study aimed to estimate the rate of occurrence of drug-related adverse effects, including skin necrosis requiring surgical management when norepinephrine peripheral extravasation occurs.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used the perioperative databases of the University Hospitals in Amsterdam and Utrecht, the Netherlands, to identify surgical patients who received norepinephrine peripheral intravenous infusions (20 µg/mL) between 2012 and 2016. The risk of drug-related adverse effects, including skin necrosis, was estimated. Particular care was taken to identify patients who needed plastic surgical or medical attention secondary to extravasation of dilute, peripheral norepinephrine.

Results

A total of 14,385 patients who received norepinephrine peripheral continuous infusions were identified. Drug extravasation was observed in 5 patients (5/14,385 = 0.035%). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for infusion extravasation was 0.011%-0.081%, indicating an estimated risk of 1–8 events per every 10,000 patients. There were zero related complications requiring surgical or medical intervention, resulting in a 95% CI of 0%-0.021% and indicating a risk of approximately 0–2 events per 10,000 patients.

Conclusions

In the current database analysis, no significant association was found between the use of peripheral intravenous norepinephrine infusions and adverse events.

### Association of noradrenaline dose with mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114dEqmq]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and unadjusted dose-response meta-analysis revealed that there may be an exponential association between increasing noradrenaline dose and relative risk of death among ICU patients, up to 1.25 µg/kg/min, up to 1.25 µg/kg/min. There were no clear inflection points or thresholds that would be logical choices as cutoffs to inform the SOFA score update. Instead, we observed a consistent increase in mortality risk, with the relative risk multiplied by an approximate factor of 1.5 for every 0.1 µg/kg/min increase in peak noradrenaline dose. This observation should raise awareness among clinicians managing patients with vasopressor-dependent shock. An increase as small as 0.1 µg/kg/min was consistently associated with higher mortality. Recognizing this may help identify patients whose cardiovascular failure is worsening, despite ongoing support. It may support earlier consideration of adjunctive vasopressors, re-evaluation of source control, volemia or cardiac function, or timely escalation of care. This dose–mortality relationship provides clinicians with a practical, interpretable marker of severity that can inform bedside decisions in real time.

Our systematic review identified a wide variety of methods used to report noradrenaline dose and mortality in terms of units (weight-based or absolute), variable used (starting dose, mean dose, peak dose or cumulative dose) and time window of observation (from noradrenaline starting timepoint to the whole duration of ICU stay). This variety greatly impairs the possibility to draw firm conclusions from the existing literature. We focused on the peak noradrenaline dose for the statistical analysis, because it was most commonly reported and because of its clinical relevance. However, we acknowledge that other estimators, such as time-weighted mean dose or cumulative exposure, may provide additional insight into vasopressor burden and severity trajectories. In particular, prior studies, including the study by Auchet et al. have suggested that mean dose may outperform peak dose in predicting mortality in selected subgroups such as patients with refractory septic shock. Furthermore, the dose-response meta-analysis was based on publications that reported noradrenaline only or noradrenaline-equivalent to account for the use of other vasopressors.

### Angiotensin II: a new approach for refractory shock management? [^116HUxNE]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In a previous issue of Critical Care, Chawla and colleagues tested, in a phase II randomized controlled trial, the hemodynamic effects of angiotensin II, a natural vasopressor hormone without any inotrope or chronotrope effects. In critically ill patients, distributive shock is mainly represented by septic shock. Its mortality rate, after having decreased as the result of the implementation of specific guidelines, still remains unacceptable at about 30% in most recent cohort studies. Vasopressor-refractory hypotension is the last stage before death. Vascular hyporesponsiveness to catecholamines has numerous origins, including nitric oxide overproduction, upregulation of prostacyclin, excessive activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and desensitization of alpha adrenoreceptors. Administration of very high doses of catecholamines is a strategy to consider, albeit with many potential side effects such as tachyarrhythmia or myocardial cell damage.

The present study of Chawla and colleagues was designed to determine the appropriate dose of angiotensin II in the setting of distributive shock with high cardiac flow. The authors found an almost significant reduction in norepinephrine dosing at a dose range of 1 to 40 ng/kg/minute whereas a rebound of norepinephrine dosing was systematically noticed upon angiotensin II cessation. No clinically relevant adverse effect other than metabolic alkalosis was experienced with angiotensin infusion.

This first clinical trial on the use of angiotensin II in distributive shock raises many questions. Undoubtedly, angiotensin II appears to be an effective vasopressor even if statistical significance was never reached in this trial. Nevertheless, one question should be debated: is there actually a need for a new vasopressor therapy? This intentionally provocative issue reflects the limited literature on the consequences of high catecholamine dosing in refractory shock. First, the maximum tolerable dose is still unknown. Second, even though excessive dosing is associated with tissue hypoperfusion, it is more likely that, in a refractory shock state, adverse ischemic effects are rather related to the shock itself. Finally, in a recent retrospective study, high-dose norepinephrine, particularly in the early phase of septic shock, was not predictive of death. In the present study, patients did not receive high catecholamine dosing. Consequently, patients for whom this new vasopressor therapy could be beneficial were not identified.

### Norepinephrine pressor infusion withdrawal in a national health service hospice [^116wa9VT]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Norepinephrine (NE) is a peripheral vasoconstrictor used as an emergency measure to restore blood pressure secondary to acute hypotension. NE must be administered centrally as a continuous infusion and requires intensive monitoring. Consequently, its use is restricted to critical care environments. We discuss the withdrawal of NE in a hospice for a patient with advanced malignancy and profound hypotension from sepsis. The patient was admitted to intensive care but chose to stop active treatment and insisted on being discharged. Due to concerns about withdrawing NE in the community, he was transferred to a local hospice. We describe various challenges, including the administration and monitoring of NE outside of intensive care, the withdrawal process and concerns that profound hypotension might compromise subcutaneous medications absorption.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — inotropes for adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure: "we suggest either adding dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone" and "we suggest against using levosimendan" (both, "Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence"). Evidence cited includes that "No RCTs compared dobutamine to placebo", network meta-analysis found dobutamine with norepinephrine had "no clear impact on mortality" versus no inotrope (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47), and an observational study linked inotrope use with increased 90‑day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94). "No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine", and an indirect comparison showed "no clear effect on mortality" (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47–3.97). The panel "issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations", and "Both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse events".

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^113iQevL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Vasopressors via peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters — safety and initiation strategy: Extravasation occurred in 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5–4.7%) with no reported episodes of tissue necrosis or limb ischemia, and a meta-analysis reported that 85% of events occurred when catheters were distal to the antecubital fossa; administration for a short period of time (< 6 hours) in a well-placed catheter proximal to the antecubital fossa is unlikely to cause local tissue injury. A post-hoc analysis reported that 42% had vasopressors initiated via a peripheral catheter with shorter time to initiation (2.4 [1.3–3.9] vs. 4.9 hours [3.5–6.6], p < 0.001), and most patients started peripherally achieved a MAP > 65 mmHg within 1 hour. Therefore, we issued a weak recommendation in favor of the rapid initiation of vasopressors peripherally. If the infusion of vasopressors is still needed after a short period of time, as soon as practical and if resources are available, they should be infused through a central venous access to minimize the risk of complications. Though the panel suggests peripheral administration of norepinephrine as a temporizing measure until a central venous catheter can be placed, its longer-term central administration may not be possible in some settings.

### Effect of selepressin vs placebo on ventilator-and vasopressor-free days in patients with septic shock: the SEPSIS-ACT randomized clinical trial [^112XqCqL]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Norepinephrine, the first-line vasopressor for septic shock, is not always effective and has important catecholaminergic adverse effects. Selepressin, a selective vasopressin V1a receptor agonist, is a noncatecholaminergic vasopressor that may mitigate sepsis-induced vasodilatation, vascular leakage, and edema, with fewer adverse effects.

Objective

To test whether selepressin improves outcome in septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An adaptive phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial comprising 2 parts that included adult patients (n = 868) with septic shock requiring more than 5 μg/min of norepinephrine. Part 1 used a Bayesian algorithm to adjust randomization probabilities to alternative selepressin dosing regimens and to trigger transition to part 2, which would compare the best-performing regimen with placebo. The trial was conducted between July 2015 and August 2017 in 63 hospitals in Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, and follow-up was completed by May 2018.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 3 dosing regimens of selepressin (starting infusion rates of 1.7, 2.5, and 3.5 ng/kg/min; n = 585) or to placebo (n = 283), all administered as continuous infusions titrated according to hemodynamic parameters.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was ventilator- and vasopressor-free days within 30 days (deaths assigned zero days) of commencing study drug. Key secondary end points were 90-day mortality, kidney replacement therapy-free days, and ICU-free days.

Results

Among 868 randomized patients, 828 received study drug (mean age, 66.3 years; 341 [41.2%] women) and comprised the primary analysis cohort, of whom 562 received 1 of 3 selepressin regimens, 266 received placebo, and 817 (98.7%) completed the trial. The trial was stopped for futility at the end of part 1. Median study drug duration was 37.8 hours (IQR, 17.8–72.4). There were no significant differences in the primary end point (ventilator- and vasopressor-free days: 15.0 vs 14.5 in the selepressin and placebo groups; difference, 0.6 [95% CI, -1.3 to 2.4]; P = 0.30) or key secondary end points (90-day mortality, 40.6% vs 39.4%; difference, 1.1% [95% CI, -6.5% to 8.8%]; P = 0.77; kidney replacement therapy-free days: 18.5 vs 18.2; difference, 0.3 [95% CI, -2.1 to 2.6]; P = 0.85; ICU-free days: 12.6 vs 12.2; difference, 0.5 [95% CI, -1.2 to 2.2]; P = 0.41). Adverse event rates included cardiac arrhythmias (27.9% vs 25.2% of patients), cardiac ischemia (6.6% vs 5.6%), mesenteric ischemia (3.2% vs 2.6%), and peripheral ischemia (2.3% vs 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine, administration of selepressin, compared with placebo, did not result in improvement in vasopressor- and ventilator-free days within 30 days. Further research would be needed to evaluate the potential role of selepressin for other patient-centered outcomes in septic shock.

Vasoactive agents — rationale and supporting evidence note that "Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine as a vasoconstrictor", and a "systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs" found "a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and lower risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine". A "randomized blinded study comparing epinephrine with norepinephrine in patients with shock showed no difference in 90-day mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63–1.25) and vasopressor-free days". Regarding vasopressin, levels "decrease to normal range in most patients between 24 and 48 hours" and it "is usually administered at a fixed dose of 0.03 units/min" with "up to 0.06 units/min" used in clinical trials; in VANISH, "There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in 28-day mortality".

Additional therapies — corticosteroids: For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy we suggest using IV corticosteroids (weak recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). The typical corticosteroid is IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg/d given as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion, and initiation is suggested when the dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine is ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation. The guideline-defined ongoing requirement was a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 hours after initiation to maintain the target MAP, and the dose of hydrocortisone is typically 200 mg/d. A meta-analysis conducted for this guideline review found an increase vasopressor-free days (MD, 1.5 days; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.11 days); however, corticosteroid use increased neuromuscular weakness (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.45), without a clear effect on short- or long-term mortality. Recent RCTs used 200 mg per day of IV hydrocortisone in divided doses, with inclusion criteria such as any dose of vasopressor or inotrope for ≥ 4 hours to maintain a MAP > 60mm Hg in ADRENAL, or vasopressor thresholds of ≥ 0.25 μg/kg/min or ≥ 1 mg/hr for at least 6 hours to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in APROCCHSS, and hydrocortisone courses included a maximum of seven days or until ICU discharge or death, seven days, or 200 mg daily for 5 days then tapered over further 6 days depending on the trial.

### Adrenergic downregulation in critical care: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic evidence [^1141d9mM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Catecholamines remain the mainstay of therapy for acute cardiovascular dysfunction. However, adrenergic receptors quickly undergo desensitization and downregulation after prolonged stimulation. Moreover, prolonged exposure to high circulating catecholamines levels is associated with several adverse effects on different organ systems. Unfortunately, in critically ill patients, adrenergic downregulation translates into progressive reduction of cardiovascular response to exogenous catecholamine administration, leading to refractory shock. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in recent years toward use of noncatecholaminergic inotropes and vasopressors. Several studies investigating a wide variety of catecholamine-sparing strategies (eg, levosimendan, vasopressin, β-blockers, steroids, and use of mechanical circulatory support) have been published recently. Use of these agents was associated with improvement in hemodynamics and decreased catecholamine use but without a clear beneficial effect on major clinical outcomes. Accordingly, additional research is needed to define the optimal management of catecholamine-resistant shock.

### In-line filtration of intravenous infusion may reduce organ dysfunction of adult critical patients [^113LP6xY]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our propensity-matched cohort analysis, the routine use of finer 0.2 and 1.2 μm in-line filters compared to larger 5 μm control filters had no beneficial effects on the rate of catecholamines and on AKI, but was associated with decreased markers of inflammation and a decreased risk of respiratory dysfunction, sepsis, pneumonia, and slightly reduced length of ICU and in-hospital stay. In this respect, we postulate a clinical relevance for patients on intensive care units.

Microparticle-contaminated infusions and drugs may have adverse effects in critically ill patients and are suspected to be responsible for unspecific inflammation that might lead to different organ manifestations. Post-mortem studies have demonstrated that a high amount of particles enters the patient if no in-line filters have been used. This might already be challenging for a healthy patient but could be even worse for severely ill patients. So far, no significant benefits of finer 0.2 and 1.2 μm in-line filters in comparison to no filters were found in a previous adult study.

Recent studies including critically ill children and new-borns instead did show a significant reduction of organ dysfunction by using in-line filters (finer 0.2 μm for aqueous solutions and 1.2 μm for lipid-containing mixtures in the filter cohort as well as only 0.2 μm for aqueous solutions but no filters for lipid-containing mixtures in the filter cohort). Interestingly, all mentioned studies used no filter in the control cohort compared to the larger 5 μm filter as intervention but that was used in our control cohort.

We initially chose to investigate a possible and clinical important manifestation of inflammation, vascular dilatation, leading to severe vasoplegia. However, vasoplegia is a complex syndrome and we tried to identify this by simply choosing high dose norepinephrine as a surrogate parameter. As a limitation, norepinephrine alone might not be the best surrogate for vasoplegia, as other reasons on a surgical ICU such as ongoing blood loss and other forms of shock might have an additional effect on our readout system.

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction and stroke may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of norepinephrine on the fetus. Animal Data A study in pregnant sheep receiving high doses of intravenous norepinephrine exhibited a significant decrease in maternal placental blood flow. Decreases in fetal oxygenation, urine and lung liquid flow were also observed.

Norepinephrine administration to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 16 or 17 resulted in cataract production in rat fetuses. In hamsters, an increased number of resorptions, fetal microscopic liver abnormalities and delayed skeletal ossification were observed at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose. Avoid administration of LEVOPHED into the veins in the leg in elderly patients. Overdosage with LEVOPHED may result in headache, severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, marked increase in peripheral resistance, and decreased cardiac output. In case of overdosage, discontinue LEVOPHED until the condition of the patient stabilizes.

Norepinephrine is a sympathomimetic amine which differs from epinephrine by the absence of a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. Rx only Warning: This is a potent drug. Dosage should be controlled by frequent determination of blood pressure. Do not leave patient unattended during administration. Avoid extravasation. Read package insert carefully. FOR INTRAVENOUS INFUSION ONLY. DILUTE BEFORE USE. DISCARD UNUSED PORTION. PROTECT FROM LIGHT.

Norepinephrine and other vasoconstrictors — comparative effectiveness and practical use: studies comparing norepinephrine with terlipressin for the treatment of HRS1 showed noninferiority of norepinephrine in reversing HRS1, and this was confirmed by meta-analysis. A recent non-ICU study used low-dose norepinephrine (starting dose: 5 μg/min, maximum dose: 10 μg/min) with cardiac monitoring to reach an MAP > 10 mm hg above baseline value and achieved a complete response in six out of 20 patients with a partial response in three additional patients. Another oral vasoconstrictor, midodrine (dosed 7.5–15 mg orally three times daily) combined with octreotide is inferior to a continuous infusion of terlipressin as a treatment for HRS1 but can be safely used in a monitored setting.

Finally, it is interesting to note that publications on misadventure in healthcare are quite rare outside of public coroner's inquests. Although reporting medical errors to patients is mandatory, no laws or codified guidelines exist on reporting of errors to colleagues. This usually takes place in the form of debriefings, morbidity and mortality meetings, and root cause analyses, which can translate to institutional memory, but deprives the wider professional community of invaluable learning opportunities.

Learning points

Adherence to drug-labelling guidelines can reduce preventable morbidity and mortality.
Norepinephrine can cause cardiac arrest in a short timespan at moderately toxic doses in humans.
A deeper understanding of human factors and implementation of sensible safety nets is essential for improving patient care.

### Using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in critical care: a systematic review of the evidence for benefit or harm [^116tkvWo]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in patients admitted to the ICU. Our objective was to systematically review available literature for evidence of benefit or harm in ICU patients resulting from chronic effects, continued use, or withdrawal.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1990 to November 2014).

Study Selection

We searched for studies of ICU patients with recorded selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor prescription before or during admission, and reporting morbidity, mortality, adverse events, and resource measures like ICU length of stay. We considered all study designs. We excluded studies of deliberate overdose and depression in non-ICU settings. Two authors independently and in duplicate screened citations and reviewed text of studies to apply selection criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors abstracted data on patient characteristics in exposed and control groups; use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors previously or during ICU; comparator intervention; and outcomes, and also assessed methodologic quality.

Data Synthesis

The database search retrieved 4,172 unique citations, of which 289 were reviewed, and 13 studies representing a total of 20,048 patients met selection criteria. There were five cohort studies, one case series, and seven case reports. Only one case report suggested benefit from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use and 11 studies reported morbidity in patients using these medications at admission to ICU. However, due to inadequate drug administration reporting, it was generally unclear if outpatient selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were continued in ICU, complicating interpretation.

Conclusions

There may be excess morbidity in critically ill selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor users, but uncertainty remains whether this is due to chronic effects, ongoing use, or drug withdrawal. Further research with improved standards of drug administration reporting is needed to help clinicians decide when to use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in critically ill patients.

Peripheral vasopressor administration in sepsis and septic shock — safety, timing, and use: Administration through peripheral IV catheters is generally safe, with extravasation in 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5–4.7%) and no reported tissue necrosis or limb ischemia; extravasation is more frequent when catheters are distal to the antecubital fossa (85%), and short-term use (< 6 hours) via a well-placed catheter proximal to the antecubital fossa is unlikely to cause local tissue injury. In a post-hoc ARISE analysis, 42% started vasopressors peripherally with shorter time to initiation (2.4 [1.3–3.9] vs. 4.9 hours [3.5–6.6], p < 0.001), and most achieved a MAP > 65 mmHg within 1 hour; delays in vasopressor initiation and achieving MAP of 65 are associated with increased mortality. Accordingly, the guideline states a "weak recommendation in favor of the rapid initiation of vasopressors peripherally", and if infusion is still required after a short period, "they should be infused through a central venous access"; the panel also "suggests peripheral administration of norepinephrine as a temporizing measure until a central venous catheter can be placed".

### Cardiac arrest due to accidental overdose with norepinephrine dissolved in crystalloid [^117ATa9Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Vasoactive agents should be administered through a controlled well-marked infusor pump, ideally via a central venous catheter if given over longer periods of time. During transport of haemodynamically unstable patients with limited staffing and resources on site, a peripheral vasopressor infusion is sometimes resorted to as a temporary measure of optimising haemodynamics. The most commonly used vasopressor in such circumstances is diluted epinephrine, where 1 mg of epinephrine (1:1000) is mixed into a given amount of crystalloid, producing a diluted solution that can be easily titrated. Other vasoactive substances can be constituted in a similar fashion or as push-dose vasopressors, but such use is highly controversial. We report a case of accidental norepinephrine overdose after such practice, resulting in cardiac arrest. It illustrates the importance of careful use and labelling of vasoactive agents during the transport and hand over of critically ill patients. Finally, it demonstrates the human factor issues associated with transfer from the pre-hospital to the in-hospital environment when such preparations are used.

### Vasopressin and terlipressin in adult vasodilatory shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials [^114XPieS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catecholamines are the most used vasopressors in vasodilatory shock. However, the development of adrenergic hyposensitivity and the subsequent loss of catecholamine pressor activity necessitate the search for other options. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of vasopressin and its analog terlipressin compared with catecholamine infusion alone in vasodilatory shock.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of publications between 1966 and 2011 was performed. The Medline and CENTRAL databases were searched for studies on vasopressin and terlipressin in critically ill patients. The meta-analysis was limited to randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of vasopressin and/or terlipressin compared with catecholamine in adult patients with vasodilatory shock. The assessed outcomes were: overall survival, changes in the hemodynamic and biochemical variables, a decrease of catecholamine requirements, and adverse events.

Results

Nine trials covering 998 participants were included. A meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model showed a reduction in norepinephrine requirement among patients receiving terlipressin or vasopressin infusion compared with control (standardized mean difference, -1.58 (95% confidence interval, -1.73 to -1.44); P < 0.0001). Overall, vasopressin and terlipressin, as compared with norepinephrine, reduced mortality (relative risk (RR), 0.87 (0.77 to 0.99); P = 0.04). Vasopressin compared with norepinephrine decreased mortality in adult patients (RR, 0.87 (0.76 to 1.00); P = 0.05) and in patients with septic shock (42.5% vs. 49.2%, respectively; RR, 0.87 (0.75 to 1.00); P = 0.05; number needed to treat, 1 to 15). There was no difference in adverse events between the vasopressin and control groups (RR, 0.98 (0.65 to 1.47); P = 0.92).

Conclusions

Vasopressin use in vasodilatory shock is safe, associated with reduced mortality, and facilitates weaning of catecholamines. In patients with septic shock, use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine may also decrease mortality.

### A clinical review of vasopressors in emergency medicine [^111TxQxg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.

Objectives Of The Review

This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.

Discussion

Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.

Conclusion

Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential when hypotension is refractory to vasopressors may help to identify adjunctive treatments in physiologic states that impair vasopressor effectiveness. Peripheral administration of vasopressors is safe and facilitates early administration, which may help to improve outcomes in some shock states.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^115HGXce]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shock is common and associated with mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). In the physiological state, blood pressure is maintained within normal range by the interplay of three major mechanisms: the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. However, in patients with vasodilatory shock, these homeostatic mechanisms are disturbed. When hypotension is not resolved solely by fluid resuscitation, vasopressor agents are the cornerstone of shock management to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

It is common among clinicians and researchers to use the dose of vasopressor agents to grade the severity of shock. Norepinephrine has been recommended as the first-line vasopressor since 2004, and the latest guidelines suggest starting vasopressin on top of norepinephrine when a target MAP is not achieved. On the other hand, many uncertainties remain in the care of shock, including how and when to start other vasopressor agents. Although new vasopressors (e.g. angiotensin II, methylene blue) have become popular in intensive care practice, there is little evidence from high-quality randomized trials and no clear recommendation in the guidelines to guide clinical decisions on when and how to initiate these new vasopressor agents so far. In addition, there are conditions where these and other vasopressors are used with or without norepinephrine, such as catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Since different vasopressors have different pharmacological characteristics and effects on hemodynamics, a calculation formula that reflects the potency of each vasopressor is frequently necessary to describe the degree of vasopressor support in a standardized manner. This is especially true when designing and conducting clinical trials.

### Reduction in insulin sensitivity following administration of the clinically used low-dose pressor, norepinephrine [^116FCtLB]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycaemia in acutely ill patients is well described and correcting this hyperglycaemia improves outcomes. It has been generally attributed to endogenous factors, specifically decreased secretion of insulin or increased secretion of anti-insulin hormones, and cytokines, or both. Norepinephrine is the most commonly used vasopressor in critically ill patients. When titrated, it has anecdotally been found to cause wide swings in blood glucose levels. We tested the hypothesis that norepinephrine, a plausible exogenous, iatrogenic cause of hyperglycaemia, causes resistance to insulin action with the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp method.

Methods

Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic (about 100 mg/dL) clamps were performed before and during infusion of norepinephrine, in doses of 110 ng·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹, which raised mean arterial pressure from 82 ± 7 to 94 ± 8 mmHg (p < 0.01) in 11 healthy adults.

Results

The glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycaemia during the clamps, a marker of whole-body insulin sensitivity, decreased from 11.2 ± 3.7 mg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ at baseline to 9.0 ± 2.6 mg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ (p = 0.015) during the norepinephrine infusion. Steady-state insulin and C-peptide levels did not significantly change. Cortisol levels showed diurnal variation in the beginning and were also different at steady state.

Conclusions

Infusion of pressor doses of norepinephrine causes resistance to insulin action in humans.

### Adverse events associated with administration of vasopressor medications through a peripheral intravenous catheter: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zuGEc]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results are consistent with prior literature examining the risks associated with PIV vasopressor administration. A prior systematic review that could not estimate incidence due to the inclusion of case series and case reports suggested adverse events appear associated with longer duration of infusion and distal PIV sites. Generalization of these results to modern practice regarding vasopressor and PIV management was limited by the fact that most included articles were published before 1970. More recently, Tian et al. examined adverse events associated with PIV vasopressor administration reported by seven cohort studies published between 2010 and 2018 that included 1362 adult patients in shock. Most included patients were admitted to ICUs. They reported a pooled extravasation rate of 3.4% (95% CI 2.5–4.6%) with none causing limb ischemia or tissue necrosis. We included 23 studies, screening all and including five of those in the systematic review of Tian et al. but also included an additional 18 studies in patients cared for outside ICUs in the ED and OR, as well as children. Our pooled adverse event rate for adults was similar to that of Tian et al. Our pooled rate for children confirms that similar to adults, the incidence of adverse events associated with PIV vasopressor administration is low. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of PIV vasopressor administration in children.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^111vp1sH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal-directed resuscitation for hypotensive shock usually includes administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiation of vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics, their effect on patient-relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was published originally in 2004 and was updated in 2011 and again in 2016.

Objectives

Our objective was to compare the effect of one vasopressor regimen (vasopressor alone, or in combination) versus another vasopressor regimen on mortality in critically ill participants with shock. We further aimed to investigate effects on other patient-relevant outcomes and to assess the influence of bias on the robustness of our effect estimates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015 Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS and PsycINFO (from inception to June 2015). We performed the original search in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries to identify ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors abstracted data independently. They discussed disagreements between them and resolved differences by consulting with a third review author. We used a random-effects model to combine quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 28 RCTs (3497 participants) with 1773 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, given alone or in combination, were studied in 12 different comparisons. All 28 studies reported mortality outcomes; 12 studies reported length of stay. Investigators reported other morbidity outcomes in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life nor on anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 11 studies as having low risk of bias for the primary outcome of mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality criteria. In summary, researchers reported no differences in total mortality in any comparisons of different vasopressors or combinations in any of the pre-defined analyses (evidence quality ranging from high to very low). More arrhythmias were observed in participants treated with dopamine than in those treated with norepinephrine (high-quality evidence). These findings were consistent among the few large studies and among studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of substantial differences in total mortality between several vasopressors. Dopamine increases the risk of arrhythmia compared with norepinephrine and might increase mortality. Otherwise, evidence of any other differences between any of the six vasopressors examined is insufficient. We identified low risk of bias and high-quality evidence for the comparison of norepinephrine versus dopamine and moderate to very low-quality evidence for all other comparisons, mainly because single comparisons occasionally were based on only a few participants. Increasing evidence indicates that the treatment goals most often employed are of limited clinical value. Our findings suggest that major changes in clinical practice are not needed, but that selection of vasopressors could be better individualised and could be based on clinical variables reflecting hypoperfusion.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^111nWeFZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Epinephrine is a potent α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic agent that increases mean arterial pressure by increasing both cardiac index and peripheral vascular tone. The chief concern about the use of epinephrine in septic patients is the potential to decrease regional blood flow, particularly in the splanchnic circulation. On 2003 De Backer and coll. published a trial to compare effects of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine on the splanchnic circulation in septic shock. In patients with severe septic shock, epinephrine administration increased global oxygen delivery and consumption. It caused lower absolute and fractional splanchnic blood flow and lower indocyanine green clearance, validating the adverse effects of therapy with epinephrine alone on the splanchnic circulation.

Epinephrine administration can increase blood pressure in patients who are unresponsive to first-line agents. It increases heart rate, and has the potential to induce tachyarrhythmias, ischemia, and hypoglycemia. Because of its effects on splanchnic circulation and its propensity to increase lactate concentrations, epinephrine has been considered a second-line agent.

A large (330 patients) randomized clinical trial published on 2007 by Annane and coll. compared therapy with norepinephrine plus dobutamine (whenever needed) with epinephrine alone in septic shock. There was no evidence for a difference in efficacy and safety between epinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dobutamine for the management of septic shock.

Vasopressin is a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and is then transported and stored in the pituitary gland. Vasopressin mediates vasoconstriction via V1-receptor activation on vascular smooth muscle and mediates its antidiuretic effect via V2-receptor activation in the renal collecting duct system. In addition, vasopressin, at low plasma concentrations, mediates vasodilation in coronary, cerebral, and pulmonary arterial circulations.

Vasopressin infusion of 0.01 to 0.04 U/min in patients with septic shock increases plasma vasopressin levels to those observed in patients with hypotension from other causes, such as cardiogenic shock. Increased vasopressin levels are associated with a lesser need for other vasopressors. Urinary output may increase, and pulmonary vascular resistance may decrease. Infusions of > 0.04 U/min may lead to adverse, likely vasoconstriction-mediated events.

### Norepinephrine versus phenylephrine infusion for preventing postspinal hypotension during cesarean section for twin pregnancy: a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial [^115bamdY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The infusion rate of NE was determined based on the estimated potency of 11.3 to 13.1:1 for NE: PE, as infusion rate of 40 μg/min for PE is the standard protocol for post-spinal hypotension prophylaxis in our department. In our study, infusion of NE at 3.2 μg/min corresponds to a weight-adjusted infusion rate of 0.044 μg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ (ranging from 0.034 to 0.056 μg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹). In two recently published papers, which were not available when our study was designed, the ED 95 of NE, NE bitartrate to be more specific, for maintaining blood pressure for cesarean delivery after spinal anesthesia was estimated to be 0.07 to 0.08 μg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹. And the incidence of hypotension with NE infusion at the rate of 0.05 μg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ was as high as 30% or even 47.4% in these dose-finding studies. All these data suggested that NE infusion at 3.2 μg/min was too low for post-spinal hypotension prevention. However, these data were both derived from singleton pregnancy and were with wide confidence intervals, so one should be cautious not to directly extrapolate these data to twin pregnancy. Equipotency of both vasopressors need to be confirmed in women with twin pregnancy and maternal/fetal outcomes should be compared with these equipotent regimens in future studies. When comparing NE dosages between different studies, care must be taken to identify which NE preparation was used (i.e. brand name and manufacturer), especially if the NE concentration is expressed as NE base or NE bitartrate, since base is twice as potent as bitartrate formulation (i.e. 5 mcg/ml of NA base = 10 mcg/ml of NA bitartrate.

### Minimising haemodynamic lability during changeover of syringes infusing norepinephrine in adult critical care patients: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1146tpyX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial pressure lability is common during the process of replacing syringes used for norepinephrine infusions in critically ill patients. It is unclear if there is an optimal approach to minimise arterial pressure instability during this procedures. We investigated whether 'double pumping' changeover (DPC) or automated changeover (AC) reduced blood pressure lability in critically ill adults compared with quick syringe changeover (QC).

Methods

Patients requiring a norepinephrine infusion syringe change were randomised in a non-blinded trial undertaken in six ICUs. Randomisation was minimised by norepinephrine flow rate at inclusion and centre. The primary outcome was the frequency of increased/decreased mean arterial pressure (defined by < / > 15 mm Hg from baseline measurements) within 15 min of switching the syringe compared with QC.

Results

Patients (mean age: 64 (range:18–88)) yr were randomly assigned to QC (n = 95), DPC (n = 95), or AC (n = 96). Increased MAP was the commonest consequence of syringe changeovers. MAP variability was most frequent after DPC (89/224 changeovers; 39.7%) compared with 57/223 (25.6%) changeovers after quick syringe switch and 46/181 (25.4%) in patients randomised to receive automated changeover (P = 0.001). Fewer events occurred with QC compared with DPC (P = 0.002). Sensitivity analysis based on mixed models showed that performing several changeovers on a single patient had no impact. Both type of changeover and norepinephrine dose before syringe changeover were independently associated with MAP variations > 15 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Quick changeover of norepinephrine syringes was associated with less blood pressure lability compared with DPC. The prevalence of MAP variations was the same between AC and QC.

### Vasoplegia treatments: the past, the present, and the future [^114aVCgD]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Norepinephrine as a first line-agent

Norepinephrine is a very potent and reliable vasopressor. It increases MAP without any concomitant increase in heart rate. Generally, cardiac index is increased due to both a rise in end-diastolic stroke volume through a mobilization of splanchnic unstressed volume and to a direct effect on cardiac myocytes due to β 1 adrenergic receptor stimulation. Norepinephrine has numerous advantages when compared to other vasopressors, including: a) a very potent vasopressor effect equivalent to epinephrine and phenylephrine and higher than dopamine; b) contrary to epinephrine, norepinephrine does not act on β 2 adrenergic receptors — hence, lactate levels do not increase and may be used to guide resuscitation; c) contrary to dopamine and epinephrine, norepinephrine increases cardiac index without increasing heart rate and thus without excessively increasing myocardial oxygen consumption; d) contrary to phenylephrine, which acts only on α 1 adrenergic receptors, norepinephrine also acts on cardiac β 1 adrenergic receptors and may therefore preserve ventricular–arterial coupling.

Finally, adrenergic vasopressors have potential side effects such as increased oxidative stress, interaction with cellular energy metabolism, and/or modulation of the inflammatory response. As a result, a new concept has emerged called "decatecholaminization", which consists in using non-catecholamine vasopressors in order to decrease catecholamine exposure.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112Epz3c]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — vasopressor evidence in adults: Norepinephrine is an alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist with more potent vasoconstrictor effects than dopamine, resulting in increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) without a significant effect on heart rate, and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a 2000 systematic review showed a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and risk of arrhythmia (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) with use of norepinephrine compared with dopamine.

### Verapamil hci [^1143B6VF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

VERAPAMIL SHOULD BE GIVEN AS A SLOW INTRAVENOUS INJECTION OVER AT LEAST A TWO-MINUTE PERIOD OF TIME. (See Dosage and Administration.)

Hypotension: Intravenous Verapamil often produces a decrease in blood pressure below baseline levels that is usually transient and asymptomatic but may result in dizziness. Systolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure less than 60 mm Hg was seen in 5%-10% of patients in controlled U.S. trials in supraventricular tachycardia and in about 10% of the patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation. The incidence of symptomatic hypotension observed in studies conducted in the U.S. was approximately 1.5%. Three of the five symptomatic patients required pharmacologic treatment (norepinephrine bitartrate IV, metaraminol bitartrate IV, or 10% calcium gluconate IV). All recovered without sequelae.

Extreme bradycardia/asystole: Verapamil affects the AV and SA nodes and rarely may produce second- or third-degree AV block, bradycardia, and, in extreme cases, asystole. This is more likely to occur in patients with a sick sinus syndrome (SA nodal disease), which is more common in older patients. Bradycardia associated with sick sinus syndrome was reported in 0.3% of the patients treated in controlled double-blind trials in the U.S. The total incidence of bradycardia (ventricular rate less than 60 beats/min) was 1.2% in these studies. Asystole in patients other than those with sick sinus syndrome is usually of short duration (few seconds or less), with spontaneous return to AV nodal or normal sinus rhythm. If this does not occur promptly, appropriate treatment should be initiated immediately. (See Adverse Reactions including suggested treatment of adverse reactions.)

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^114vLWoJ]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Terlipressin — HRS1/ACLF dosing, efficacy, predictors, and safety: the starting dose was 1 mg every 4–6 h, gradually increasing up to 12 mg/day depending on response, for a total of up to 14 days; with albumin it reversed HRS1 in 36%–44% of patients, and continuous infusion achieved the same efficacy with a lower total daily dose and fewer side effects. Common ischemic adverse effects are noted and terlipressin is not recommended to patients with known ischemic conditions; clinicians should exercise caution when ordering terlipressin for patients with known cardiac failure or underlying respiratory conditions, especially those with baseline hypoxemia or patients with ACLF-3 and respiratory failure. Predictors of response include a bilirubin of ≤ 10 mg/dL (170 μmol/L), an sCr of ≤ 5 mg/dL (440 μmol/L), and an increase in the MAP of ≥ 5 mm Hg within treatment, with lower grades of ACLF favoring response. None of the studies showed an improvement in overall survival, but for every 1 mg/dL drop in sCr with vasoconstrictor therapy there was a 27% reduction in relative risk of mortality, and in ACLF terlipressin was more effective than norepinephrine in reversing HRS1 and in improving 28-day survival.

### Fetal outcome in the critically ill pregnant woman [^115kHrgo]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Potential effects of critical illness on the fetus

Shock

Shock may occur in the pregnant patient as a result of hemorrhage, sepsis or embolism as well as other causes. Pregnancy results in dramatic changes to the uterine circulation, with a marked increase in blood flow, related to an overall increase in maternal cardiac output and a reduction in resistance of the vascular bed of the uteroplacental circulation. Placental circulation is unique in having no capillary microcirculation but a high flow, low resistance system of spiral arteries. The uteroplacental vascular bed is usually maximally dilated, but has a strong alpha-adrenergic receptor system with a marked decrease in uteroplacental blood flow in response to endogenous or exogenous stimulation. Normal maternal hemodynamic responses to hypotension are therefore not protective of the fetus, but rather protect maternal vital organs, shifting cardiac output from the uterine and placental circulation to the maternal brain and heart. Fetal oxygenation decreases as placental perfusion (and therefore oxygen delivery) decreases.

In the critically ill pregnant patient, several hemodynamic factors may potentially adversely affect the fetus. These include maternal shock (for example, sepsis, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism) or hypotension due to sedative drugs or positive pressure ventilation. Although beneficial in reversing maternal hypotension, the use of sympathomimetic agents may reduce placental perfusion. Alpha-adrenergic agents directly vasoconstrict the uteroplacental vascular bed and beta-adrenergic agents dilate other vascular beds, shunting blood away from the uterus. Clinical data on the use of these agents is limited, although animal studies provide some information. Norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine have all been shown to reduce uterine blood flow. Ephedrine and phenylephrine have been used for maternal hypotension secondary to neuraxial anesthesia, in small bolus doses or by infusion. Phenylephrine is currently the preferred option. Left lateral tilt of the hypotensive pregnant women should always be considered as an early intervention, to reverse a supine hypotensive effect. Our practice with regard to vasopressor use in pregnancy is to follow our usual protocols (that is, most commonly norepinephrine with or without dobutamine) after adequate fluid resuscitation and left lateral positioning. In consultation with the obstetric team electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (see below) may be utilized to identify whether these infusions are producing beneficial or adverse effects on the fetus.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^114F2TWv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 guidelines: Vasopressors (i.e. norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and dopamine) are most safely given through a CVC at a strictly controlled rate, but it is also possible to safely administer them via peripheral vein and intraosseous needle.

Search strategy and MeSH terms.

Searches were performed in PubMed using a combination of the following MeSH and free-text terms through August 15, 2020: "CVC AND resource limited setting", "peripheral venous catheter AND vasopressor infusion", "vasopressor infusion AND resource limited setting", and "CVC AND infection risk AND resource limited setting".

This search yielded 77 studies; nine were clinical trials and/or randomized clinical trials; five were meta-analyses, reviews, and/or systematic reviews; and 18 were from LMICs.

Evidence.

Although this question has not been addressed specifically in COVID-19 patients or for patients in LMICs, extrapolation from other studies can be made. It has been long thought that CVCs were required for infusion of vasopressors in patients with shock due to potential safety concerns of subcutaneous infiltration, skin necrosis, and digital ischemia when infused peripherally.

Several studies have examined the safety of peripheral venous infusion of vasopressors. In a prospective observational study of 55 patients receiving vasopressors through a peripheral catheter at a tertiary referral emergency department in Lebanon, only three developed complications (one thrombophlebitis, one extravasation causing skin pallor, and one extravasation causing non-blanching skin erythema), and all were managed conservatively. Norepinephrine was the most common vasopressor used. Similarly, a single-center study that retrospectively evaluated 202 ICU patients found that extravasation of peripherally infused vasopressors occurred in only eight patients (3.9%), and all were managed conservatively. The median time to the extravasation event was 21 hours (IQR: 12–30). The most common location of the peripheral catheter was the forearm followed by the antecubital fossa. Last, a systematic review of 1,382 patients receiving peripheral infusions of vasopressors in seven studies found extravasation in 3.4% of patients (95% CI: 2.5–4.7%) and no episodes of tissue necrosis or limb ischemia. All extravasation events were managed conservatively or with vasodilatory medications. Among these patients, norepinephrine was the most commonly infused vasopressor, and the median time of infusion was 22 hours.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^113AyqNF]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Pitfalls

NEE has several pitfalls. First, with scarce evidence, the conversion ratio for each vasopressor agent is determined arbitrarily, either comparing the dose needed to achieve a target MAP or estimating the reduction in norepinephrine dose when used in combination. This drawback is especially important given the recent evidence supporting a multimodal vasopressor approach. The calculation ratio in NEE (e.g. 1/100–1/150 for dopamine in some established formulas) is generally defined according to the equipotency of each vasopressor compared to norepinephrine to achieve the same MAP target. As a result, due to the different hemodynamic effects of vasopressors (e.g. vasopressors with inotropic effect or pure vasoconstrictors) and the complex interaction between vascular tone, volume status, and cardiac contractility, similar MAPs may correspond to very different hemodynamic profile despite comparable NEE. On the other hand, NEE allows clinicians to compare the hemodynamic, microcirculatory, or metabolic effects of different vasopressor agents by adjusting the dose of each drug in terms of vasoconstrictive effects.

Second, NEE may sometimes not reflect the total amount of hemodynamic support. Since NEE only considers vasopressor effects, NEE fails to measure the effect of other hemodynamic interventions, such as mechanical circulatory support and drugs with predominantly inotropic profiles. For example, consider a patient with severe low cardiac output syndrome who receives veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane support and moderate to a high dose of inotropes in addition to low-dose norepinephrine. In that case, it will be obvious that the NEE for this patient is disproportionately low compared to the total hemodynamic support. However, it is quite challenging to integrate the intensity of mechanical circulatory support or inotropic agents with vasopressors. In general, MAP is the single measure of efficacy to guide vasopressors, while mechanical circulatory support or inotropes require other parameters (e.g. cardiac index — CI) on top of MAP, where it becomes difficult to ascertain how much a combination of vasopressor and inotrope contributes to MAP or CI. Therefore, NEE should be used and interpreted cautiously in studies, including patients requiring mechanical circulatory support or high-dose inotropes. Although a scoping review proposed a calculation formula based on the available evidence on the equipotency of different vasopressors, the small number of included studies on each vasopressor limits its generalizability.

### Push-dose pressors outside the operating room: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^112pexY7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Push-dose pressors (PDP) were mainly studied in operating room (OR) patients. Critically ill patients outside the OR present with different characteristics and logistical challenges. Available evidence in this population is limited, and the safety risk makes it a controversial therapy.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and risks of using PDP in this population.

Methods

We included studies performed outside the OR, evaluating efficacy, safety and prognostic outcomes, as well as comparing different vasopressor strategies. We searched Pubmed for eligible studies. A random-effects meta-analysis (proportional for single-arm studies), reporting the mean, mean difference or risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was performed. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scale.

Results

Nineteen observational studies evaluating 5034 patients were included. 77.9% (95% CI [71.9–83.4]) of patients corrected hypotension after PDP, with a mean systolic blood pressure increase of 30 mm Hg (95%CI [24.7–35.9]). Adverse effects occurred in 14.4% (95% CI [7.8–22.5]) and serious adverse effects in 1.36% (95% CI [0.16–3.30]). Protocol use was associated with a non-significant tendency for lower risk of adverse effects, that became significant when considering only epinephrine. 69.5% (95% CI [59.3–78.9]) of PDP-treated patients needed a vasopressor infusion. Starting with PDP followed by infusion instead of infusion alone was associated with a non-significant lower survival at discharge (RR: 0.85, 95% CI [0.7–1.02]), that became significant after removing one influential study.

Conclusions

PDP is effective for transient hypotension correction in critical patients outside the OR, with a safety risk that could be reduced with protocol use. Clinical trials are needed to inform current practice.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1168JfHm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion if fluid resuscitation fails optimizing blood flow and if hypotension persists following fluid loading. These agents should be globally available. Vasopressor and inotropic agents have increasingly become a therapeutic cornerstone for the management of sepsis. They have excitatory and inhibitory actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, as well as important metabolic, central nervous system, and presynaptic autonomic nervous system effects. The optimal timing of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion has been debated. Recently, a large multi-center retrospective analysis of 2849 patients with septic shock, investigators found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were delayed by 1 h and infused from hours 1 to 6 following onset of shock. Norepinephrine is now the first-line vasopressor agent used to correct hypotension in the event of septic shock. Norepinephrine is more efficacious than dopamine and may be more effective for reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may cause more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine, and as an alternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine, it should be used only in patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia.

Dobutamine is an inotropic agent used to treat septic shock patients increasing cardiac output, stroke index, and oxygen delivery (DO 2). It has been suggested to be administered to pre-existing vasopressor therapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, defined as elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output. However, dobutamine increases DO 2 to supranormal values and in critically ill patients, it has raised serious questions regarding its safety in the treatment of septic shock. Because dobutamine provides direct stimulation of the β-1 adrenergic receptors, it is recognized as more problematic with regard to tachycardia and arrhythmia.

In LMICs, it may be acceptable to use adrenaline infusions as the inotrope of choice, given it is readily available, cheap, and has been shown to be equivalent to noradrenaline in septic shock.

Increased global availability of vasopressors together with a better understanding of their indications, pharmacodynamics, and important adverse effects are mandatory to fight sepsis worldwide.

### Levosimendan in the light of the results of the recent randomized controlled trials: an expert opinion paper [^112mQwxX]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Potential detrimental effects of classical inotropic drugs

The "classical" inotropic drugs (catecholamines and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors) are widely used in the perioperative setting, particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. While they can provide life-sustaining support in circumstances of severe right and/or left cardiac ventricular failure and improve both clinical symptoms experienced by patients and systemic end-organ perfusion, the benefits of these inotropes on medium- and long-term survival have never been documented. To date, none of the available drugs satisfies all criteria of an ideal inotropic agent (Table 1), and there is no current evidence to recommend the choice of any of them over the others for the daily practice.

Table 1
Theoretical clinical characteristics of an ideal positive inotropic agent (from)

The catecholamines (especially dobutamine) are the most frequently used during the perioperative period. With an elimination half-life of just a few minutes, their on/off properties are quite appreciated at the bedside. The infusion of dobutamine produces a dose-dependent rise in cardiac output, mainly by increasing heart rate rather than stroke volume. Major adverse cardiac events (ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarction), stroke, renal replacement therapy, and all-cause mortality (short- and long-term) increase when these agents are used during the perioperative period. Similarly, the use of catecholamines or phosphodiesterase III inhibitors in patients with acute heart failure is associated with an increase in mortality in the medical setting. The worsening in myocardial energy imbalance likely participates to the detrimental effects of the classical inotropic drugs, especially in situations of myocardial reperfusion injury. However, many physicians still do not perceive the risk of complications associated with these drugs and keep using them routinely, sometimes despite a lack of evidence for their usefulness. It should also be clearly noted that levosimendan has not demonstrated a clear superiority to other inotropes in well-designed trials.

### Adverse events associated with administration of vasopressor medications through a peripheral intravenous catheter: do not confound access route and specific drug complications! [^1164pSu3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Owen et al. recently reported in the Journal a low incidence of adverse events associated with peripheral intravenous vasopressor administration in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

While the authors must be congratulated for their interesting review on this relevant question, we think that their findings require some caution. First, none of the studies from the Owen et al. report indicates the vasopressor concentration used, while it has been reported that peripheral intravenous vasopressor toxicity relies on vasopressor concentration, and that using lowered solutions of a lower concentration helps to improve tolerance, which noticeably increases the safety of peripheral intravenous vasopressor administration. Second, time to exposure directly affects incidence of complications: as stated by Owen et al. among adult studies, the average duration of peripheral intravenous vasopressor administration is 12–24 h, which limits the risk. Third, the intrinsic peripheral venous toxicity is different among vasopressors, related to their respective potency. Fourth, the authors only considered local anatomic events, but excluded potential systemic effects, such as tachyarrhythmia and hypotension. Nonetheless, these life-threatening complications may be due to incidents specifically related to the peripheral intravenous access, like for example, during arm compression for nursing. On the other hand, central venous access per se fully prevents occurrence of such mechanical events. Finally, it should be kept in mind that some complications are inherent to the access route itself: e.g. extravasation after peripheral intravenous catheter versus pneumothorax after sub-clavicular puncture. Conversely, local ischemia, necrosis, and tachyarrhythmia must be considered as complications specifically related to the vasopressor drug by itself, e.g. due to its intrinsic properties.

Beyond these limitations, we fully agree with Owen et al. that the adverse events' incidence and severity after peripheral vasopressors administration are low. Because the rate of adverse events resulting from peripheral vasopressor administration is not different from those from central lines, there is no reason to delay their use, especially for the sicker patients cared for in the prehospital and/or in-hospital setting.

### Early administration of norepinephrine increases cardiac preload and cardiac output in septic patients with life-threatening hypotension [^115hDcwm]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

International recommendations have placed either norepinephrine or dopamine as a first-line vasopressor during septic shock. Norepinephrine is considered more potent and induces fewer adverse effects than dopamine. However, the effects of norepinephrine on cardiac output and heart function of sepsis patients are uncertain. Norepinephrine can increase cardiac output through several mechanisms: (a) improvement of the left ventricular function explained by two effects: direct β 1 -agonist inotropic effect and α-agonist-mediated restoration of diastolic arterial pressure that represents the driving pressure for coronary perfusion of the left heart; (b) increase in cardiac preload secondary to the α-agonist-mediated decrease in systemic venous capacitance. Conversely, norepinephrine could decrease cardiac output owing to an increase in left ventricular afterload. This latter effect is assumed to be significant if the left ventricular function is already impaired or if an excessive mean arterial pressure (MAP) is targeted, or both. Variable results were reported in studies examining the effects of norepinephrine on cardiac output in septic-shock patients. This variability can be ascribed to differences in the underlying cardiac function, or the level of MAP actually achieved, or the degree of prior preload optimization or a combination of these. In most previous studies, the cardiac output was not altered by norepinephrine, but the drug was administered under conditions of a hyperdynamic state, generally after abundant fluid administration. Because of the recent emphasis on urgent and aggressive resuscitation as a key issue in the management of septic shock, current international guidelines recommend to administer a vasopressor early to sustain life and maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. We hypothesized that under such conditions, norepinephrine is capable of increasing cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload. We aimed at checking this hypothesis in an observational study performed in a series of septic-shock patients who early received norepinephrine to maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension. We paid particular attention to patients with prior left ventricular dysfunction and particularly when a high MAP value was achieved.
