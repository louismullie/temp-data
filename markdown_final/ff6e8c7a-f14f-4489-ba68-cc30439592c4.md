## Question

What are the recommended guidelines for transitioning from progestin-only injectables to fertility treatment when the patient is ready to conceive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommended guidelines for transitioning from progestin-only injectables to fertility treatment when the patient is ready to conceive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and expected timeline for return of ovulation after depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Then, I should verify immediate actions at discontinuation, including pregnancy testing and contraception. Next, I will examine preconception counseling and baseline assessments. After that, I need to outline monitoring for ovulation resumption and when to initiate fertility evaluation. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and synthesize a practical timeline with key counseling points, ensuring each assertion is supported by FDA labeling or CDC guidance where applicable [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr] [^114PFVCj].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and expected timeline for return of fertility after depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, because this drives counseling and expectations. The FDA labeling consistently shows a delayed return to ovulation and fertility after stopping DMPA, with a median time to conception of about 10 months and a wide range from 4 to 31 months; importantly, this delay appears unrelated to the duration of prior use, and life-table estimates suggest 68% conceive within 12 months, 83% by 15 months, and 93% by 18 months, which I should emphasize to set realistic timelines [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr]. Wait, let me verify the earliest ovulation data; yes, ovulation has been documented as early as 14 weeks after a single dose, so I should caution that conception could occur earlier than the median but remains unpredictable, reinforcing the need for interim contraception if pregnancy is not desired immediately [^113GKybb].

> I need to ensure immediate actions at discontinuation are clear and safe. The injection should not be renewed when the patient is ready to conceive; I should confirm that no additional DMPA is administered and document the date of the last injection to anchor the timeline for return of fertility discussions and future dating of pregnancy if it occurs [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify pregnancy status before stopping contraception; if there is any chance of recent conception, a pregnancy test is warranted, and if pregnancy is confirmed, DMPA should be discontinued and standard prenatal care initiated, noting that inadvertent exposure in early pregnancy has not been associated with increased birth defects in epidemiologic data, which can reassure patients if exposure occurred before recognition [^115ZoyG9] [^115a867B].

> Next, I should review preconception counseling and baseline assessments, and I need to check that I am not conflating guidance from other hormonal methods with DMPA-specific issues. Initially, I thought to apply the CDC's 2024 SPR advice about switching methods and using backup contraception for 7 days, but wait, that 7-day backup rule pertains to switching from one hormonal contraceptive to another, not to discontinuation for conception; I should correct that and instead focus on DMPA-specific counseling about delayed return of ovulation, the possibility of early ovulation, and the lack of teratogenic signal with inadvertent exposure, while arranging routine preconception care such as folic acid, STI screening, and updating vaccinations per CDC guidance, even though the 2024 SPR does not directly address DMPA cessation-to-conception pathways [^116uCGL2] [^115a867B] [^115ZoyG9].

> I will now examine how to monitor for the return of ovulation, and I should double-check that I am not overpromising predictability. Because menses may be delayed or absent for months after DMPA, I should not rely on bleeding patterns to infer ovulation; instead, I should counsel on basal body temperature tracking, cervical mucus changes, and home ovulation predictor kits, while explaining that ovulation can precede the first menses and that cycles may be irregular initially, which affects timing of intercourse and the interpretation of tests [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether any FDA labeling provides a monitoring protocol; no, the labels focus on delayed return of fertility without a specific monitoring algorithm, so shared decision-making and patient education on early ovulation potential are key [^notfound].

> Now, I should define when to initiate a formal fertility evaluation, and I need to ensure I align with evidence-based timelines. Given the labeled data, a reasonable approach is to reassess at 12 months post-injection if no pregnancy has occurred, recognizing that 68% are expected to conceive by this point; earlier evaluation may be appropriate based on age, cycle history, or other risk factors, and I should document the ongoing use of ovulation tracking and unprotected intercourse during the fertile window to avoid premature labeling of infertility [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying a strict 12-month rule; individualized assessment is appropriate, but 12 months serves as a practical checkpoint consistent with the life-table estimates [^115a867B].

> Let me consider special scenarios and ensure counseling is tailored. If the patient is older than 35, I should consider earlier evaluation given age-related fecundity decline, and if cycles remain amenorrheic beyond 18 months, I should reassess for other causes of ovulatory dysfunction even though DMPA-related delay can extend that long in some users; throughout, I should confirm that the patient understands the wide variability in return of ovulation and the possibility of earlier-than-expected conception, which influences interim contraceptive decisions if pregnancy is not desired immediately [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr]. I should also remind myself to screen for and treat modifiable preconception factors per CDC guidance, even though the SPR does not provide a DMPA-specific cessation protocol, to optimize chances of conception once ovulation resumes [^notfound].

> Synthesizing a practical timeline, I should confirm the sequence and anchor dates clearly. Immediately, stop further injections and document the last injection date; perform a pregnancy test if there is any chance of recent conception; provide preconception counseling and arrange baseline care; and if pregnancy is not desired right away, use a nonhormonal method until cycles normalize, recognizing ovulation can precede menses. Over the next 3 to 6 months, track ovulation with BBT, cervical mucus, and OPKs while having regular unprotected intercourse during the fertile window; counsel that ovulation may occur as early as 14 weeks but is unpredictable. By 6 to 12 months, most will have resumed ovulation, though some will still be trying; at 12 months, if no pregnancy, initiate fertility evaluation, escalating sooner if age or risk factors warrant, with the understanding that 83% conceive by 15 months and 93% by 18 months, which helps frame expectations and timing of interventions [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr] [^113GKybb].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points and safety messages to close the loop. Patients should be counseled that return of fertility after DMPA is delayed but expected, with a median of 10 months and a wide range, and that earlier ovulation is possible, so conception may occur before the first period; there is no evidence of increased birth defects with inadvertent early pregnancy exposure to DMPA, which can reassure patients if pregnancy is discovered soon after discontinuation; and throughout the transition, shared decision-making and routine preconception care should be emphasized to optimize outcomes once ovulation returns [^115a867B] [^115Bp1Nr] [^115ZoyG9].

---

When transitioning from progestin-only injectables to fertility treatment, **stop injections immediately** and allow ovulation to return naturally, which may take 6–12 months [^115Bp1Nr] [^113GKybb]. Begin **preconception care** (folic acid, lifestyle counseling, and screening) now, and start fertility evaluation after 6–12 months if pregnancy has not occurred. If age is ≥ 35 or there is a known infertility risk, **do not delay evaluation** — begin sooner. There is no need to wait for a menstrual period before starting fertility treatment; ovulation can precede menses, and treatment can begin once ovulation is confirmed or induced.

---

## Timing of discontinuation and return of fertility

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop progestin-only injectables (e.g. Depo-Provera) immediately when the patient is ready to conceive.

- **Delayed return of fertility**: Ovulation and fertility typically return after a median of 10 months (range 4–31 months) following the last injection [^115Bp1Nr] [^115a867B].

- **Unrelated to duration**: The delay in return of fertility is not related to the duration of use [^115Bp1Nr].

- **Early ovulation**: Although rare, ovulation can occur as early as 14 weeks after the last injection [^113GKybb].

---

## Preconception counseling and care

- **Folic acid supplementation**: Initiate folic acid supplementation (400–800 mcg daily) to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.

- **Lifestyle counseling**: Provide counseling on smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, weight management, and healthy diet.

- **Screening**: Conduct screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chronic diseases, and genetic disorders as indicated.

- **Vaccination**: Update vaccinations, including rubella, as appropriate.

---

## Monitoring and evaluation

- **Regular follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the return of menstrual cycles and ovulation.

- **Ovulation tracking**: Use ovulation predictor kits, basal body temperature charting, or ultrasound monitoring to detect ovulation.

- **Hormonal assessment**: Evaluate hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone) to assess ovarian function and ovulation.

---

## Initiation of fertility treatment

- **Timing**: Begin fertility treatment (e.g. ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization) once ovulation resumes or after 6–12 months of attempting conception naturally.

- **Individualized approach**: Tailor fertility treatment based on patient age, ovarian reserve, and underlying infertility factors.

- **No need to wait for menstruation**: Ovulation can occur before menstruation returns, so treatment can begin once ovulation is confirmed or induced.

---

## Special considerations

- **Age ≥ 35 years**: Consider earlier initiation of fertility evaluation and treatment due to decreased ovarian reserve and fertility potential.

- **Underlying infertility factors**: If known infertility factors exist (e.g. tubal factor, male factor), do not delay fertility evaluation and treatment.

- **Patient preference**: Respect patient preferences and provide emotional support throughout the transition process.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Nuvaring) [^115n9wtM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Changing From a CHC:

The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, if she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.

Changing From a Progestin-Only Method (progestin-only pill [POP], Implant, or Injection or a Progestin-Releasing Intrauterine System [IUS]):

The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using NuvaRing on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.

Use After Abortion or Miscarriage:

The woman may start using NuvaRing within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If use of NuvaRing is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for "No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle". In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method.

Start NuvaRing no earlier than four weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

Following Childbirth:

The use of NuvaRing may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use NuvaRing but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned.

If a woman begins using NuvaRing postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to initiation of NuvaRing.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (falmina) [^116uCGL2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

After the first cycle of use

The patient begins her next and all subsequent courses of tablets on the day after taking her last white tablet. She should follow the same dosing schedule: 21 days on orange tablets followed by 7 days on white tablets. If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control until she has taken an orange tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.

Switching from another hormonal method of contraception

When the patient is switching from a 21-day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts FALMINA. She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21-day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of FALMINA on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin FALMINA the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start FALMINA on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, implant, or intrauterine system (IUS), the patient should be advised to use additional nonhormonal contraception (such as condoms) until active tablets have been taken for 7 consecutive days of the first pack.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician.

She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.

Use After Abortion or Miscarriage:

The woman may start using Haloette within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If use of Haloette is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for "No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle". In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method.

Start Haloette no earlier than four weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

Following Childbirth:

The use of Haloette may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use Haloette but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned.

If a woman begins using Haloette postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to initiation of Haloette.

Switching From Another Hormonal Method of Contraception

When the patient is switching from a 21 day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21 day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28 day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.

If Spotting or Breakthrough Bleeding Occurs

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician.

Risk of Pregnancy if Tablets are Missed

While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled orange tablets are missed. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is unlikely if Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

The risk of pregnancy increases with each active (orange) tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING below.

### Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate (finzala) [^111cNL9b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of Finzala on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her white Finzala tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last brown tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of Finzala is started later than the day following administration of the last brown tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a white Finzala tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.

For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Finzala no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts on Finzala postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Finzala for 7 consecutive days.

Finzala may be initiated immediately after a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage; if the patient starts Finzala immediately, additional contraceptive measures are not needed.

Switching from another Hormonal Method of Contraception

If the patient is switching from a combination hormonal method such as:

Another pill
Vaginal ring
Patch

Instruct her to take the first white Finzala tablet on the day she would have taken her next COC pill. She should not continue taking the tablets from her previous birth control pack, and should not skip any days between packs. If she does not have a withdrawal bleed, rule out pregnancy before starting Finzala.
If she previously used a vaginal ring or transdermal patch, she should start using Finzala on the day she would have resumed the previous product.

If the patient is switching from a progestin-only method such as a:

Progestin-only pill
Implant
Intrauterine system
Injection

She may switch any day from a progestin-only pill; instruct her to take the first white Finzala tablet on the day she would have taken her next progestin-only pill. She should use a non-hormonal method of contraception for 7 consecutive days.
If switching from an implant or injection, start the first white Finzala tablet on the day her next injection would have been due or on the day of removal of her implant.
If switching from an IUD, depending on the timing of removal, back-up contraception may be needed.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) [^115a867B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.15	Return of Fertility

Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind.

5.16	Sexually Transmitted Diseases

Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

5.17	Pregnancy

Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development.

5.18	Monitoring

A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.

5.19	Interference With Laboratory Tests

The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. [See Drug Interactions (7.2) .]

- Switching contraceptive method to NEXPLANON

Combination hormonal contraceptives:

NEXPLANON should preferably be inserted on the day after the last active tablet of the previous combined oral contraceptive or on the day of removal of the vaginal ring or transdermal patch. At the latest, NEXPLANON should be inserted on the day following the usual tablet-free, ring-free, patch-free or placebo tablet interval of the previous combined hormonal contraceptive.

If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.

Progestin-only contraceptives:

There are several types of progestin-only methods. NEXPLANON should be inserted as follows:

Injectable Contraceptives: Insert NEXPLANON on the day the next injection is due.
Minipill: A woman may switch to NEXPLANON on any day of the month. NEXPLANON should be inserted within 24 hours after taking the last tablet.
Contraceptive implant or intrauterine system (IUS): Insert NEXPLANON on the same day the previous contraceptive implant or IUS is removed.

If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.

- Following abortion or miscarriage

First Trimester: NEXPLANON should be inserted within 5 days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage.
Second Trimester: Insert NEXPLANON between 21 to 28 days following second trimester abortion or miscarriage.

If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.

- Postpartum

Not Breastfeeding: NEXPLANON should be inserted between 21 to 28 days postpartum. If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.
Breastfeeding: NEXPLANON should not be inserted until after the fourth postpartum week. The woman should be advised to use a barrier method until 7 days after insertion. If intercourse has already occurred, pregnancy should be excluded.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-subQ Provera) [^115ZoyG9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, depo-subQ provera 104 should be discontinued during pregnancy.

Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15‑20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving DMPA-IM, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate depo-subQ provera 104 during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted.

The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for depo-subQ provera 104 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from depo-subQ provera 104 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Depo-subQ provera 104 is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of depo-subQ provera 104 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-subQ Provera) [^116Wxxbw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Loss of Bone Mineral Density

Advise the patient that the use of depo-subQ provera 104 decreases BMD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Disorders

Advise the patient that serious arterial and venous thrombotic events have been seen in women treated with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Anaphylaxis

Counsel patients on the importance of seeking urgent medical attention if they experience symptoms of anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Ectopic Pregnancy

Advise patients to tell their healthcare professional right away if they become pregnant or experience severe abdominal pain to exclude a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Bleeding Irregularities

Advise patients at the beginning of treatment that their menstrual cycle may be disrupted, resulting in irregular and unpredictable bleeding or spotting. Explain that bleeding and spotting irregularities usually decrease to the point of amenorrhea as treatment with depo-subQ provera 104 continues, and does not require other therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Delayed Return of Ovulation and Fertility

Advise patients that return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping depo-subQ provera 104 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Risks of Breast Cancer

Counsel patients about the possible increased risk of breast cancer in women who use depo-subQ provera 104 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Depression

Counsel patients about the possible risk of depression and mood disorders. Advise patients with a history of depression or who are receiving treatment for depression to be alert to any mood changes or worsening of their depression. Counsel patients to follow up with their healthcare professional accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Risk of Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes

Advise diabetic patients that some patients receiving progestins may exhibit a decrease in glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Liver Dysfunction

Advise patients to seek medical advice if they experience symptoms of liver problems such as jaundice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

5.7	Weight Gain

Weight gain is a common occurrence in women using depo-subQ provera 104. In three large clinical trials using depo-subQ provera 104, the mean weight gain was 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) in the first year of use. In a small, two-year study comparing depo-subQ provera 104 to DMPA-IM, the mean weight gain observed for women using depo-subQ provera 104 [7.5 lb (3.4 kg)] was similar to the mean weight gain for women using DMPA-IM [7.6 lb (3.5 kg)].

Although there are no data related to weight gain beyond 2 years for depo-subQ provera 104, the data on DMPA-IM may be relevant. In a clinical study, after five years, 41 women using Depo-Provera CI (150 mg) had a mean weight gain of 11.2 lb (5.1 kg), while 114 women using non-hormonal contraception had a mean weight gain of 6.4 lb (2.9 kg).

5.8	Delayed Return of Ovulation or Fertility

Return to ovulation is likely to be delayed after stopping depo-subQ provera 104, as demonstrated in a study of 15 women who received multiple doses of depo-subQ provera 104:

Median time to ovulation was 10 months after the last injection.
Earliest return to ovulation was 6 months after the last injection.
12 women (80%) ovulated within 1 year of the last injection.

However, ovulation has occurred as early as 14 weeks after a single dose of depo-subQ provera 104; therefore, administer the next depo-subQ provera 104 12 to 14 weeks after the last injection.

Return to fertility also is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy. Among 28 women using depo-subQ provera 104 for contraception who stopped treatment to become pregnant, 7 women were lost to follow-up. One woman became pregnant within one year of her last injection and another woman became pregnant 443 days after her last injection. The remaining 19 women had not become pregnant; it is not known if these 19 women were still attempting to become pregnant or if they had started a new contraceptive method.

2.2 How to Take Tri-Linyah

Starting Tri-Linyah after Abortion or Miscarriage

First-trimester

After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Tri-Linyah may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Tri-Linyah is started immediately.
If Tri-Linyah is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Tri-Linyah.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Tri-Linyah, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Tri-Linyah [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Tri-Linyah after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Tri-Linyah following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Tri-Linyah is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Tri-Linyah. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

Compact Blister Dispenser

If the patient starts pill-taking on Sunday, the first active pill should be taken on the first Sunday after the patient's menstrual period begins. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Sunday) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

If the patient will start pill-taking on "Day 1", place a day-label sticker on the compact which starts with the day of the week the patient will take the first pill. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Day 1) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

8. Nursing Mothers

In general, no adverse effects have been found on breastfeeding performance or on the health, growth, or development of the infant. However, isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported. Small amounts of progestins pass into the breast milk of nursing mothers, resulting in detectable steroid levels in infant plasma.

9. Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of norethindrone tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.

10. Fertility Following Discontinuation

The limited available data indicate a rapid return of normal ovulation and fertility following discontinuation of progestin-only oral contraceptives.

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of severe headache with focal neurological symptoms which is recurrent or persistent requires discontinuation of progestin-only contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

### Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (lomedia 24 Fe) [^114GVC5j]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs:

The patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her healthcare provider. Although pregnancy is unlikely if Lomedia 24 Fe is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. Hormonal contraceptives should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills:

See the "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING. Any time the patient misses two or more white tablets, she should also use another method of non-hormonal back-up contraception until she has taken a white tablet daily for seven consecutive days. If the patient misses one or more brown tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking the active white tablets again on the proper day. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed white tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. The possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed. Therefore, the risk of pregnancy increases with each active (white) tablet missed.

Use after pregnancy, abortion or miscarriage:

Lomedia 24 Fe should be initiated no earlier than 28 days postpartum in the nonlactating mother due to the increased risk for thromboembolism. When the tablets are administered in the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS concerning thromboembolic disease). The patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet taking. However, if intercourse has already occurred, the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

Lomedia 24 Fe may be initiated after a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage; if the patient starts Lomedia 24 Fe immediately, additional contraceptive measures are not needed.

For additional patient instructions regarding complete dosing instructions, see the "HOW TO TAKE THE PILL" section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING.

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol (twirla) [^115W43i6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Every new TDS should be applied on the same day of the week. This day is known as the "Patch Change Day". For example, if the first TDS is applied on a Sunday, all subsequent TDS should be applied on a Sunday.

There are multiple options for starting the TDS, and the woman should choose the option that is most appropriate (see Table 1):

Use after an abortion or miscarriage:

TWIRLA may be started immediately for contraception within the first 5 days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage without additional back-up contraception. If more than 5 days have elapsed from the first trimester abortion or miscarriage, then the woman should be advised to use non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide, or diaphragm and spermicide) and follow instructions for starting TWIRLA for the first time. Ovulation may occur within 10 days of an abortion or miscarriage.

TWIRLA should not be started earlier than 4 weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage due to the increased risk of thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Use of TWIRLA after childbirth:

For women who elect not to breastfeed, do not start TWIRLA sooner than 4 weeks after childbirth given the increased risk for thromboembolism [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

If a woman begins using TWIRLA postpartum and has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and pregnancy. If the woman is not pregnant, instruct her to use non-hormonal back-up contraception (such as condoms and spermicide, or diaphragm and spermicide) for the first 7 days of TDS use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1. Indications

Progestin-only oral contraceptives are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy.

2. Efficacy

If used perfectly, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is 0.3%. However, the typical failure rate is estimated to be closer to 9%, due to late or omitted pills. Table 1 lists the pregnancy rates for users of all major methods of contraception.

Notes:

1Among typical couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason. Estimates of the probability of pregnancy during the first year of typical use for spermicides, withdrawal, fertility awareness-based methods, the diaphragm, the male condom, the oral contraceptive pill, and Depo-Provera are taken from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth corrected for underreporting of abortion; see the text for the derivation of estimates for the other methods.

2Among couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time) and who use it perfectly (both consistently and correctly), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason.

### Progesterone [^116wqeGi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A. General

1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.

2. Fluid Retention

Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation.

3. Dizziness and Drowsiness

Progesterone capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Progesterone capsules should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime.

B. Patient Information

General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts.

Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe progesterone capsules.

C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy:

Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests.
Coagulation tests: increase in prothrombin factors VII, VIII, IX and X.
Pregnanediol determination.
Thyroid function: increase in PBI, and butanol extractable protein bound iodine and decrease in T3 uptake values.

D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, long-term intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen.

Progesterone did not show evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro studies for point mutations or for chromosomal damage. In vivo studies for chromosome damage have yielded positive results in mice at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. Exogenously administered progesterone has been shown to inhibit ovulation in a number of species and it is expected that high doses given for an extended duration would impair fertility until the cessation of treatment.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TRACLEER, monthly during treatment and one month after stopping treatment with TRACLEER. The patient should contact her physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. If the pregnancy test is positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risks to her, the pregnancy, and the fetus.

Contraception

Drug interaction studies show that bosentan reduces serum levels of the estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives. Based on these findings, hormonal contraceptives (including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable contraceptives) may be less effective for preventing pregnancy in patients using TRACLEER and should not be used as a patient's only contraceptive method [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Females of reproductive potential using TRACLEER must use two acceptable methods of contraception during treatment and for 1 month after treatment with TRACLEER. Patients may choose one highly effective form of contraception (intrauterine devices (IUD) or tubal sterilization) or a combination of methods (hormone method with a barrier method or two barrier methods). If a partner's vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention, including emergency contraception, or designate counseling by another healthcare provider trained in contraceptive counseling [see Boxed Warning].

Infertility

Males

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving TRACLEER. Based on these findings and findings in animals, TRACLEER may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether effects on fertility would be reversible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Use with Vaginal Products

Water-based vaginal lubricants have no effect on the vaginal system; however, oil-based (including silicone-based) vaginal lubricants will alter the vaginal system and/or exposure to EE and SA and should not be used [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Need for Additional Contraception

Use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when:

Enzyme inducers are used with CHCs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

ANNOVERA has been out for more than 2 hours cumulative during the 21 days of continuous use or the vaginal system-free interval exceeds 7 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Postpartum females who have not yet had a period should use an additional method of contraception until ANNOVERA has been in place for 7 consecutive days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Lactation

ANNOVERA may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established. Females who are breastfeeding should not use ANNOVERA until after weaning [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Amenorrhea and Possible Symptoms of Pregnancy

Amenorrhea may occur. Consider pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea and rule out pregnancy if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Fertility Following Discontinuation of ANNOVERA

Resumption of fertility after discontinuation of ANNOVERA is expected. All women followed for return of fertility experienced a return of fertility by 6 months after discontinuing ANNOVERA [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Methotrexate sodium (methotrexate) [^117PMdg3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12	Folic Acid Supplementation

Neoplastic Diseases

Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Avoid use of products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless clinically indicated [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Non-neoplastic Diseases

Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions. Administer folic acid or folinic acid to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis [see Dosage and Administration (2.10, 2.11, 2.12)].

5.13	Secondary Malignancies

Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate. In some cases, lymphoproliferative disease that occurred during therapy with low-dose methotrexate regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate. If lymphoproliferative disease occurs, discontinue Methotrexate for Injection and institute appropriate treatment if lymphoma does not regress.

5.14	Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Methotrexate can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Institute appropriate treatment for prevention and management of tumor lysis syndrome.

5.15	Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines

Immunization during Methotrexate for Injection treatment may be ineffective. Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines have been reported.

Update immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating Methotrexate for Injection. Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of Methotrexate for Injection should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines for patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

5.16	Infertility

Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility may be reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.17	Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Third Space Accumulation

Methotrexate can exit slowly from third space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma half-life and toxicity. Evacuate significant third-space accumulations prior to Methotrexate for Injection administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.18	Increased Risk of Soft Tissue and Bone Toxicity with Concomitant Radiotherapy

Concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate.

5.19	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Medication Errors

Serious adverse reactions, including death, have occurred due to medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed.

2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.35Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.

Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient needs.

2. Estimates of Mortality From Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral-contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's-but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral-contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.

Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular-disease risks may be increased with oral-contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.

Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral-contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.

### Buprenorphine (Sublocade) [^111GGRe2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Induction in patients not already receiving buprenorphine

Treatment with buprenorphine should be initiated when objective and clear signs of opioid withdrawal are evident in order to minimize the risk of precipitating withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Patients should receive an initial dose (e.g. 4 mg) of transmucosal buprenorphine and be observed for one hour to confirm tolerability before administering the first injection of SUBLOCADE. The recommended starting dose of SUBLOCADE is 300 mg. Monitor patients in a healthcare setting after injection with SUBLOCADE to assess for symptoms of worsening withdrawal or sedation. Patients' symptoms should be stable or improving prior to release from the healthcare setting. On induction day, up to an additional 8 mg of transmucosal buprenorphine could be administered to manage withdrawal symptoms.

The recommended dose for the second injection is 300 mg. The second injection may be administered as early as 1 week and up to 1 month after the initial injection, based on patient need [see Table 1].

Transition of patients already receiving transmucosal buprenorphine

Patients who have been on 8 mg to 24 mg daily of transmucosal buprenorphine may be transitioned directly to the recommended starting dose of 300 mg of SUBLOCADE. The recommended dose for the second injection is 300 mg. The second injection may be administered as early as 1 week and up to 1 month after the initial injection, based on patient need [see Table 1].

Patients established on long-term treatment and whose symptoms are controlled with 8 mg to 18 mg daily of transmucosal buprenorphine may receive 100 mg of SUBLOCADE as their second dose if symptoms remain controlled following the initial dose of 300 mg [see Table 1].

Maintenance dosage

After the first two injections, the recommended maintenance dosage of SUBLOCADE is 100 mg monthly. A monthly maintenance dosage of 300 mg may be considered in patients who tolerate 100 mg of SUBLOCADE monthly, but do not demonstrate a satisfactory clinical response. Maintenance doses should be administered with at least 26 days between injections.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats with subdermal implants releasing 10 and 20 mcg etonogestrel per day, (approximately 0.3 and 0.6 times the systemic steady-state exposure of women using NuvaRing), no drug-related carcinogenic potential was observed.

Mutagenesis

Etonogestrel was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames/Salmonella reverse mutation assay, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.

Impairment of Fertility

A fertility study was conducted with etonogestrel in rats at approximately 600 times the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 mg/kg/day). Treatment did not have any adverse effect on resulting litter parameters after cessation of treatment supporting the return to fertility after suppression with etonogestrel.

Animal Toxicology

Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years), dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach, and variation of retinal blood vessels.

Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses 50 times to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 450 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body-surface-area basis, these doses are 5 times to 25 times maximum recommended dose (MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 times to 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (4 times to 15 times MRHD on a surface-area basis). The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked anemia was seen at all dose levels (8 times to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked leukopenia was noted only at 15 times and 30 times MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon discontinuation of dosing. Bone marrow suppression occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 year study. However, in the 47 week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias may occur with the use of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP or other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. When possible, administration of cardiac glycosides should be deferred until cardiac rhythm returns to normal.

Drug Interactions

See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, Preparation.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term carcinogenicity studies, mutagenicity studies, and fertility studies have not been conducted with Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP.

Pregnancy Category C

Administration of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP to pregnant rats and mice at oral doses 24–30 times the usual daily human dose (based on a 60-kg human) resulted in slightly decreased growth and slight skeletal immaturity of the fetuses. Immaturity was manifested by increased incidence of incomplete or unossified calcanei and phalangeal nuclei of the hind limb and of incompletely ossified sternebrae. At oral doses 60 times the usual daily human dose (based on a 60-kg human), a slightly lower rate of implantation was found in the rat. Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP did not affect embryonic or fetal development in the rabbit at oral doses 20 times the usual daily human dose (based on a 60-kg human). No teratogenic or embryo toxic effects were observed in the rat, mouse, or rabbit studies.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection, USP, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

When administered intravenously, Ertapenem for injection should be infused over a period of 30 minutes. Intramuscular administration of Ertapenem for injection may be used as an alternative to intravenous administration in the treatment of those infections for which intramuscular therapy is appropriate.

2.2 Treatment Regimen

13 years of age and older

The dose of Ertapenem for injection in patients 13 years of age and older is 1 gram (g) given once a day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

3 months to 12 years of age

The dose of Ertapenem for injection in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Table 1 presents treatment guidelines for Ertapenem for injection.

2.3 Prophylactic Regimen in Adults

Table 2 presents prophylaxis guidelines for Ertapenem for injection.

2.4 Patients with Renal Impairment

Ertapenem for injection may be used for the treatment of infections in adult patients with renal impairment. In patients whose creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, no dosage adjustment is necessary. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73 m2) should receive 500 mg daily. A supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended if ertapenem is administered within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis. There are no data in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

2.5 Patients on Hemodialysis

When adult patients on hemodialysis are given the recommended daily dose of 500 mg of Ertapenem for injection within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, a supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended following the hemodialysis session. If Ertapenem for injection is given at least 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, no supplementary dose is needed. There are no data in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. There are no data in pediatric patients on hemodialysis.

When only the serum creatinine is available, the following formula1may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver, at the initial VIVITROL injection and with each subsequent injection. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose after VIVITROL treatment is discontinued, at the end of the VIVITROL dosing interval (i.e., near the end of the month that VIVITROL was administered), or after a dose of VIVITROL is missed, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

2.3 Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued

There are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment. Patients reinitiating treatment with VIVITROL should be opioid-free at the time of dose administration [see Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.4 Switching From Oral Naltrexone

There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from oral naltrexone to VIVITROL.

2.5 Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or Methadone

There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to VIVITROL; however, review of postmarketing case reports have indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

This updated document uses gender-inclusive language throughout. However, when summarizing published evidence that describes study populations by specific genders, the wording of the primary studies has been maintained for accuracy.

Notable updates include 1) updated recommendations for provision of medications for intrauterine device placement, 2) updated recommendations for bleeding irregularities during implant use, 3) new recommendations for testosterone use and risk for pregnancy, and 4) new recommendations for self-administration of injectable contraception. CDC reviewed and affirmed the recommendations for bleeding irregularities with levonorgestrel IUD use and for use of regular contraception after ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception on the basis of updated systematic reviews of the evidence. These recommendations are meant to serve as a source of evidence-based clinical guidance for health care providers and can support the provision of person-centered contraceptive counseling and services in a noncoercive manner.

Substantive modifications from the 2016 U. S. SPR are noted with an asterisk. Provision of Medications for IUD Placement
- Misoprostol is not recommended for routine use for IUD placement. Misoprostol might be useful in selected circumstances.
- Lidocaine for IUD placement might be useful for reducing patient pain.
- If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions. If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
- Explore patient goals, including continued implant use or implant removal. If the patient wants to continue implant use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
- If the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
- If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history:

- º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use; bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. *.
