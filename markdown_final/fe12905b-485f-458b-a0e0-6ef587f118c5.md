## Question

Antibiotic stewardship in pneumonia treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic stewardship in pneumonia treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why stewardship matters in pneumonia. Then, I should verify the core stewardship principles and how they map to CAP, HAP, and VAP. Next, I will examine guideline-concordant empiric therapy and spectrum selection, including AWaRe and de-escalation. After that, I need to review duration strategies, biomarkers, and clinical stability criteria. I will then assess diagnostic stewardship and rapid diagnostics. I should also consider special populations and settings, including pediatrics, COVID-19, and end-of-life care. Finally, I will synthesize implementation strategies, metrics, and a practical decision framework, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored in the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the stewardship imperative. Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and antibiotic exposure is substantial, so stewardship must balance timely, effective therapy with minimizing collateral damage from unnecessary or overly broad agents; I should double-check that stewardship programs consistently improve selection, duration, and outcomes without compromising safety, which is supported by IDSA/SHEA guidance and contemporary reviews [^112sZNAt] [^114oKkZ8] [^114enJWi] [^112sZNAt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to articulate the core stewardship principles and ensure they align with evidence. The pillars include right drug, right dose, right duration, and right route, with explicit attention to spectrum, de-escalation, and the shortest effective course; IDSA/SHEA endorses prospective audit and feedback and preauthorization, and emphasizes reducing therapy to the shortest effective duration, which I should verify is echoed by meta-analytic data on shorter courses in CAP and VAP [^113diwY4] [^116LeSUg] [^114enJWi].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy selection through a stewardship lens. For uncomplicated outpatient CAP, amoxicillin or doxycycline are preferred first-line options when local macrolide resistance exceeds 20%, aligning with AWaRe Access-first principles; I initially thought macrolide monotherapy might still be reasonable broadly, but wait, I should correct that — ATS/IDSA and primary care summaries de-emphasize macrolide monotherapy in high-resistance settings, favoring Access agents to mitigate resistance and C. difficile risk [^115ZzQTE] [^111Zef8a].

> I will now examine inpatient CAP and the tension between timely effective therapy and overuse of broad-spectrum agents. For non-ICU CAP, a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone are guideline-supported options, but stewardship should push toward narrower beta-lactam monotherapy when clinically appropriate and de-escalate promptly; the CAP-PACT stepped-wedge trial showed a multifaceted stewardship bundle safely reduced broad-spectrum days by about 27% without increasing 90-day mortality, reinforcing that narrower therapy can be both safe and effective when implemented thoughtfully [^112sZNAt] [^11421XKj].

> Let me consider HAP/VAP, where empiric therapy often defaults to overly broad combinations. ATS/IDSA recommends empiric coverage for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and other gram-negatives, but I should confirm that stewardship-driven de-escalation at 48–72 hours based on cultures and clinical response is safe; meta-analytic data suggest de-escalation is not associated with increased mortality when appropriately executed, though confounding is common in observational studies, so I need to be cautious in interpretation and emphasize prospective review and feedback in the ICU [^116e7UWk] [^1122rf9u] [^116i3yDx].

> Now, I should review duration strategies and the evidence for shorter courses. IDSA/SHEA explicitly recommends the shortest effective duration, and multiple trials and meta-analyses support 5–7 days for CAP and 7–8 days for VAP, with more antibiotic-free days and fewer recurrences due to MDR organisms with shorter VAP courses; importantly, emerging data suggest that in clinically stable CAP, 3 days may suffice in selected patients, but I should double-check that this is still investigational and not yet standard of care in all settings [^116LeSUg] [^114enJWi] [^111a6ygf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of biomarkers and clinical stability criteria in guiding duration. Procalcitonin algorithms can safely reduce antibiotic exposure in respiratory infections and sepsis without increasing adverse outcomes when embedded in protocols with repeat measurements and clear stop rules; however, I should confirm that in suspected VAP, a validated biomarker alone (e.g. VAPrapid2) failed to change prescribing behavior, underscoring that implementation and clinician trust are critical, and that clinical stability criteria should anchor duration decisions alongside biomarkers [^114MaMYq] [^111V4wbf] [^111sAt2Z].

> Next, I should review diagnostic stewardship because test ordering and interpretation directly shape antibiotic use. I need to ensure we avoid low-yield tests: do not order sputum cultures for nonsevere CAP, do not process poor-quality sputum, and do not test for cure; multiplex panels can expedite pathogen identification and enable earlier de-escalation, but I should confirm they are targeted to the right patients and integrated with clear interpretation support to avoid misattribution of colonization [^116dXq9F] [^113yNdz4] [^114PnHMg].

> Let me think about special populations and settings. In pediatrics, WHO EMLc prioritizes Access agents like amoxicillin, and stewardship interventions consistently increase amoxicillin use and reduce macrolides without harming outcomes; in COVID-19, bacterial coinfection is uncommon, so I should confirm that empiric antibiotics should be limited and stopped promptly when bacterial infection is not supported; in end-of-life pneumonia, comfort-focused care and oral therapy, with shared decision-making, are appropriate to minimize burdensome interventions [^113TXgMX] [^111yzQKL] [^115L1gPn] [^112CZJHj].

> I should double-check implementation strategies that reliably change behavior. Prospective audit and feedback, CPOE decision support with risk-based prompts, and local clinical pathways are high-yield; the INSPIRE trial showed a 28% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum days without safety signals using CPOE prompts, and CAP-PACT demonstrated that education plus audit and feedback safely reduced broad-spectrum use; facility-specific guidelines and leadership support are essential to sustain change [^114oKkZ8] [^112sZNAt] [^1177EUQF].

> Next, I should review metrics to track stewardship impact. Beyond days of therapy, the Antibiotic Spectrum Index captures spectrum intensity and can reveal meaningful shifts toward narrower agents; measuring duration beyond clinical stability normalization is a patient-centered way to quantify excess therapy; and tracking adherence to AWaRe categories operationalizes global stewardship principles at the bedside [^11412j1x] [^111sAt2Z] [^113TXgMX].

> But wait, what if diagnostic uncertainty persists despite best efforts? I need to ensure a practical decision framework: assess severity and risk for MDROs, start guideline-concordant empiric therapy promptly when indicated, obtain appropriate cultures before antibiotics when feasible, reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop if bacterial infection is excluded, and individualize duration to clinical stability rather than fixed courses; this aligns with ATS/IDSA, IDSA/SHEA, and contemporary stewardship guidance [^11421XKj] [^116LeSUg] [^117RP8tV].

> In summary, I should confirm that the highest-yield stewardship moves for pneumonia are: prefer Access agents when appropriate, de-escalate promptly at 48–72 hours, and shorten to the minimum effective duration anchored to clinical stability; embed these choices in CPOE prompts, audit and feedback, and diagnostic stewardship to reduce broad-spectrum exposure by roughly one quarter without compromising safety, as demonstrated in CAP-PACT and INSPIRE, while leveraging PCT and rapid diagnostics where they meaningfully change management [^112sZNAt] [^1177EUQF] [^114MaMYq] [^114PnHMg].

Antibiotic stewardship in pneumonia care focuses on **right-sizing therapy** [^117RP8tV] by matching spectrum to risk, using the shortest effective duration [^116LeSUg], and reassessing at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop when bacterial infection is unlikely [^115BgRBb]. For CAP, use **amoxicillin or doxycycline first-line** when appropriate [^115ZzQTE], avoid fluoroquinolones unless necessary [^113EneV4], and limit therapy to 5 days if clinically stable [^111Zef8a]. In HAP/VAP, apply **local antibiograms** [^1125C4Jy] and rapid diagnostics to narrow therapy and shorten duration to 7–8 days when feasible [^114enJWi] [^116N2cvN]. These strategies reduce resistance, C. difficile, and costs without compromising outcomes [^1177EUQF] [^112sZNAt].

---

## Key stewardship principles in pneumonia management

- **Right-sizing antibiotic therapy**: Match spectrum to patient-specific risk factors and local resistance patterns [^113cnusJ] [^116DwGjs].
- **Shortest effective duration**: Use the minimum effective duration to reduce resistance and adverse events [^116LeSUg] [^114enJWi].
- **Early reassessment**: Review at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or discontinue if bacterial infection is unlikely [^115BgRBb] [^113cnusJ].
- **Diagnostic stewardship**: Use appropriate diagnostics to guide therapy and avoid unnecessary antibiotics [^113yNdz4] [^114PnHMg].

---

## Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

### Empiric antibiotic selection

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin or doxycycline for low-risk outpatients [^115ZzQTE] [^111Zef8a].
- **Comorbidities**: Beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone for higher-risk patients [^113EneV4].
- **Avoid fluoroquinolones**: Use cautiously due to resistance and adverse effects [^113EneV4] [^114NCFtS].

---

### Duration of therapy

For CAP, the **standard duration** is 5 days if the patient is clinically stable, with reassessment at 48–72 hours [^114enJWi] [^111Zef8a]. Shorter courses of 3 days are being studied and may be appropriate in select stable patients [^11324FxU] [^117QokeH].

---

### Diagnostic stewardship

Routine **blood and sputum cultures** are not recommended for non-severe CAP; obtain cultures in severe cases or when drug-resistant organisms are suspected [^111Zef8a]. Use **urinary antigen testing** selectively for Legionella or pneumococcus in severe cases or outbreaks [^111Zef8a].

---

## Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

### Empiric antibiotic selection

Use **local antibiograms** to guide empiric therapy based on local resistance patterns [^113cnusJ]. Start **broad-spectrum therapy** initially, then narrow once cultures and clinical data are available [^113cnusJ]. Incorporate **rapid diagnostics** to enable earlier de-escalation and targeted therapy [^116N2cvN].

---

### Duration of therapy

For HAP/VAP, the **standard duration** is 7–8 days if the patient is clinically stable, with reassessment at 48–72 hours [^112A2qDh] [^115BgRBb]. Shorter courses may be appropriate in select stable patients, but evidence is limited [^111dYGtU] [^116DwGjs].

---

### Diagnostic stewardship

Obtain **lower respiratory tract cultures** before starting antibiotics when feasible [^111Zef8a]. Use **clinical criteria** such as CPIS and biomarkers (e.g. procalcitonin) to guide duration and discontinuation decisions [^114MaMYq] [^111XebwD].

---

## Special considerations

### COVID-19 pneumonia

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **bacterial coinfection** occurred in 3.5% on admission and up to 15% during hospitalization; limit empiric antibiotics and reassess at 48–72 hours [^115L1gPn] [^115BgRBb]. Use **diagnostic testing** — including nasal MRSA PCR — to guide de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics [^115BgRBb].

---

### Pediatric pneumonia

For pediatric pneumonia, **amoxicillin is first-line** for most children with CAP [^113TXgMX]. Avoid **macrolides** unless there is a specific indication, such as pertussis or atypical pathogens [^notfound].

---

## Outcomes of antibiotic stewardship interventions

Multiple studies show that stewardship programs **reduce antibiotic use, resistance, and adverse events** without increasing mortality or treatment failure [^1177EUQF] [^112sZNAt]. Specific outcomes include:

| **Outcome** | **Impact of stewardship interventions** |
|-|-|
| Antibiotic use | - Reduced antibiotic days of therapy <br/> - Narrower spectrum agents [^1177EUQF] [^112sZNAt] |
| Resistance | Reduced emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms [^114enJWi] |
| Adverse events | - Fewer C. difficile infections <br/> - Fewer adverse drug reactions [^111HXjSD] |
| Clinical outcomes | No increase in mortality or treatment failure [^112sZNAt] |

---

## Barriers and facilitators to implementation

Barriers include clinician **resistance to change**, diagnostic uncertainty, and limited resources, whereas **facilitators** include leadership support, education, clinical decision support, and feedback [^114oKkZ8] [^117LKufo] [^1177EUQF] [^111P5b51] [^113FqWSN].

---

Antibiotic stewardship in pneumonia care emphasizes **right-sizing therapy**, the shortest effective duration, and early reassessment to balance effective treatment with minimizing resistance and adverse events [^111qE7Fs].

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP? [^111Z9J6W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics is prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### Antimicrobial stewardship in the management of community-acquired pneumonia [^1163kJUn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antimicrobial stewardship can be applied to the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to optimize management while maintaining or improving the quality of patient outcomes. We discuss such applications, in general, and review the relevant recent literature.

Recent Findings

Clinical pathways or care plans are a means to standardize care for a given disease state and thus improve or optimize the utilization of treatment modalities while at the same time maintaining or improving patient outcomes. Most recent publications describe the application of clinical pathways for the management of CAP in both pediatric and adult populations, reporting success in achieving compliance with national treatment guidelines. As a variation of clinical management pathways, audit tools have also been described that assist in determining the location and length of therapy and proper route of administration of antimicrobial agents with the aim of optimal resource utilization. Emerging rapid diagnostic tools allowing for early identification of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility have great promise for early optimization of therapy for CAP.

Summary

There is a growing body of evidence that antimicrobial stewardship initiatives can be applied successfully and effectively to the management of CAP, benefiting both healthcare systems and patients. Such successful applications will likely grow as new techniques and technologies continue to evolve.

### Principles and practice of antibiotic stewardship in the ICU [^116i3yDx]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

In the face of emerging drug-resistant pathogens and a decrease in the development of new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic stewardship should be practiced in all critical care units. Antibiotic stewardship should be a core competency of all critical care practitioners in conjunction with a formal antibiotic stewardship program (ASP). Prospective audit and feedback, and antibiotic time-outs, are effective components of an ASP in the ICU. As rapid diagnostics are introduced in the ICU, assessment of performance and effect on outcomes will clearly be needed. Disease-specific stewardship for community-acquired pneumonia that relies on clinical pathways may be particularly high-yield. Computerized decision support has the potential to individualize stewardship for specific patients. Finally, infection control and prevention is the cornerstone of every ASP.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116xUUHf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^113iDUuG]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

For physicians treating pneumonia in critically ill patients, the use of the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone is increasingly fraught with uncertainty. Although beta-lactam antibiotics have played an important role in the treatment of pneumonia in the ICU, resistance rates are high; in part, this has been exacerbated by widespread inappropriate prescribing of extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. The current state of resistance across many antibiotic classes is highly concerning, and the increasing difficulty of treating infections has been described as a 'major blooming public health crisis'.

The diligent application of antimicrobial stewardship principles, together with optimized PK/PD dosing strategies, can help preserve efficacy of the beta-lactam antibiotics — at least for the time being. However, to relieve the pressure on the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone in the long term, new approaches are urgently needed; these are likely to include the increased use of biomarkers, rapid diagnostic techniques, and new treatment approaches such as inhaled antibiotics.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^111a6ygf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

'Complete the antibiotic course', a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR. However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental. By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms. This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection. AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma. The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies. In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^114enJWi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — shorter versus longer antibiotic duration across infections summarizes randomized trials and meta-analyses spanning community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with explicit day ranges and selected outcome effects. In CAP meta-analysis, adults and children were treated for 3–7 vs 5–10 days with outcomes including clinical success, relapse, mortality, and adverse events. In VAP meta-analyses of adults, regimens of 7–8 vs 10–15 days assessed antibiotic-free days and recurrence; shorter courses were associated with more antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.26–5.78) and fewer VAP recurrences due to multidrug-resistant organisms (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–.96), but in nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli shorter courses had more recurrences (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16). A VAP randomized trial compared 8 vs 15 days, with shorter duration associated with more antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 3.40 days; 95% CI, 1.43–5.37). Additional examples include neonatal septicemia (2–4 vs 7 [with sterile culture]) and vertebral osteomyelitis (42 vs 84), with the table listing corresponding clinical outcomes; CAP and VAP abbreviations are defined on-page as community-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes great mortality and morbidity and high costs worldwide. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^113HbCQx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the United States. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for pneumonia: the INSPIRE randomized clinical trial [^1177EUQF]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pneumonia is the most common infection requiring hospitalization and is a major reason for overuse of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Despite low risk of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection, clinical uncertainty often drives initial antibiotic selection. Strategies to limit empiric antibiotic overuse for patients with pneumonia are needed.

Objective

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts providing patient- and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for non-critically ill patients admitted with pneumonia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cluster-randomized trial in 59 US community hospitals comparing the effect of a CPOE stewardship bundle (education, feedback, and real-time MDRO risk-based CPOE prompts; n = 29 hospitals) vs routine stewardship (n = 30 hospitals) on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in non-critically ill adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with pneumonia. There was an 18-month baseline period from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, and a 15-month intervention period from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

Intervention

CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period who have low estimated absolute risk (< 10%) of MDRO pneumonia, coupled with feedback and education.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was empiric (first 3 days of hospitalization) extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy and safety outcomes included days to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies.

Results

Among 59 hospitals with 96 451 (51 671 in the baseline period and 44 780 in the intervention period) adult patients admitted with pneumonia, the mean (SD) age of patients was 68.1 (17.0) years, 48.1% were men, and the median (IQR) Elixhauser comorbidity count was 4 (2–6). Compared with routine stewardship, the group using CPOE prompts had a 28.4% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum days of therapy (rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.66–0.78]; P < .001). Safety outcomes of mean days to ICU transfer (6.5 vs 7.1 days) and hospital length of stay (6.8 vs 7.1 days) did not differ significantly between the routine and CPOE intervention groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use was significantly lower among adults admitted with pneumonia to non-ICU settings in hospitals using education, feedback, and CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics for patients at low risk of MDRO infection, compared with routine stewardship practices. Hospital length of stay and days to ICU transfer were unchanged.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^113cnusJ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship

Ideally, antibiotic stewardship in ICUs should include the rapid identification of bacterial etiology, optimization of treatment based on PK/PD characteristics of the antibiotic(s), avoidance of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics, shortening of treatment duration, and reduction in the number of patients receiving antibiotic therapy for non-infectious syndromes. To achieve this, ICUs should continuously collect data and adjust prescribing of beta-lactam backbone antibiotics according to their local resistance patterns. Delayed appropriate therapy is consistently associated with worse outcomes. In contrast, early and appropriate empiric broad-spectrum therapy, followed by de-escalation, is generally associated with improved clinical outcomes for pneumonia. To achieve adequate therapy, it is necessary to select the correct antibiotic(s), an optimal dose, and the correct route of administration (oral, IV, or aerosol) to ensure antibiotic penetration to the site of infection.

Guidelines advise that de-escalation of antibiotics be considered once information is available on the results of lower respiratory tract cultures and the patient's clinical response. A meta-analysis that included three studies in patients with VAP showed that, in some patients, the use of short-course (2- to 3-day) therapy as a de-escalation approach (compared with prolonged-course therapy) was not associated with an increase in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or hospital stay, particularly in those not infected with non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. While the optimal length of antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli remains an unsolved issue, clinicians should strive to stop therapy as soon as possible.

De-escalation of therapy may be guided by scores such as the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 81 patients with a CPIS of less than 6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (at discretion of physician) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy, with re-evaluation at day 3; ciprofloxacin was discontinued if CPIS remained less than 6 at day 3. Mortality, length of ICU stay, and development of resistance did not differ significantly between treatments, actually favoring the ciprofloxacin monotherapy arm.

Biomarkers offer an alternative method to shorten duration of therapy. Several large randomized trials in critically ill patients of antibiotic duration based on falling procalcitonin levels have demonstrated that this approach can safely shorten duration without adverse consequences. HAP/VAP were common types of infection in these studies.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^111nVHbW]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics form the backbone of treatment for Gram-negative pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. However, this beta-lactam antibiotic backbone is increasingly under pressure from emerging resistance across all geographical regions, and health-care professionals in many countries are rapidly running out of effective treatment options. Even in regions that currently have only low levels of resistance, the effects of globalization are likely to increase local pressures on the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone in the near future. Therefore, clinicians are increasingly faced with a difficult balancing act: the need to prescribe adequate and appropriate antibiotic therapy while reducing the emergence of resistance and the overuse of antibiotics. In this review, we explore the burden of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting and the pressure that antibiotic resistance places on current empiric therapy regimens (and the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone) in this patient population. New treatment approaches, such as systemic and inhaled antibiotic alternatives, are on the horizon and are likely to help tackle the rising levels of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. In the meantime, it is imperative that the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone of currently available antibiotics be supported through stringent antibiotic stewardship programs.

### AMS in the ICU: empiric therapy and adherence to guidelines for pneumonia [^1154Bvva]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials by selecting the right drug, dose and duration for the appropriate indication, resulting in maximum benefit and minimising adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance. While AMS interventions may appear to be at odds with practice in the intensive care unit (ICU), they can improve quality of care without compromising patient outcomes. This study assessed if empiric antimicrobial therapy aligned with guideline recommendations for critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

Summary, future directions, and conclusions

This update of a previous narrative review found several interesting new clinical settings in which PCT-guided therapy could help to reduce antibiotic exposure by decreasing either initiation or duration of treatment. Particularly, controlled clinical studies have found that PCT improves the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients, as well as patients with UTIs, postoperative infections, meningitis, and acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e. pneumonia). Recording PCT levels on hospital admission was found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e. bronchitis, AECOPD). For more severe infections (i.e. pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment duration by early cessation of therapy. These strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failure. PCT kinetics have also proved to have prognostic value, correlating with disease severity (i.e. pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e. sepsis). While there is strong evidence regarding antibiotic stewardship in respiratory infection and sepsis, PCT has not been as well studied for other types of infections. Thus, future research should focus on non-respiratory infections and investigate whether PCT improves antibiotic decisions in these patients. PCT should also be compared to other markers, such as CRP, in regard to diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more effective efforts to reduce the unnecessary and prolonged use of antibiotics in self-limiting non-bacterial and resolving diseases. Healthcare professionals share a common goal of achieving symptom relief from infection as fast as possible and often see antibiotics as the best means to achieve this goal. This "one size fits all" approach, however, does not answer the basic questions of who truly benefits from antibiotic therapy and what would be the optimal duration of treatment. There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of PCT as a persuasive, evidence-based approach to a more rational use of antibiotics.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^117LKufo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — necessary elements and impact: Key components to implement a diagnostic stewardship intervention include defining a clear goal; involving relevant stakeholders, including Microbiology, Antimicrobial stewardship and infection control expertise, Information and Technology, Hospital leadership, and end users such as clinicians and nurses; ensuring unit/hospital leadership support; and defining measures to track positive or negative impact of the intervention. The page also concludes that diagnostic stewardship is an emerging method to improve patient care by better implementing common diagnostic tests, that most changes occur in the electronic health record or laboratory and can be scaled to large patient populations, and that comprehensive, expert-led approaches can reduce diagnostic errors and lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment, reduced healthcare costs, and decreased antibiotic resistance.

Diagnostic stewardship — respiratory cultures — Do not order or test for cure, do not order for nonsevere CAP, do not order without clinical evidence of pneumonia (eg, for failure of weaning trials, non-diagnostic bronchoscopies), and do not order for isolated clinical changes (eg, isolated fever, change in secretions, elevated inflammatory marker). For processing, do not process sputum for cultures if > 10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field and use a suction catheter to obtain endotracheal aspirates.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for pneumonia: the INSPIRE randomized clinical trial [^1118CrXf]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study INSPIRE-ASP PNA was published by Shruti K Gohil and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the trial question was: what is the role of computerized provider order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics for non-critically ill patients hospitalized with pneumonia? In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the population was: 44780 patients (23269 female, 21511 male). The inclusion criteria were non-critically ill patients hospitalized with pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years. In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the interventions were: n = 22782 CPOE bundle (computerized provider order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics along with clinician education and feedback) n = 21998 routine stewardship (educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines). In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in extended-spectrum days of therapy (428.5 days vs. 615.2 days; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.78). In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in vancomycin days of therapy (161.4 days vs. 219.1 days; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83) Significant decrease in antipseudomonal days of therapy (240.1 days vs. 360.7 days; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75). In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in length of stay, time to ICU transfer. significant difference in time to antibiotic escalation (6.1 days vs. 5.3 days). In the INSPIRE-ASP PNA study, the conclusion was: in non-critically ill patients hospitalized with pneumonia, CPOE bundle was superior to routine stewardship with respect to a extended-spectrum days of therapy.

### Duration of pneumonia therapy and the role of biomarkers [^113XW62o]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasing antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide phenomenon that is threatening public health. Lower respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity that contribute to antibiotic consumption and thus the emergence of multidrug-resistant microbial strains. The goal of shortening antibiotic regimens' duration in common bacterial infections has been prioritized by antimicrobial stewardship programs as an action against this problem.

Recent Findings

Data coming from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews support the shortening of antimicrobial regimens in community-acquired, hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Short schedules have been proven at least as effective as long ones in terms of antimicrobial-free days and clinical cure. Procalcitonin-based algorithms have been validated as well tolerated and cost-effective tools for the duration of pneumonia therapy reduction.

Summary

Shortening the duration of antibiotic regimens in pneumonia seems a reasonable strategy for reducing selective pressure driving antimicrobial resistance and costs provided that clinical cure is guaranteed. Procalcitonin-based protocols have been proven essentially helpful in this direction. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^117QokeH]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^112CZJHj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

End-of-life antibiotic stewardship in advanced dementia and hospice care emphasizes symptom-focused use, trade-offs, and shared decision-making. For symptom relief in specific infections, treating urinary tract infection may improve dysuria and treating thrush may improve dysphagia, but the impact of antibiotics on respiratory tract infection symptoms is less clear. In advanced dementia with suspected pneumonia, antibiotic treatment via any route was associated with improved survival but less comfort. If prolonging survival is not a primary goal, withholding antibiotic agents should be considered; if treatment is desired, antibiotic agents should be administered orally whenever possible. Patients and their surrogates should be engaged in the decision to use antibiotic agents at end of life, and given treatment burdens, potential for adverse effects such as CDI, and public health risks, antibiotic therapy should be viewed as aggressive care in the end-of-life setting.

As processing, availability of materials, and turnaround time of testing for COVID-19 improved, empiric antibacterial use also decreased, and more than half of patients positive for COVID-19 had antibacterial therapy stopped within 1 day of return of a positive COVID-19 test, although initiation of antibiotics remains high.

### Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19-an evidence based guideline [^115L1gPn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendation for the use of antibacterial therapy in hospitalized adults with a respiratory infection and suspected or proven 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Questions Addressed By The Guideline and Recommendations

We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fluoroquinolone Use

Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are recommended as a first-line option along with β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy for ambulatory patients with CAP and comorbidities and for inpatients. The increased compliance issues regarding the use of two medications may drive clinicians to prescribe FQs, especially in the outpatient setting. The authors mention that adverse reactions to FQs are rare; however, FQ use is among the strongest risk factors for Clostridioides difficile infections, and the list of U.S. Food and Drug Administration black-box warnings associated with FQ use continues to grow.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the distribution of antibiotic-free days in the 7 days following bronchoalveolar lavage. Antibiotic-free days were handled as an integer, with patients classified in one of eight categories (0–7 antibiotic-free days, inclusive).

Predefined secondary outcomes were antibiotic-free days at days 14 and 28, antibiotic days at days 7, 14, and 28, ventilator-free days at 28 days, 28-day mortality and ICU mortality, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at days 3, 7 and 14, duration of critical care (level 2 and level 3 care) and hospital stay, antibiotic-associated infections (Clostridium difficile and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) up to hospital discharge, death, or 56 days, antibiotic-resistant pathogens (resistant to two or more antibiotics) cultured up to hospital discharge, death, or 56 days, and health-care resource use calculated from length of critical care and hospital stay up to discharge, death, or 56 days. When considering outcomes at days 7, 14, and 28, antibiotics refers to all antibiotics given for treatment of infection; prophylactic antibiotics were not considered.

Since adverse clinical events are common in ICUs, the trial protocol mandated reporting of adverse events within 2 h of bronchoscopy. Clinical team members reported any further events after 2 h if they were considered clinically significant or related to the trial.

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^111sAt2Z]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Similarly, clinicians are advised to follow patients' physiologic trajectories after starting antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia. Clinicians should customize treatment durations to patients' clinical trajectories rather than prospectively specifying fixed courses for all patients. At least 3 randomized trials suggest it is safe to stop antibiotic administration after as few as 3 days if patients' clinical signs are normalizing, even if the signs are not yet completely within reference ranges. Integrating serial procalcitonin monitoring may further facilitate this strategy. Our estimate of potential excess antibiotic days is likely conservative because we only counted excess antibiotic days starting 3 days after all clinical signs had returned to the reference ranges, whereas clinical trials evaluating the safety of shorter treatment courses have permitted stopping antibiotic therapy so long as patients were improving even if some of their signs were still abnormal.

Clinical sign monitoring could potentially be the basis for a new antibiotic stewardship measurement. Rather than comparing hospitals on the average duration of antibiotic treatment prescribed for fixed diagnoses (eg, pneumonia), it might make more sense to compare average duration of antibiotic treatment beyond when clinical signs have normalized. The advantage of this approach is that it accounts for differences in clinical trajectories between patients who differ in comorbidities, infecting pathogens, and extent of infection. A measure of this nature would allow for longer courses for patients who are slow to improve and shorter courses for patients who rapidly improve. The key parameter is simply whether antibiotic therapy was continued for more than 2 days beyond when clinical signs normalized.

### Procalcitonin to guide antibiotic decision making [^111HXjSD]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is convincing evidence linking antibiotic-stewardship efforts which include the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) to more rational use of antibiotics with improvements in side-effects and clinical outcomes. This is particularly true in the setting of respiratory infection and sepsis. Yet, some recent trials have shown no benefit of PCT-guided care. Our aim was to discuss the benefits and limitations of using PCT for early infection recognition, severity assessment and therapeutic decisions in individual patients based on most the recent study data.

Recent Findings

Current evidence from randomized trials, and meta-analyses of these trials, indicates that PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship results in a reduction in antibiotic use and antibiotic side-effects, which translates into improved survival of patients with respiratory infections and sepsis. Notably, initial PCT levels have been found to be helpful in defining the risk for bacterial infection in the context of a low pretest probability for bacterial infections (i.e., patients with bronchitis or chronic bastructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). Monitoring of repeated PCT measurements over time has also been found helpful for estimating recovery from bacterial infection and prognosis in higher risk situations (i.e., pneumonia or sepsis) and results in early and safe discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Some trials, however, did not find a strong effect of PCT guidance which may be explained by low protocol adherence, assessment using only a single rather than repeat PCT levels and lower antibiotic exposure in control group patients. Using PCT in the right patient population, with high-sensitivity assays and with adequate training of physicians is important to increase protocol adherence and reduce antibiotic exposure.

Summary

Inclusion of PCT into antibiotic stewardship algorithms has the potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients presenting with respiratory illnesses and sepsis, and holds great promise to mitigate the global bacterial resistance crisis and move from a default position of standardized care to more personalized treatment decisions.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) interventions — pediatric prescribing, optimization metrics, and safety: ASP interventions for CAP have increased the proportion of patients receiving appropriate therapy, and in a pediatric population, a CAP intervention resulted in an increase in empiric ampicillin from 13% to 63% and a decrease in empiric ceftriaxone from 72% to 21%, without an increased risk of treatment failure. Other studies have demonstrated optimization of antibiotic use, including reduced time to oral antibiotic conversion by 1–2 days, decreased duration of therapy from a median of 10 to 7 days with 148 days of antibiotic therapy avoided in the 6-month study period, and improved appropriate narrowing of antibiotic therapy from 19% to 67%, with no difference between the baseline and intervention periods in the proportions readmitted within 30 days (14.5% vs 7.7%; p = 0.22) or who developed CDI (4.8% vs 1.5%; p = 0.28).

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^116UMiSN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our observation that up to a third of antibiotics prescribed for possible pneumonia may be unnecessary suggests 2 potential antibiotic stewardship strategies: decrease initiation of antibiotic therapy for patients with clinical signs within reference ranges and tailor antibiotic courses to patients' clinical trajectories. To decrease unnecessary antibiotic therapy, stewardship programs could encourage clinicians to weigh patients' objective clinical data more heavily before prescribing antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Patients with clinical signs within reference ranges typically do not need immediate antibiotic treatment, regardless of their subjective symptoms. This concept is supported by a growing body of observational and interventional data that affirm the safety and possible benefit of awaiting confirmation of diagnosis before prescribing antibiotic treatment for clinically stable patients with possible but uncertain infections. Analyses of associations between time to antibiotic initiation and mortality in patients with sepsis suggest that delays in antibiotic therapy are associated with higher mortality in patients with septic shock but not those without shock. Quality improvement initiatives in which clinicians empirically prescribed antibiotic therapy only for patients with signs of possible sepsis but waited for confirmatory data before prescribing for those without sepsis suggest that this strategy is not only safe but may even confer a mortality benefit.

When should antibiotics be considered for patients during respiratory viral pandemics and epidemics?

Recommendations

It is important for HCP to identify patients who require empiric antibiotic treatment, despite low rates of coinfection on admission for the COVID-19 and prior respiratory viral pandemics.
If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for CAP for patients presenting from the community with coinfection. Antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infection, are not recommended.
HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza. If influenza is diagnosed, addition of therapy, such oseltamivir, may be indicated.
HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for > 48 hours who are at greater risk for HAIs and MDROs, when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection.

Implementing a structured antibiotic stewardship program

Optimizing in-ICU antimicrobial therapy is difficult. No single measure alone can succeed, emphasizing the need to devise a structured antibiotic stewardship program. Unfortunately, the exact set of key interventions essential to this multifaceted and multidisciplinary 'care bundle' remains unknown, as do the factors contributing to its success. The interventions should be packaged so that compliance is readily assessable and achievable, which usually means that each bundle includes no more than five to eight interventions. Table 1 provides an example of antibiotic stewardship for patients with VAP. Successful implementation requires an interdisciplinary team, educational interventions, system innovations, process indicator evaluation, and feedback to health-care workers. Several studies using quasi-experimental designs confirmed the usefulness of such a strategy to optimize in-ICU antibiotic stewardship, but not all designs proved to be effective. As the results of a recent study showed, simply having a reference checklist, without a robust implementation-and-adherence strategy, is unlikely to improve patient outcomes.

Computerized decision-support programs linked to electronic patient records can facilitate the dissemination of information to physicians for immediate use in therapeutic decision making and improving quality of care. Partially or non-automated protocols, often instigated by hospital-based quality-improvement teams, also had demonstrated efficacy. A prospective intervention of having an infectious disease specialist interact regularly with the medical ICU team was conducted to assess guideline compliance and antibiotic and health-care costs; it achieved significantly reduced use of extended-spectrum penicillins, carbapenems, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Specifically, the intervention group had a significantly lower rate of treatments not corresponding to guidelines, with fewer MV days, shorter stays, and lower in-hospital mortality. Moreover, $89,944 was saved for early antibiotic discontinuation alone.

By highlighting specific areas for improvement and recognising good practices, tailored feedback may have helped clinicians adjust their antibiotic prescribing patterns. This personalised approach is known to be effective in changing behaviour and improving adherence to guidelines.

The use of electronic prompts can also be a significant factor in the observed improvements. These prompts ensured adherence to evidence-based guidelines by providing real-time alerts and reminders at the point of care. This technological intervention likely reduced variability in clinical practice and minimised the risk of human error. It also may have facilitated adherence to antimicrobial stewardship principles, promoting the judicious use of antibiotics and reducing the risk of resistance development.

In the preintervention phase, the empirical antibiotic choices were more diverse, with a higher reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics and polypharmacy. While in the postintervention phase, there was a notable shift towards more targeted antibiotic therapy, reflecting adherence to updated guidelines or antimicrobial stewardship protocols. Our result was concurrent with a multicentric study done by Quirós et al, underscoring the importance of antimicrobial stewardship in reducing polypharmacy. However, the limitation of the study is that the participation was voluntary, the study was restricted to MS-ICU which limits the generalisability. Furthermore, this shift in antibiotic prescription habits suggests that interventions done in our study led to more judicious use of antibiotics, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles. This helps to reduce the development of antibiotic resistance and improve patient outcomes. This change can also minimise adverse drug reactions and lower treatment costs.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia during stewardship efforts and a coronavirus pandemic: an observational study [^11324FxU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The assessment of disease severity has consistently played a key role to antimicrobial therapy approach in CAP. This is also highlighted in Norwegian guideline recommendations. However, our study reveals that documented severity assessment is generally lacking and therefore under-communicated, maybe relying on a more pragmatic definition that CAP patients admitted to the ICU constitute severe cases.

De-escalation strategies are heavily recognized as a part of the global antimicrobial stewardship approach. Transition to narrow-spectrum, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and the timely conversion to oral formulations, were frequently unutilized among included cases in our study. Written documentation of such assessments was uniformly lacking. The optimal de-escalation strategies are to some extent studied in the ICU setting and in mechanical ventilated patients. For non-severe CAP, as for several other non-severe infections, the impact of stewardship measures depends on many human and organizational factors. Despite evidence-based approach to target de-escalations strategies, barriers to guideline adherence exist among physicians. A more efficient strategy to overcome these barriers may be to tailor interventions to human behavioral change.

Therapy duration exceeded guideline recommendations substantially in our study. Comparable findings are previously reported. The rationale for shorter duration (< 6 days) for CAP, regardless of disease severity, proved non-inferior to longer (> 7 days) in a recent meta-analysis comprising 21 trials which included over 4.000 patients. A recent, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial from France showed that 3 days of beta-lactam therapy plus 5 more days of placebo, was non-inferior to 5 more days of amoxicillin-clavulanate, for CAP episodes that met clinical stability criteria. Cure rates at day 15 were 77% and 68%, respectively, and incidences for adverse events were comparable. The implementation of certain clinical stability criteria in CAP, has previously been shown in a large multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized clinical trial to be a safe strategy when assessing therapy duration. The observed therapy duration in our study warrants new approaches to understand reasons for deferring antimicrobial cessation.

Statement scope, limitations, and practice recommendations: The recommendations represent a synthesis by the authors and are not based on a systematic literature review or grading of evidence; the statement concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the global public health crisis of antibiotic resistance by increasing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, which was especially common early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement urges facilities and healthcare professionals (HCP) to prevent harm and facilitate evidence-based care by applying lessons learned during COVID-19 to future viral pandemics, stating this should be done by leveraging the expertise in ASPs to counter inappropriate prescribing practices; during a pandemic, ASPs can lead multidisciplinary teams to compile up-to-date evidence and disseminate care protocols, and ASPs should be supported as a cross-cutting foundation for public health and healthcare system infrastructures.

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^114oKkZ8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute-care settings

The acute-care setting was an early target of VA antibiotic stewardship activities, and studies of several inpatient stewardship interventions have demonstrated tangible improvements in the selection, spectrum, duration, and proper dosing of antibiotic therapy.- Meta-analyses and systemic reviews, including one from the VA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP), have demonstrated that inpatient stewardship activities can safely improve antibiotic-prescribing and reduce antibiotic resistance. - However, limited evidence is available to inform the staffing and information technology resources essential for the success of hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs, including how these resources should vary by facility size and complexity. Contributing to this knowledge gap is a lack of detail on resources needed to implement successful interventions that have been described in the literature. Future implementation studies should quantify not only outcomes but also resources needed for implementation in an objective manner, including time, expertise and informatic resources [Question 10].

In hospitals that lack on-site infectious disease (ID) physicians and ID pharmacists, telehealth is a promising tool for stewardship, and the VA has specific expertise in how to use telehealth for this purpose. Strategies to advance the implementation and sustainment of telehealth-supported stewardship activities in resource-limited, acute-care settings are needed [Question 9].

Future studies, preferably randomized-controlled clinical trials, could further inform several targets for acute-care stewardship activities. First, while oral antibiotic therapy is gaining greater acceptance for infections traditionally treated with parenteral therapy (eg, osteomyelitis), there is room to better define the optimal selection and dosing of oral agents [Question 3]. Second, more data on the comparative safety profiles of commonly prescribed antibiotic regimens would be valuable. A recent pragmatic trial comparing cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam may serve as a viable model for future investigations. The VA Cooperative Studies Program research infrastructure and clinical trials networks have demonstrated success in the conduct of point-of-care and pragmatic clinical trials. - Thus, the VA is an ideal setting for pursuing similar pragmatic trials designed to compare different standard-of-care antibiotic options. Third, large clinical trials could help identify specific situations where it is safe to decrease the length of recommended antibiotic therapy for common uncomplicated infections [Question 4]. For example, in cases of pneumonia, tools such as multiple polymerase chain reaction panels could improve identification of viral pneumonia and, in turn, identify patients in whom early discontinuation or avoidance of antibiotics is feasible.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^113uwZwg]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic overuse contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a threat to public health. Antibiotic stewardship is a practice dedicated to prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and, when antibiotics are considered necessary, promoting use of the appropriate agent(s), dose, duration, and route of therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the unintended consequences of antibiotic use. Because there are differences in common infectious conditions, drug-specific considerations, and the evidence surrounding treatment recommendations (eg, first-line therapy, duration of therapy) between children and adults, this statement provides specific guidance for the pediatric population. This policy statement discusses the rationale for inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs; essential personnel, infrastructure, and activities required; approaches to evaluating their effectiveness; and gaps in knowledge that require further investigation. Key guidance for both inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs are provided.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched Medline between Jan 1, 1996, and April 30, 2019, with the MeSH terms "Pneumonia"; "Pneumonia, bacterial"; "Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated"; "Respiratory Tract Infections"; "Biomarkers"; "Protein Precursors"; and "Anti-bacterial Agents". Although several trials investigated the role of procalcitonin in reducing antibiotic use in lower respiratory tract infections, to our knowledge, few trials have been done in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. A multicentre trial of a procalcitonin-guided intervention to discontinue antibiotics in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia reported a significant improvement in antibiotic-free days at 28 days. However, the duration of antibiotics in both the intervention and the control groups of the trial were longer than the 8-day duration recommended in international guidelines. A further single-centre trial used a combination of the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score and procalcitonin to guide antibiotic discontinuation in patients who had already completed 7 days of antibiotic therapy. Although patients in the procalcitonin group had more antibiotic-free days at 28 days versus the control group, the duration of antibiotics in both groups was longer than 8 days. These studies focused on discontinuation of antibiotics once empirical treatment was established. To our knowledge, there are no published trials in which antibiotic stewardship is based on early exclusion of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^115BgRBb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — diagnostic testing and imaging when starting antibiotics for possible bacterial coinfection: Before initiating antibiotics, HCP should attempt to establish a microbiologic diagnosis; HCP should limit respiratory multiplex PCR tests to ICU patients and patients who require broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy; HCP should restrict repeat microbiologic testing to changes in a patient's clinical status; HCP should perform a nasal MRSA swab for patients started on anti-MRSA treatment; and HCP should not perform routine testing for fungal infection in the absence of a clinical presentation that raises that concern. HCP should review the necessity of antibiotics within 48–72 hours, as results from tests become available, and should de-escalate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on those results and clinical response; de-escalation of antibiotics at 72 hours in the absence of evidence of coinfection, even in the setting of severe sepsis and septic shock, has been well studied and is a safe strategy for the care of patients with viral infections. Procalcitonin results may aid the de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatments, and for HCP planning to treat a patient beyond 5–7 days, studies have suggested PCT as a tool to aid in the discontinuation of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Nasal PCR screening for MRSA allows de-escalation for anti-MRSA therapy and has been shown to have up to 100% negative predictive value, including for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For imaging, HCP should obtain chest radiographs to assess the extent of lung involvement, but daily repeat studies are not indicated, and use of CT of the chest should be reserved for circumstances in which results of the CT may result in a change in clinical management (eg, pulmonary embolus); serial chest radiographs are helpful during disease progression but should not be repeated daily, and chest CT findings are not able to reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of pneumonia.

### Excellence in antibiotic stewardship: a mixed-methods study comparing high-, medium-, and low-performing hospitals [^112XTRMP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

1) Knowledge and Comfort with Antibiotic Stewardship

We found respondent knowledge and comfort making antibiotic stewardship recommendations, particularly among clinical pharmacists, increased as performance improved.

In the knowledge vignettes, antibiotic duration and fluoroquinolone use for de-escalation decreased as performance improved (Table 2, eTable 4). Across sites, respondents chose the correct duration and antibiotic for our "easy" case vignettes (e.g. CAP); however, the harder cases showed more variation by performance. For example, the case of CAP inappropriately treated as healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) provided more variable responses, with lower-performing hospitals more likely to choose excessive antibiotic duration and broader than indicated therapy when de-escalating. One explanation found via document review was that lower performing hospitals were less likely to have locally adapted guidelines or, when they had guidelines, those guidelines were either less likely to include oral antibiotic recommendations or recommended longer (e.g. 7 day) durations. For example, one medium and one low performing hospital still had guidelines referring to "HCAP" despite removal of this term in the 2019 pneumonia guidelines. Notably, the highest performing hospital had some respondents choose a 3-day duration for both CAP cases, likely due to a recent initiative at that hospital to reduce antibiotic duration to 3-days after a new clinical trial demonstrated the safety of 3-day durations for CAP. At lower performing hospitals, we also observed inconsistent answers by ASP leaders (see Table 2, eTable 4).

During interviews, we discovered that while clinical pharmacists at lower performing hospitals had similar time in practice to their counterparts at higher performing facilities, they had less post-graduate and stewardship-specific training. They also reported less access to ID physicians or institution-specific guidelines to answer questions; instead, clinical pharmacists at lower performing hospitals were more likely to report they referred to references outside their system (e.g. regional antibiograms).

In surveys (see Figure 1, eTable 5), we found pharmacists' reported comfort making antibiotic recommendations decreased as hospital performance worsened (p = 0.02). During interviews, clinical pharmacists at high performing hospitals indicated they were comfortable making antibiotic recommendations and tended to describe stewardship as a key component of their job.

Taken together, these findings indicate that knowledge about optimal antibiotic use matters for performance. The level of knowledge key stakeholders had in our study was driven by training; availability, accuracy, and specificity of local guidelines; and access to ID expertise.

### INHALE WP3, a multicentre, open-label, pragmatic randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of rapid, ICU-based, syndromic PCR, versus standard-of-care on antibiotic stewardship and clinical outcomes in hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia [^111KDRCU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias (HAP and VAP) occur in 5–40% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, increasing morbidity and costs. Mortality is estimated at 10–50%, being highest in immunosuppressed patients. Early effective antibiotics improve outcomes, but routine microbiological investigation requires 48–72 h to provide results. Consequently, patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, refined once laboratory data become available. US/European consensus strategies aim to minimise the development of HAP/VAP and to optimise antibiotic therapy; nevertheless, guidelines continue to advocate broad-spectrum antibiotic combinations, hazarding collateral damage and selection of antibiotic resistance.

Numerous bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause HAP and VAP. Culture remains the gold-standard method of investigation despite slow turnaround and failure to identify pathogen(s) in up to 50% of cases. Rapid multiplex PCR tests (also called 'syndromic' panels), seeking pathogen(s) and resistance genes, offer increased speed and sensitivity, potentially improving outcomes and antibiotic stewardship. We and many others have demonstrated the excellent diagnostic performance of these systems in detecting key pathogens and antibiotic resistances. However, evidence of their clinical impact remains scanty, and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence highlights rapid testing in HAP as a research priority.

We conducted a pragmatic multi-centre RCT ('INHALE WP3'), investigating the utility — in respect of clinical outcomes and antibiotic stewardship — of a rapid, in-ICU syndromic PCR test (electronic supplementary table S1) for the microbiological investigation and informed targeted treatment of HAP and VAP.

Antibiotic stewardship recommendation during viral pandemics — limiting empiric antibiotics when viral infection probability is high. HCP should limit initiation of antibiotics – particularly broad-spectrum agents – for patients in acute care settings with high pre-test probability for a viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, even if there is lack of readily available and accurate diagnostics. There is no evidence that routine antibiotics are needed for respiratory viral pandemics in patients who do not exhibit clear signs of bacterial coinfection.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia during stewardship efforts and a coronavirus pandemic: an observational study [^115Dj9YY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent infection of the lower respiratory tract, each year accounting for millions of hospitalizations and significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A majority of cases is caused by well-known respiratory tract pathogens, but microbiological confirmation is somewhat hampered by the lack of sample harvesting, and the sensitivity and specificity of respiratory tract secretions.

Antimicrobial therapy is considered essential for the proper management of CAP. Due to high numbers of cases, frequent misdiagnosed aetiology, and the associated mortality risk, CAP has the potential to propel antimicrobial consumption. For this reason, diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship measures are justified, aiming at the recognition of exposure settings, acquisition, risk factors, severity assessment, and the timely initiation and de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among several respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobials are increasing worldwide. However, in a few countries, AMR still remains at relatively modest levels, as reported from particularly Scandinavian countries. This favorable situation is on the other hand vulnerable to consequences of unjustified broad-spectrum antimicrobial prescriptions.

A national clinical practice guideline for the management of CAP was established in Norway in 2013. Therapy recommendations were largely consistent with those from other European countries, targeting frequently isolated respiratory pathogens. For non-severe CAP, benzyl penicillin was recommended, and for severe CAP, the addition of gentamicin or alternatively cefotaxime in monotherapy. A revision in 2020 left most recommendations unchanged, but added that CAP managed in intensive care settings should receive cefotaxime in combination with ciprofloxacin.

The objective of this study was to investigate antimicrobial therapy for CAP in a low AMR setting at a regional, university teaching hospital over six consecutive years during multiple and continuous antimicrobial stewardship efforts, and the interruption of a coronavirus pandemic.

### Biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPrapid2): a randomised controlled trial and process evaluation [^111V4wbf]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In the VAPrapid2 trial, a validated test with good rule-out characteristics for ventilator-associated pneumonia did not reduce antibiotic use or improve any of our other investigated clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to use biomarkers to exclude ventilator-associated pneumonia to increase confidence in early discontinuation of empirical antibiotics. Previous studies have shown proof of principle for modest antibiotic reduction in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia using discontinuation rules. Serum procalcitonin has been studied widely in the ICU (outside the specific context of ventilator-associated pneumonia) and this approach showed varying success for safely adjusting antibiotic use. However, procalcitonin is ineffective for the exclusion of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which was the focus of our approach. Inconsistent effects of procalcitonin on antibiotic use have also been described for lower respiratory tract infection outside the ICU. Enthusiasm for a procalcitonin strategy in the ICU is offset by high non-compliance with procalcitonin guidance in general, and durations of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in ventilator-associated pneumonia that exceed the widely accepted standard of 8 days. Given that confirmation of ventilator-associated pneumonia is low in cases in which it is suspected, we reasoned that persuasive early evidence for the absence of ventilator-associated pneumonia might have a greater effect on antibiotic duration. Proof of concept for this general strategy had been provided by a single-centre study that used preliminary microbiology culture results to stop antibiotics around 1 day after bronchoalveolar lavage.

### Biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPrapid2): a randomised controlled trial and process evaluation [^113FqWSN]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, VAPrapid2 is the first trial to use a validated biomarker in a cohort of patients with clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia, with an aim to determine whether early exclusion of ventilator-associated pneumonia could improve antibiotic stewardship. Furthermore, our trial included a process evaluation that aimed to understand clinical behaviours and implementation of the trial protocol. This trial showed that, although the biomarker test could accurately exclude ventilator-associated pneumonia, the trial recommendation regarding antibiotic discontinuation was seldom followed by clinicians, resulting in no difference in antibiotic use between the intervention and control groups. The results of this trial highlight entrenched behaviours in antibiotic prescribing practice and barriers to adopting new, unfamiliar technologies.

Implications of all the available evidence

Previous trials of procalcitonin have influenced the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, most patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia do not actually have it, subjecting them to unnecessary antibiotic treatment while the true cause of respiratory compromise potentially goes untreated. Avoiding antibiotic use in such patients remains an important goal for antibiotic stewardship in intensive care units. The VAPrapid2 trial showed no influence on antibiotic prescribing practices in this patient group. Future studies should differentiate suspected from confirmed ventilator-associated pneumonia, aim to reduce antibiotics in patients who do not have confirmed infection, and dissect complex mechanisms that influence prescribing practices.

### Evaluation of rational prescribing in paediatrics [^113TXgMX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

In order to facilitate rational prescribing, the WHO has produced numerous guidelines. For example, the WHO guideline on child pneumonia recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment. Alongside the guidelines, the WHO produced their seventh Essential Medicines for Children list (EMLc) in 2019. The EMLc gives specific guidance re-choice of antibiotic in different clinical situations. The antibiotics included in the EMLc are divided into three groups. The first group (access) have activity against a wide range of commonly encountered pathogens. They also have lower resistance potential than other antibiotics. They are recommended as essential first or second choice empirical antibiotics. The second group (watch) have higher resistance potential and are recommended for a limited number of specific infections. Their use needs to be monitored as key targets of stewardship programmes. The third group (reserve) should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Their use needs to be monitored in national and international stewardship programmes. It is to be hoped that this division of the essential antibiotics will minimise irrational use.

Stewardship programmes have been shown to be of benefit in neonatesand children. Quality indicators are useful in evaluating antibiotic use and 10 quality indicators have been proposed for use in hospitalised neonates and paediatric patients. Others have proposed 25 quality indicators to evaluate treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Two simple quality indicators have been used for community infections. One is the proportion of children receiving amoxicillin as the first antibiotic (target 50%) and the other was the proportion of children who received cephalosporins or macrolides (maximum 10%). Both relate to community infections.

It is important to recognise that it is access to healthcare and antibiotics rather than choice of antibiotic, that is the main reason for the higher mortality of infections in low-income and middle-income countries. The production of the EMLc enables researchers to study the availability of the essential medicines. Unfortunately, studies usually show limited availability of these essential medicines in many low-income and middle-income countries. Universal access to healthcare and essential medicines are necessary prerequisites for rational prescribing.

### Evaluating the antibiotic spectrum index in a stewardship-focused clinical trial for childhood pneumonia [^11412j1x]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Application of the ASI as an ordinal construct in a prior stewardship-focused clinical trial demonstrated similar overall results to the trial's primary dichotomous outcome, while also providing a more nuanced, semi-quantitative view of antibiotic use. The ASI is a potentially useful outcome measure for future clinical trials and antibiotic stewardship interventions.

Importantly, the ASI provided evidence of intervention effects that were obscured by the trial's concordance outcome. An example of this, we noted an increased proportion of narrow-spectrum antibiotic use in outpatient encounters compared to no antibiotic use, a difference only revealed after applying the ASI. This is attributed to the construction of our ordinal categories where we opted to include no antibiotics as its own treatment strategy opposed to guideline-concordance. Although guideline-concordant treatment for pneumonia includes no antibiotics as well as narrow spectrum, it does not inherently distinguish the difference between these two strategies.

An advantage of the ASI is its ability to quantify antibiotic exposure by spectrum within a single, ordinal, or continuous measure. For example, among guideline-concordant encounters in the trial, ASI captured important differences in prescribing by ED disposition, illustrating that outpatients most often received narrow-spectrum therapy or no antibiotics while those in the ICU were most often broad spectrum, despite all being considered guideline-concordant. Similarly, comparing ASI between concordant and discordant encounters provided insights not apparent in the concordance outcome. The ASI may be particularly useful, then, for measuring antibiotic use for specific conditions when treatment strategies are expected to vary due to differences across levels of care, institutions, or patient sub-populations.

The ASI appears advantageous when employed to evaluate a specific antibiotic indication in a stewardship context. This score lends itself well specifically to pneumonia because most cases of pneumonia can be safely treated with a beta-lactam (ASI 2) when the etiology is presumed to be bacterial or no antibiotics (ASI 0) when it is presumed to be viral. Only under certain scenarios would broader antibiotics be recommended such as ceftriaxone (ASI 5) or ampicillin-sulbactam (ASI 6). The ASI could be applied to other infectious etiologies with the first line treatment strategy favors narrower spectrum use such as acute otitis media, skin and soft tissue infections, and UTIs.

### Maximizing the impact of antimicrobial stewardship: the role of diagnostics, national and international efforts [^116fo44i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The decline in the development and approval of new antimicrobial agents, especially those with activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, has arisen as one of the major public health threats of the 21st century. Antimicrobial stewardship has emerged as a key available means to attenuate this threat. Because of the immediacy of the crisis imposed by the dearth of new antimicrobial agents, this review aims to seek out innovative mechanisms that could complement existing programmes to maximize their effectiveness.

Recent Findings

Provision of expedited microbiological identification and susceptibility profiles utilizing molecular diagnostic techniques are means that are showing promise in complementing existing stewardship interventions. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin that facilitate clinical decision-making processes in discriminating between noninfectious causes masquerading as sepsis can assist in withholding or earlier discontinuation of antimicrobial agents. Seasonal influenza and polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine have a role to play by preventing secondary bacterial infections. Electronic learning tools are a means of disseminating information rapidly and universally. Coordinated national and international stewardship efforts play an essential role in promotion, engaging the public, and ensuring provision of sufficient resources.

Summary

The safeguarding of antimicrobial agents for future generations is necessary, if we as a public do not wish to face a world without antibiotics. All potentially available resources must be recruited to order to protect antimicrobials. Robust methods of evaluating each of these interventions needs to be included from inception to evaluate which strategies are the most effective.

CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; PRORATA, Use of Procalcitonin to Reduce Patients' Exposure to Antibiotics in Intensive Care Units; UTI, urinary tract infection; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia.

In summary, shortening the treatment duration for ICU patients with infections is possible and not detrimental for most of them. Indeed, the diversity of patients enrolled in those trials and the consistency of the findings suggest that the conclusions may be applicable to most critically ill patients who develop infections, including severe sepsis or septic shock, with the possible exception of those who are immunosuppressed, those who are infected with multiresistant microorganisms or whose course deteriorates despite treatment, or those whose initial regimen was inappropriate for the responsible pathogens. That strategy should help contain health-care costs and limit in-ICU emergence of bacterial resistance.

### Antibiotic de-escalation for bloodstream infections and pneumonia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122rf9u]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic de-escalation is an appealing strategy in antibiotic stewardship programmes. We aimed to assess its safety and effects using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing adults with bacteraemia, microbiologically documented pneumonia or severe sepsis, comparing between antibiotic de-escalation and no de-escalation. De-escalation was defined as changing an initially covering antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen based on antibiotic susceptibility testing results within 96 hours. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A search of published articles and conference proceedings was last updated in September 2015. Crude and adjusted ORs with 95% CI were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Sixteen observational studies and three RCTs were included. Risk of bias related to confounding was high in the observational studies. De-escalation was associated with fewer deaths in the unadjusted analysis (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39–0.73), 19 studies, moderate heterogeneity. In the adjusted analysis there was no significant difference in mortality (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59–1.16), 11 studies, moderate heterogeneity and the RCTs showed non-significant increased mortality with de-escalation (OR 1.73, 95% 0.97–3.06), three trials, no heterogeneity. There was a significant unadjusted association between de-escalation and survival in bacteraemia/severe sepsis (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.67) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26–0.95), but not with other pneumonia (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45–2.12). Only two studies reported on the emergence of resistance with inconsistent findings. Observational studies suggest lower mortality with antibiotic susceptibility testing-based de-escalation for bacteraemia, severe sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia that was not demonstrated in RCTs.

### Narrow-spectrum antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in Dutch adults (CAP-PACT): a cross-sectional, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, antimicrobial stewardship intervention trial [^112sZNAt]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

Adults hospitalised to a non-intensive care unit (ICU) ward with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia are frequently treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite Dutch guidelines recommending narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Therefore, we investigated whether an antibiotic stewardship intervention would reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia without compromising their safety.

Methods

In this cross-sectional, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial (CAP-PACT) done in 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, we enrolled immunocompetent adults (≥ 18 years) who were admitted to a non-ICU ward and had a working diagnosis of moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia. All participating hospitals started in a control period and every 3 months a block of two hospitals transitioned from the control to the intervention period, with all hospitals eventually ending in the intervention period. The unit of randomisation was the hospital (cluster), and electronic randomisation (by an independent data manager) decided the sequence (the time of intervention) by which hospitals would cross over from the control period to the intervention period. Blinding was not possible. The antimicrobial stewardship intervention was a bundle targeting health-care providers and comprised education, engaging opinion leaders, and prospective audit and feedback of antibiotic use. The co-primary outcomes were broad-spectrum days of therapy per patient, tested by superiority, and 90-day all-cause mortality, tested by non-inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of 3%, and were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all patients who were enrolled in the control and intervention periods. This trial was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02604628.

Findings

Between Nov 1, 2015, and Nov 1, 2017, 5683 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 4084 (2235 in the control period and 1849 in the intervention period) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The adjusted mean broad-spectrum days of therapy per patient were reduced from 6.5 days in the control period to 4.8 days in the intervention period, yielding an absolute reduction of -1.7 days (95% CI -2.4 to -1.1) and a relative reduction of 26.6% (95% CI 18.0–35.3). Crude 90-day mortality was 10.9% (242 of 2228 died) in the control period and 10.8% (199 of 1841) in the intervention period, yielding an adjusted absolute risk difference of 0.4% (90% CI -2.7 to 2.4), indicating non-inferiority.

Interpretation

In patients hospitalised with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia, a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention might safely reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

### Diagnostic stewardship and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: lessons learned for prevention of emerging infectious diseases in acute-care settings [^114Uf5Zs]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of stewardship of viral diagnostic tests to aid infection prevention efforts in healthcare facilities. We highlight diagnostic stewardship lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how diagnostic stewardship principles can inform management and mitigation of future emerging pathogens in acute-care settings. Diagnostic stewardship during the COVID-19 pandemic evolved as information regarding transmission (eg, routes, timing, and efficiency of transmission) became available. Diagnostic testing approaches varied depending on the availability of tests and when supplies and resources became available. Diagnostic stewardship lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic include the importance of prioritizing robust infection prevention mitigation controls above universal admission testing and considering preprocedure testing, contact tracing, and surveillance in the healthcare facility in certain scenarios. In the future, optimal diagnostic stewardship approaches should be tailored to specific pathogen virulence, transmissibility, and transmission routes, as well as disease severity, availability of effective treatments and vaccines, and timing of infectiousness relative to symptoms. This document is part of a series of papers developed by the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America on diagnostic stewardship in infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship. 1.

### Pediatric antibiotic stewardship for community-acquired pneumonia: a pre-post intervention study [^111yzQKL]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) on antibiotic prescription in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Antibiotic purchasing data were collected for children aged 3 months to 18 years diagnosed with CAP from November 2016 to April 2017 (pre-intervention period) and from November 2017 to April 2018 (post-intervention period). The intervention was a 1-day seminar for primary care pediatricians on the diagnosis and treatment of CAP in children according to national guidelines. There was a substantial decrease in the use of azithromycin after the intervention. In younger children, there was a 42% decrease, alongside an increased use of amoxicillin (P < .001). In older children, there was a smaller, non-statistically significant decrease in the use of azithromycin (P = 0.45). Our data demonstrate that the implementation of an ASP was associated with a reduction in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and macrolides and increased guideline adherence for the safe treatment of CAP.

### Impact of syndromic molecular diagnostics on antimicrobial adequacy and time to therapy in critically ill patients with pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116N2cvN]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients and is a common reason for ICU admission and antimicrobial initiation worldwide. Accurate and timely identification of the etiologic pathogen is essential to guide early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, minimize unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, and improve clinical outcomes. However, conventional microbiological cultures often have low sensitivity, are affected by prior antibiotic administration, and can require 48–72 h to yield actionable results.

In recent years, molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, have been introduced into clinical practice to address these limitations. These platforms allow for the rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens directly from respiratory specimens, with results typically available within hours. Several syndromic panels also incorporate resistance gene detection, potentially enabling earlier antimicrobial tailoring and stewardship interventions.

Although the theoretical advantages of syndromic PCR are considerable, the clinical impact of these diagnostic tests in ICU patients with pneumonia remains uncertain. While some studies report improved pathogen detection, more frequent and earlier antibiotic de-escalation, and reduced antibiotic duration, others fail to show consistent benefits in terms of mortality or stewardship endpoints. Notably, the time to effective antibiotic administration is an actionable metric in critical care, as delays in initiating appropriate therapy are strongly associated with worse outcomes, including prolonged organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Syndromic PCR may help shorten this interval by providing rapid, targeted results, but the extent to which this translates into clinical benefit remains uncertain. Moreover, concerns persist regarding the potential for overdiagnosis, misinterpretation of colonization, and cost-effectiveness.

Given the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the clinical utility of syndromic molecular diagnostics in critically ill patients with pneumonia, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing these platforms with standard microbiological culture. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, selected as the most objective and patient-centered endpoint. Secondary outcomes included the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy and time to effective antibiotic administration, both representing key process-of-care measures linked to prognosis in severe infections. This outcome framework was designed to capture not only the potential downstream impact on survival but also the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of syndromic PCR in the acute management of pneumonia in the intensive care setting.

Terminally ill patients — In terminally ill patients, we suggest ASPs provide support to clinical care providers in decisions related to antibiotic treatment (good practice recommendation). The evidence summary defines end of life as the final days or weeks of life in hospice care with goals of symptom control and comfort rather than prolonging survival, and describes that antibiotic use, often with multiple agents, is common in terminal cancer with therapy often continued after transition to comfort care and discontinued less than 1 day prior to death.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^1131vZKp]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) role in outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics — ASPs are crucial to improving antibiotic use during a pandemic or epidemic and provide education and training throughout the institution; during a pandemic, the institution should allocate appropriate resources to make sure that these routine activities can be ramped up to meet the needs of the hospital, provide support for frontline HCP, and improve the care of patients. ASPs actively monitor patients, identify syndrome patterns with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and tailor appropriate antibiotic therapy based on data, and they work with clinicians to conduct ongoing review of the appropriateness of antibiotics while weighing potential harms such as C. difficile infection and promotion of antibiotic resistance. By supporting clinicians, ASPs can encourage appropriate practices to offset the tendency to default to antibiotic prescribing for critically ill patients. During a pandemic or epidemic, the ASP can track emerging information relevant to antimicrobial prescribing, including the risk of bacterial or fungal coinfection as a result of a respiratory viral infection or its treatments (eg, dexamethasone, IL-6 inhibitors) and revise clinical recommendations; the ASP can disseminate and adapt new information as more evidence becomes available; and the ASP also can educate clinicians to limit initiation of antibiotics in the setting of high pre-test probability for a viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, even if there is lack of readily available and accurate diagnostics.

### Pulmonary infections in critical / intensive care-rapid diagnosis and optimizing antimicrobial usage [^114qBohp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of pulmonary infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the critically ill patient remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis with significant attributable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection and, conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of HAP and VAP and the impact of these novel approaches on rational antimicrobial selection and stewardship are the focus of recent studies reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Recent consensus guidelines for diagnosis and management of HAP and VAP are relatively silent on the potential role of novel rapid microbiological techniques and reply heavily on conventional culture strategies of noninvasively obtained (including endotracheal aspirate samples). Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of VOC represent a future approach.

Summary

Further validation of novel diagnostic technology platforms will be required to evaluate their utility for enhancing diagnosis and guiding treatment of pulmonary infections in the critically ill. However, the integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^1168oXJ4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Continued surveillance of antibiotic use is integral to dissuade bacterial resistance. Despite decades of surveillance evaluating quantity, this is the first study to examine outpatient antibiotic prescribing quality for pediatric CAP. Moreover, this study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality by agent, dose and duration. Promoting the use of first-line agents, and shifting to reflect evidence-based short-course treatment are targets for stewardship. Study results highlight the importance of examining the quality of prescriptions across other common indications, to inform and equip stewardship interventions.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^116dQnL5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HCP reasonably may consider empiric antibiotic treatment in instances when a patient has new symptoms (eg, new fever after initial defervescence) and/or changes in lung imaging, signs of production of purulent sputum, dense lobar consolidation on radiograph, or rapid progression to severe COVID-19 requiring intubation and pressor support. Because the bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP often colonize the upper airway and opportunistically infect the lung, it is speculated that these same bacteria should be considered in patients with respiratory virus–related pneumonia including COVID-19 within the first days of hospitalization and guidelines for CAP treatment should be followed. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with influenza, followed mainly by S. aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have identified S. pneumoniae and S. aureus as the main causative agents of community-acquired coinfection at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data on bacterial coinfections in patients who are immunosuppressed are sparse, but there may be scenarios, such as patients with febrile neutropenia, in which empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of COVID-19 or other respiratory viral diagnosis is justified.

It is important that HCP also consider the possibility of coinfection with viruses other than the pandemic strain. The use of nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, mask use, social distancing) significantly disrupted the transmission of non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic such that influenza activity decreased in March 2020 and remained at historic lows. As these nonpharmacologic interventions are relaxed, HCP should anticipate rising circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses to include the possibility of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. In the event of cocirculating influenza and SARS-CoV-2, NIH guidelines suggest HCP initiate empiric oseltamivir pending the exclusion of influenza by nucleic acid detection assay in upper-respiratory-tract specimens for non-intubated patients and in both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens for intubated patients.

Patients who are admitted for > 48 hours are at increased risk for HAI, including those that are multidrug resistant. It is reasonable to consider antibiotic choices that include activity against healthcare-associated pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. Fungal infection, such as bloodstream infection in patients with prolonged central venous catheters, should also be considered if appropriate.

### Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia complicating stroke: recommendations from the pneumonia in stroke consensus (PISCES) group [^113gptdE]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The microbiological aetiology of pneumonia complicating stroke is poorly characterised. In this second Pneumonia in Stroke ConsEnsuS statement, we propose a standardised approach to empirical antibiotic therapy in pneumonia complicating stroke, based on likely microbiological aetiology, to improve antibiotic stewardship.

Methods

Systematic literature searches of multiple databases were undertaken. An evidence review and a round of consensus consultation were completed prior to a final multi-disciplinary consensus meeting in September 2017, held in Barcelona, Spain. Consensus was approached using a modified Delphi technique and defined a priori as 75% agreement between the consensus group members. Findings: No randomised trials to guide antibiotic treatment of pneumonia complicating stroke were identified. Consensus was reached for the following: (1) Stroke-associated pneumonia may be caused by organisms associated with either community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia; (2) Treatment for early stroke-associated pneumonia (< 72 h of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms; (3) Treatment for late stroke-associated pneumonia (≥ 72 h and within seven days of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms plus coliforms ± Pseudomonas spp. if risk factors; (4) No additional antimicrobial cover is required for patients with dysphagia or aspiration; (5) Pneumonia occurring after seven days from stroke onset should be treated as for hospital-acquired pneumonia; (6) Treatment should continue for at least seven days for each of these scenarios.

Discussion

Consensus recommendations for antibiotic treatment of the spectrum of pneumonia complicating stroke are proposed. However, there was limited evidence available to formulate consensus on choice of specific antibiotic class for pneumonia complicating stroke.

Conclusion

Further studies are required to inform evidence-based treatment of stroke-associated pneumonia including randomised trials of antibiotics and validation of candidate biomarkers.

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^112WUXkX]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial, use of the FAP plus PCR test led to faster and more targeted microbial treatment for hospitalized patients with CAP. The findings align with the broader concept of clinical management or treatment stewardship for LRT infections. Routinely deployed rapid syndromic testing could complement or replace targeted components of the standard laboratory-based diagnostic repertoire for patients who are admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory illness. Future studies should examine the effect of comprehensive rapid syndromic testing on clinical outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of this diagnostic tool, and the development of implementation strategies that facilitate the integration of rapid syndromic testing into routine clinical practice.

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^114PnHMg]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are a leading cause of hospital admissions and mortality. Molecular tests have the potential to optimize treatment decisions and management of CAP, but limited evidence exists to support their routine use.

Objective

To determine whether the judicious use of a syndromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based panel for rapid testing of CAP in the emergency department (ED) leads to faster, more accurate microbiological test result-based treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This parallel-arm, single-blinded, single-center, randomized clinical superiority trial was conducted between September 25, 2020, and June 21, 2022, in the ED of Haukeland University Hospital, a large tertiary care hospital in Bergen, Norway. Adult patients who presented to the ED with suspected CAP were recruited. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention arm or standard-of-care arm. The primary outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Intervention

Patients randomized to the intervention arm received rapid syndromic PCR testing (BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia plus Panel; bioMérieux) of LRT samples and standard of care. Patients randomized to the standard-of-care arm received standard microbiological diagnostics alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 2 primary outcomes were the provision of pathogen-directed treatment based on a microbiological test result and the time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment (within 48 hours after randomization).

Results

There were 374 patients (221 males [59.1%]; median (IQR) age, 72 [60–79] years) included in the trial, with 187 in each treatment arm. Analysis of primary outcomes showed that 66 patients (35.3%) in the intervention arm and 25 (13.4%) in the standard-of-care arm received pathogen-directed treatment, corresponding to a reduction in absolute risk of 21.9 (95% CI, 13.5–30.3) percentage points and an odds ratio for the intervention arm of 3.53 (95% CI, 2.13–6.02; P < .001). The median (IQR) time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment within 48 hours was 34.5 (31.6–37.3) hours in the intervention arm and 43.8 (42.0–45.6) hours in the standard-of-care arm (mean difference, -9.4 hours; 95% CI, -12.7 to -6.0 hours; P < .001). The corresponding hazard ratio for intervention compared with standard of care was 3.08 (95% CI, 1.95–4.89). Findings remained significant after adjustment for season.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this randomized clinical trial indicated that routine deployment of PCR testing for LRT pathogens led to faster and more targeted microbial treatment for patients with suspected CAP. Rapid molecular testing could complement or replace selected standard, time-consuming, laboratory-based diagnostics.

### Etiology of bacterial pneumonia and multi-drug resistance pattern among pneumonia suspected patients in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JYbfs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

According to this systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of bacterial pneumonia infection and MDR have alarmingly increased and become a public health threat. The most common etiology identified was K. pneumoniae followed by S. pneumoniae. This indicates an urgent need of routine screening and appropriate treatment for better management of pneumonia suspected patients as well as effective controlling of the emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, it serves as a wake-up call to international, continental, and national health bureaus, as well as other stakeholders, to develop targeted prevention and control strategies, and strengthen antibiotics stewardship programs for better management of hospital-acquired as well as community-acquired infections. Moreover, the data could be used for future complementary research and evidence-based decision-making both in clinical and public health approaches.

### New diagnostic methods for pneumonia in the ICU [^115327qK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia leading to severe sepsis and critical illness including respiratory failure remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection, and conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of community-acquired and health care-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), are the focus of recent studies reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Newer surveillance definitions are sensitive for pneumonia in the ICU including VAP but consistently underdetect patients that are clinically shown to have bacterial VAP based on clinical diagnostic criteria and response to antibiotic treatment. Routinely measured plasma biomarkers, including procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, lack sufficient precision and predictive accuracy to inform diagnosis. Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic-acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of volatile organic compounds, represent a future approach.

Summary

The integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform significantly improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^113dow32]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that use of the FAP plus PCR test for LRT pathogens as part of the diagnostic workup for hospitalized patients with suspected CAP increases the provision of and reduces the time to pathogen-directed treatment compared with comprehensive standard-of-care microbiological testing. The FAP plus PCR test provides ED clinicians with close to real-time information for actionable treatment decisions.

To our knowledge, this trial was the first to examine the effect of a rapid syndromic PCR pneumonia panel applied specifically to patients hospitalized with CAP. Most previous studies did not use a comprehensive syndromic PCR panel or included patients shortly after admission, potentially limiting the advantages of rapid molecular testing. Another aspect of its novelty is the emphasis on pragmatism whereby decisions to continue, switch, or discontinue antimicrobial treatment were at the discretion of the treating physician alone.

The intervention led to a reduction (by 9.4 hours) in the median time without provision of pathogen-directed treatment within the first 48 hours after randomization, compared with standard of care. For patients with CAP, the median turnaround time (from admission to receiving an LRT test result without restriction to 48 hours) was reduced by much more (53.8 hours) for the intervention vs standard-of-care group. This result partly reflects hospital practice and is comparable to previous findings. A faster microbiological diagnosis allows for directed therapy, which has been shown in previous studies to improve outcomes, limit antibiotic overuse, and prevent antimicrobial resistance. Despite crowded conditions at the ED, a FAP plus PCR test result was delivered within 4 hours for patients with CAP, a turnaround time comparable to that achieved in other centers.

No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between the intervention and standard-of-care groups. However, the primary objective of this trial was to enhance diagnostic stewardship by determining and then leveraging the rapid, multipathogen detection capabilities of the FAP plus PCR test.

We sought to reduce the time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment, potentially decreasing unnecessary or broad-spectrum antibiotic use and fostering antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should continue to explore innovative approaches to improving the diagnosis and management of respiratory infections, such as incorporating clinical decision support tools and antimicrobial stewardship programs into routine practice.

### Efficacy and safety of antimicrobial stewardship prospective audit and feedback in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 (COVASP): a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial [^116YH2eH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased antimicrobial use despite low rates of bacterial co-infection. Prospective audit and feedback is recommended to optimise antibiotic prescribing, but high-quality evidence supporting its use for COVID-19 is absent. We aimed to study the efficacy and safety of prospective audit and feedback in patients admitted to hospital for the treatment of COVID-19.

Methods

COVASP was a prospective, pragmatic, non-inferiority, small-unit, cluster-randomised trial comparing prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care with standard of care alone in adults admitted to three hospitals in Edmonton, AB, Canada, with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients aged at least 18 years who were admitted from the community to a designated study bed with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 14 days were included if they had an oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air, required supplemental oxygen, or had chest-imaging findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were excluded if they were transferred in from another acute care centre, enrolled in another clinical trial that involved antibiotic therapy, expected to progress to palliative care or death within 48 h of hospital admission, or managed by any member of the research team within 30 days of enrolment. COVID-19 unit and critical care unit beds were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) to the prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care group or the standard of care group. Patients were masked to their bed assignment but the attending physician and study team were not. The primary outcome was clinical status on postadmission day 15, measured using a seven-point ordinal scale. We used a non-inferiority margin of 0.5. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04896866, and is now closed.

Findings

Between March 1 and Oct 29, 2021, 1411 patients were screened and 886 were enrolled: 457 into the prospective audit and feedback plus standard of care group, of whom 429 completed the study, and 429 into the standard of care group, of whom 404 completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups, with an overall mean age of 56.7 years (SD 17.3) and a median baseline ordinal scale of 4.0 (IQR 4.0–5.0). 301 audit and feedback events were recorded in the intervention group and 215 recommendations were made, of which 181 (84%) were accepted. Despite lower antibiotic use in the intervention group than in the control group (length of therapy 364.9 vs 384.2 days per 1000 patient days), clinical status at postadmission day 15 was non-inferior (median ordinal score 2.0 [IQR 2.0–3.0] vs 2.0 [IQR 2.0–4.0]; p = 0.37, Mann-Whitney U test). Neutropenia was uncommon in both the intervention group (13 [3%] of 420 patients) and the control group (20 [5%] of 396 patients), and acute kidney injury occurred at a similar rate in both groups (74 [18%] of 421 patients in the intervention group and 76 [19%] of 399 patients in the control group). No intervention-related deaths were recorded.

Interpretation

This cluster-randomised clinical trial shows that prospective audit and feedback is safe and effective in optimising and reducing antibiotic use in adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Despite many competing priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic, antimicrobial stewardship should remain a priority to mitigate the overuse of antibiotics in this population.

### Diagnostic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia with syndromic molecular testing: a randomized clinical trial [^114rzx5y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Primary End Points

In the intervention arm, 46 Forty-six of 97 patients (47.4%) with CAP in the intervention arm and 16 of 103 patients (15.5%) with CAP in the standard-of-care arm received pathogen-directed treatment within 48 hours (absolute risk difference, 31.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 19.7–44.0 percentage points; P < .001) (Table 3), corresponding to an OR for the intervention arm of 4.90 (95% CI, 2.57–9.77; P < .001). The median (IQR) time to provision of pathogen-directed treatment was 29.9 (25.9–34.1) hours in the intervention arm and 42.3 (39.5–45.1) hours in the standard-of-care arm (mean difference, −12.3 hours; 95% CI, −17.3 to −7.3 hours; P < .001) and a corresponding HR for intervention arm compared with standard-of-care arm of 3.45 (95% CI, 1.98–6.02).

### Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia: aetiology and management [^116DwGjs]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent articles of clinical and investigational interest on Gram-negative pneumonia, particularly hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, are reviewed.

Recent Findings

The high rate of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia has been repeatedly documented. The predominant pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the other hand, the frequency of Gram-negative bacteria in community-acquired pneumonia and in early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia is increasing. Patients with risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens should initially receive a combination therapy that covers a broad spectrum, and, as soon as the pathogen and the susceptibilities are available, treatment should be simplified to a more targeted one (with the possible exception of P. aeruginosa pneumonia). Adequate dosing is of great importance and the use of pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles when prescribing antibiotics increases effectiveness. The optimal duration of therapy remains unknown; several studies have supported the use of shorter courses of treatment. Alternative treatment approaches (e.g. vaccines) are under investigation.

Summary

The increasing frequency of resistant Gram-negative bacteria and the shortage of newer antibiotics in the pipeline with activity against Gram-negative bacteria is of concern. Early effective antimicrobial treatment is a key for the resolution of infection and improved survival.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: a systematic survey [^116fwK4U]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are two intersecting public health emergencies. With over 6 million cumulative reported deaths and over 700 million reported cases as of September 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed public health and healthcare systems. While recent public health efforts have largely focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on human health, another more insidious pandemic threatens similar societal harm.

Bacterial AMR is directly attributable to an estimated 1.27 million deaths each year, making it one of the leading causes of global mortality. Despite the viral aetiology and low bacterial co-infection rate in COVID-19, the proportion of patients with COVID-19 receiving an antibiotic may be as high as 75%which may further contribute to the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic use during the pandemic was highly heterogeneous across settings, risking exacerbating global disparities in the prevalence of AMR. Antibiotic overuse is common due to initial uncertainty in aetiology while awaiting test results and concerns about possible co-infection even once SARS-CoV-2 is identified. Further, efforts to address COVID-19 have disrupted antimicrobial stewardship programs due to redeployed staffing and competing tasks such as addressing drug shortages, acquiring therapeutic agents, and developing COVID-19 guidelines. A recent systematic review performed by our team indicates that as many as 60% of patients that have bacterial infections and COVID-19 harbour an antibiotic resistant organismand data evaluating AMR during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19 have shown an increase in AMR in a number of microorganism species.

Clinical practice guidelines are a key antimicrobial stewardship strategy and play an important role in supporting appropriate antibiotic prescribing, yet wide variability in practice patterns persist. Guideline recommendation quality, consistency, and incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship principles may help support more optimal prescribing. We aimed to assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing guidelines and recommendations in the context of COVID-19, and whether these guidelines incorporate principles of antimicrobial stewardship.

### Quality improvement methods increase appropriate antibiotic prescribing for childhood pneumonia [^115hBimu]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In August 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and Infectious Disease Society of America published an evidence-based guideline for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children ≥ 3 months. Our objective was to evaluate if quality improvement (QI) methods could improve appropriate antibiotic prescribing in a setting without a formal antimicrobial stewardship program.

Methods

At a tertiary children's hospital, QI methods were used to rapidly implement the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society/Infectious Disease Society of America guideline recommendations for appropriate first-line antibiotic therapy in children with CAP. QI interventions focused on 4 key drivers and were tested separately in the emergency department and on the hospital medicine resident teams, using multiple plan-do-study-act cycles. Medical records of eligible patients were reviewed weekly to determine the success of prescribing recommended antibiotic therapy. The impact of these interventions on our outcome was tracked over time on run charts.

Results

Appropriate first-line antibiotic prescribing for children admitted with the diagnosis of CAP increased in the emergency department from a median baseline of 0% to 100% and on the hospital medicine resident teams from 30% to 100% within 6 months of introducing the guidelines locally at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and has been sustained for 3 months.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that QI methods can rapidly improve adherence to national guidelines even in settings without a formal antimicrobial stewardship program to encourage judicious antibiotic prescribing for CAP.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^115dvMVh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — alternative dosing strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles for hospitalized patients on broad-spectrum β-lactams and vancomycin are addressed as follows: "In hospitalized patients, we suggest ASPs advocate for the use of alternative dosing strategies vs standard dosing for broad-spectrum β-lactams to decrease costs (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)", and "Considering the limited evidence, we cannot give any recommendation about the utility of alternative dosing strategies for vancomycin". For β-lactams, "one meta-analysis showed decreased mortality (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, .41–.83) among patients receiving continuous infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam vs standard infusions", though "This meta-analysis included 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that comprised only 25% of the patient outcomes analyzed". In contrast, "another meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs did not support improved outcomes" and "A Cochrane review [104] and a recent randomized trial [105] in critically ill patients of continuous infusions of β-lactam antibiotics compared with standard intermittent dosing also did not demonstrate benefits in outcome". For vancomycin, "continuous infusion has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults but has been associated with decreased nephrotoxicity in a meta-analysis", and in children continuous infusion "has been associated with fewer adverse effects and no nephrotoxicity". Cost data indicate that "Alternative dosing strategies for β-lactam antibiotics [108] and vancomycin [109] were associated with significantly lower costs than intermittent infusions in randomized studies".

### Core elements of antibiotic stewardship… [^117RP8tV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to measure and improve how antibiotics are prescribed by clinicians and used by patients.
- CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship offer providers and facilities a set of key principles to guide efforts to improve antibiotic use and, therefore, advance patient safety and improve outcomes. Overview Improving antibiotic prescribing practices and use is critical to effectively treat infections, protect patients from harms caused by unnecessary antibiotic use, and combat antimicrobial resistance. The Core Elements frameworks complement existing guidelines and standards from key healthcare partner organizations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, and The Joint Commission.

CDC recognizes that there is no "one size fits all" approach to optimize antibiotic use for all healthcare settings. The complexity of medical decision-making surrounding antibiotic use and the variability in facility size and types of care in U. S. healthcare settings require flexible programs and activities.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^111Zef8a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Diagnostic Testing BLOOD AND SPUTUM CULTURES Routine blood and sputum cultures have not been shown to improve patient outcomes in CAP. Sputum cultures are recommended before treatment initiation only if the patient has severe CAP, and particularly if he or she is intubated; if the patient has a history of methicillin-resistant. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days.

The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results. URINARY ANTIGEN TESTING Urinary antigen testing for Legionella or pneumococcus has not been shown to improve outcomes. Based on low-quality evidence, the ATS/IDSA guideline suggests that routine urine testing for pneumococcal antigen be performed only in severe cases of CAP and that urine testing for Legionella antigen be performed only in cases of severe CAP, exposure to a Legionella outbreak, or travel to an endemic area. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia. Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes.

Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy.

### Antibiotic use and stewardship in the United States, 2024 update… [^113ogaHV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to improve antibiotic use so that antibiotics are prescribed and used when they provide a clear benefit.
- This report provides an overview of CDC's antibiotic stewardship activities and emphasizes the importance of fostering collaboration to improve patient safety across the spectrum of health care. Introduction Improving antibiotic use is a core strategy to optimize patient safety and combat antimicrobial resistance. CDC tracks antibiotic use and stewardship implementation data to evaluate progress and improve health care quality by identifying opportunities for improving prescribing. CDC's Office of Antibiotic Stewardship works with partners including healthcare organizations, academic researchers, professional societies, and public health and federal partners to improve antibiotic use and support stewardship implementation.

In 2023, 3, 153 acute care hospitals across the United States have submitted at least one month of data to the NHSN AU Option. In the coming years, more hospitals will be reporting to the NSHN AU Option through CMS's Promoting Interoperability Program. CDC authors outlined how expanded reporting and access to antibiotic use data can identify where prescribing can be improved and provide benchmarks for antibiotic stewardship programs. Enabling regional and national comparisons of antibiotic use, while taking into account antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infection data, will help inform, implement and assess stewardship interventions. Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Core Elements and Priorities CDC's Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship provides a framework for the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs.

The implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs in acute care hospitals is assessed through the NHSN Patient Safety Component Annual Hospital Survey. Staff in hospitals complete annual survey questions that assess the uptake of CDC's Core Elements. CDC reports the percentage of hospitals meeting the Core Elements by year and state. Findings from CDC studies Studies supported by CDC's Office of Antibiotic Stewardship help guide stewardship implementation strategies and identify opportunities for partners to optimize antibiotic use. CDC characterized antibiotic prescribing by general dentists during 2018–2022 to assess whether antibiotic use changed after the release of American Dental Association guidelines for the treatment of dental pain and swelling in 2019. The results highlight the importance of antibiotic stewardship in the dental setting.
- However, CDC observed that antibiotic prescribing approached or exceeded this 2019 baseline in the last quarter of 2022 for all antibiotics, including for azithromycin, suggesting a return to antibiotic prescribing trends observed prior to the pandemic.
- Effective implementation of antibiotic stewardship combined with tracking of antibiotic prescribing are needed to optimize antibiotic use in outpatient settings following the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for pneumonia… [^116ZbE3a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Panel A, Temporal trends in empiric extended and standard-spectrum days of therapy show sustained reductions in monthly extended-spectrum and increases in standard-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy in the intervention group that was evident early in the phase-in period. Effects persisted despite arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy and safety outcomes included days to intensive care unit transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies. Hospitals were randomly assigned to the routine or CPOE bundle group.

The routine antibiotic stewardship group received educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities for pneumonia per national guidance. Routine stewardship activities included providing hospital guidelines and protocols for antibiotic selection, requiring a documented indication for antibiotics, and prospectively evaluating antibiotic use with clinician feedback to deescalate antibiotics after microbiologic test results returned. In addition to routine stewardship activities, the CPOE bundle group received monthly coaching calls and the same educational material for maintaining national antibiotic stewardship guidance, plus CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum instead of extended-spectrum antibiotics during the first 3 hospital days for patients with a low absolute risk of MDRO pneumonia and clinician education and feedback reports.

For example, 2 different extended-spectrum antibiotics administered at least once during each of the first 3 days would yield 6 days of extended-spectrum therapy. The study had 97% power to detect a 12. 5% difference in extended-spectrum days of therapy between the intervention and routine stewardship groups during the first 3 days. Notably, there was a 32% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic doses per patient, from 3. 3 during the baseline period to
3. 3 during the intervention period for the routine stewardship group vs 3. 3 during the baseline period and
2. 2 during the intervention period for the CPOE bundle group.
