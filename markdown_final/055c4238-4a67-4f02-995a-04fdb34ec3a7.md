## Question

Dose of inhaled DOAC for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dose of an inhaled direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether an inhaled DOAC formulation even exists. Then, I should verify what DAH is and whether anticoagulation would ever be indicated in its management. Next, I will review evidence-based principles for managing DAH in patients exposed to anticoagulants, including reversal strategies. Finally, I will consider any role for local or inhaled therapies and synthesize a clear clinical recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the formulation question: DOACs are designed and approved as oral agents, not inhaled products, and current FDA labeling and contemporary guidance list apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran as orally administered agents with no inhalation route or nebulized formulation described or approved; I should double-check labels and guidance to be certain, but I see no evidence of any inhaled DOAC in clinical use or trials, and the FDA labels emphasize oral administration and bleeding risk, not inhaled delivery [^112cYXvg] [^114VLNv1] [^113tzMNH].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is any investigational or off-label inhaled anticoagulant that might be confused with a DOAC; hold on, I should not jump to conclusions, but scanning the contemporary DOAC reversal and stewardship literature, I still do not find any mention of an inhaled DOAC or an inhaled delivery pathway for these small molecules, reinforcing that "inhaled DOAC dosing" is a non-existent therapeutic concept in current practice [^113tzMNH] [^113odKgA].

> Next, I need to ensure I'm framing DAH correctly: DAH is a frequently catastrophic pulmonary bleeding syndrome, often occurring with hypoxemic respiratory failure, with reported high mortality after hematopoietic transplantation and in other contexts; importantly, anticoagulants can precipitate or exacerbate DAH rather than treat it, with warfarin- and antiplatelet-associated DAH reported, and epidemiologic summaries noting DAH is rare but severe, so I should be careful not to propose anticoagulation in an active alveolar bleed [^115q7oAv] [^117MmafW] [^115roiX4] [^116UDKTb] [^111rfKbW].

> I should confirm the core management principle: in a patient on a DOAC who develops DAH, the correct action is to stop the anticoagulant and promptly reverse it when bleeding is life-threatening, not to administer or continue anticoagulation; specific reversal includes idarucizumab 5 g IV for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for rivaroxaban/apixaban with dosing based on last dose and timing, with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate as a reasonable alternative when specific reversal is unavailable, and FDA labels emphasize discontinuation in active pathological hemorrhage, aligning with this approach [^113tzMNH] [^112cYXvg] [^114VLNv1].

> I will now examine supportive DAH therapies I need to consider alongside reversal: high-dose corticosteroids are commonly used in transplant-associated DAH with typical regimens of methylprednisolone pulses, though outcomes vary; many patients require invasive or noninvasive ventilation; adjunct hemostatic strategies such as recombinant factor VIIa have case-based support, whereas aminocaproic acid did not improve outcomes in a large cohort, so I should tailor these to severity and etiology while correcting platelets and coagulation parameters [^1138A1S5] [^111kFXtU] [^115q7oAv] [^111X5WuL] [^116S9UdN].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any inhaled hemostatic therapy could be conflated with an "inhaled DOAC": local or systemic hemostatic adjuncts have been explored in DAH, but these are prohemostatic agents, not anticoagulants, and contemporary DOAC bleeding reviews and emergency guidance make no mention of inhaled DOACs or inhaled reversal strategies, reinforcing that inhaled anticoagulation has no role in DAH management [^112WLAQr] [^111X5WuL].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic plausibility for a moment; DOACs were developed for predictable oral absorption and fixed dosing with systemic anticoagulation targets, and attempting inhaled delivery would create unpredictable pulmonary deposition without reliable systemic anticoagulant exposure and, worse, would be countertherapeutic in an alveolar bleed, so the formulation logic itself argues against any "inhaled DOAC dose" for DAH.

> To synthesize, I should be explicit: there is no dose of an inhaled DOAC for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage because inhaled DOACs do not exist, DAH is a bleeding emergency in which anticoagulation must be stopped and usually reversed, and evidence-based care focuses on prompt DOAC reversal when indicated, aggressive supportive management, and targeted hemostatic strategies based on the underlying cause and severity [^113tzMNH] [^112cYXvg] [^115q7oAv].

There is **no evidence or guideline support** for using inhaled direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) [^113tzMNH] [^112WLAQr]. DOACs are systemic agents [^115zT2yG] and are **contraindicated in active bleeding**, including DAH [^112cYXvg] [^114VLNv1]. If a patient on a DOAC develops DAH, the DOAC should be stopped immediately and specific reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors) or 4-factor PCC used if needed [^113tzMNH] [^1127MrCP]. There is no clinical rationale or published data for inhaled DOACs in DAH, and their use would likely worsen bleeding [^114FEJAq].

---

## Pharmacological considerations of DOACs in DAH

DOACs are systemic anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that do not require routine laboratory monitoring [^115zT2yG]; however, they are associated with **bleeding risks**, including major and potentially fatal hemorrhages [^112cYXvg] [^1152kT1b]. Use in patients with active bleeding, such as DAH, is **contraindicated** because of the risk of exacerbating hemorrhage [^114VLNv1] [^113tzMNH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **advise against** anticoagulant use, including DOACs, in patients with active bleeding, such as DAH [^113tzMNH]. Instead, recommended management for DAH includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation** of anticoagulant therapy [^112cYXvg] [^114FEJAq].
- **Administration of specific reversal agents** (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors) or non-specific reversal agents (4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate) if specific agents are unavailable [^113tzMNH] [^1127MrCP] [^111cVvde].
- **Supportive care** measures, including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation if necessary, and correction of underlying coagulopathies [^111xtKau] [^1138A1S5].

---

## Risks associated with DOAC use in DAH

Using DOACs in patients with DAH poses **significant risks**, including:

- **Exacerbation of bleeding**: DOACs can significantly worsen hemorrhagic conditions, leading to increased morbidity and mortality [^114VLNv1] [^114j8Xtr].
- **Lack of clinical evidence**: There is no clinical evidence or published literature supporting the use of DOACs, inhaled or otherwise, in the management of DAH.
- **Contraindications**: DOACs are explicitly contraindicated in patients with active pathological hemorrhage, including DAH [^112cYXvg] [^111cVvde].

---

## Alternative anticoagulation strategies

When anticoagulation is necessary for underlying thrombotic conditions, alternatives such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be considered [^114FEJAq]. These agents have **shorter half-lives and reversible effects**, allowing more controlled management of bleeding risk. However, use must be carefully balanced against the risk of exacerbating DAH and individualized based on patient-specific factors [^116BxmED].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for using inhaled DOACs to manage diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^113tzMNH]. DOACs are systemic anticoagulants and are contraindicated in active bleeding, such as DAH, because of the significant risk of exacerbating hemorrhage [^112cYXvg] [^114VLNv1]. Current clinical guidelines recommend immediate discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy, administration of reversal agents, and supportive care measures for patients with DAH [^113tzMNH] [^111xtKau]. Therefore, inhaled DOACs **should not be used** in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^114FEJAq].

### Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants: Guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^113tzMNH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

The currently approved direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in clinical practice. Although serious bleeding risks are lower with DOACs than with vitamin K antagonists, bleeding remains the most frequent side effect. Andexanet alfa and idarucizumab are the currently approved specific reversal agents for oral factor (F)Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, respectively. Our prior guidance document was published in 2016, but with more information available on the utility and increased use of these reversal agents and other bleeding management strategies, we have updated this International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidance document on DOAC reversal. In this narrative review, we compare the mechanism of action of specific and nonspecific reversal agents, review the clinical data supporting their use, and provide guidance on when reversal is indicated. In addition, we briefly discuss the reversal of oral FXIa inhibitors, a new class of DOACs currently under clinical development.

### Xarelto [^114VLNv1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Risk of bleeding**: Xarelto increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. When deciding whether to prescribe Xarelto to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue Xarelto in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.

- **Concomitant drug use**: The concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase the bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Risk of hemorrhage in acutely ill medical patients at high risk of bleeding**: Acutely ill medical patients with certain conditions are at increased risk of bleeding with the use of Xarelto for primary VTE prophylaxis. These conditions include a history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary hemorrhage, active cancer (i.e. undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), active gastroduodenal ulcer in the three months prior to treatment, and history of bleeding in the three months prior to treatment.

### Clinical guideline on reversal of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with life threatening bleeding [^1127MrCP]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is essential for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists in DOAC-eligible patients. The major complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening haemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt haemostatic intervention. Reversal of DOACs may also be required for patients in need of urgent invasive procedures. This guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) aims to provide evidence-based recommendations and suggestions on how to manage patients on DOACs undergoing urgent or emergency procedures, including the treatment of DOAC-induced bleeding.

- **Design**: A systematic literature search was performed, examining four drug comparators (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and clinical scenarios ranging from planned to emergency surgery with the outcomes of mortality, haematoma growth, and thromboembolic complications. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Consensus on the wording of the recommendations was achieved by a Delphi process.

- **Results**: So far, no results from prospective randomised trials comparing two active comparators (e.g. a direct reversal agent and an unspecific haemostatic agent such as prothrombin complex concentrate: PCC) have been published, and the majority of publications were uncontrolled and observational studies. Thus, the certainty of evidence was a…

### Eliquis [^112cYXvg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bleeding**: Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue Eliquis in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.

- **Reversal of anticoagulant effect**: An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. The pharmacodynamic effect of Eliquis can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e. for about two drug half-lives. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered but have not been evaluated in clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When PCCs are used, monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of apixaban using a clotting test (PT, INR, or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not useful and is not recommended. Activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration [see Overdosage (10)].

Hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Jantoven [^111RtpwT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The dosage and administration of Jantoven must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

	- **Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)**: Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kjRN8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

We conducted further analyses to explore substantial heterogeneity in major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage endpoints among AF patients with VHD. Apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, when compared to warfarin, reduced major bleeding (HR: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.91; P = 0.85 for heterogeneity; I² = 0%) among patients with VHD, whereas rivaroxaban compared to warfarin increased major bleeding (HR: 1.56; 95% CI, 1.20–2.04).

In patients with VHD, the use of apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran versus warfarin reduced intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25–0.45; P = 0.63 for heterogeneity; I² = 0%), whereas rivaroxaban versus warfarin did not show a difference in intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 1.27; 95% CI, 0.77–2.10).

- **Effect of different non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants**: Dabigatran and apixaban vs. rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation patients with valvular heart disease for safety endpoints.
	- **Major bleeding**: Patients received apixaban 5 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily had lower bleeding rates. In contrast, patients on rivaroxaban received 20 or 15 mg once daily and exhibited higher bleeding risks.
	- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Blood thinner choice significantly affects safety outcomes.

Abbreviations used:

- **ARISTOTLE**: Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation.
- **ENGAGE AF**: Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation.
- **RE-LY**: Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy.
- **ROCKET AF**: Rivaroxaban On Atrial Fibrillation.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112zc5WW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Very limited data exist on the role of NOACs in other hypercoagulable states, such as inherited coagulopathies (homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency, elevated levels of factors VII–XII) or nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with these conditions were significantly underrepresented in the trials. Dabigatran was prescribed to a 21-year-old woman with recurrent VTEs caused by protein C deficiency, which was complicated by warfarin-induced skin necrosis and an inability to maintain anticoagulation on LMWH. The patient did not experience any VTE recurrence during 6 months of follow-up.

Rivaroxaban was prescribed to a 30-year-old woman who had homozygosity of factor V Leiden mutation and sustained an ovarian vein thrombosis with proximal extension to the renal vein. The patient remained free of symptoms without recurrence of thrombi or bleeding complications.

Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been used for secondary prophylaxis in a few patients with nephrotic syndrome. Anticoagulation in these patients has traditionally been achieved with VKAs or heparins.

### Is there a role for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided dosing for novel oral anticoagulants [^115zT2yG]. American Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

The novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy, replacing vitamin K antagonists as the preferred options for many indications. Given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring, they have been shown to be at least as effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke as dose-adjusted warfarin in phase 3 randomized trials and are less likely to cause hemorrhagic stroke. Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic subanalyses of the major NOAC trials in patients with atrial fibrillation have established relationships between clinical characteristics and drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses with both efficacy and safety.

Based on these analyses, pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory authorities have provided contraindications and dosing recommendations based on clinical characteristics associated with drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses, stroke reduction, and bleeding risk to optimize the risk-benefit profile of the NOACs in the real world. The fixed-dosing strategy of NOACs has triggered discussions about the potential value of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment in customizing drug exposure to further improve the safety and efficacy of the NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation. As there is neither high-quality evidence nor consensus about the potential role of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment for the NOACs, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "Think Tank" meeting was held at the American College of Cardiology Heart House in December 2015 to discuss these issues.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^111Nt1ci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study provides a comprehensive overview and head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic performance of guideline-recommended DOAC-specific coagulation tests for the detection of clinically relevant DOAC concentrations. This distinguishes our report from prior studies, which investigated the performance of coagulation tests across the whole range of therapeutic drug concentrations but failed to inform about the clinically most important aspect: the tests' diagnostic accuracy for detecting patients with DOAC concentrations low enough to allow emergency surgery, thrombolysis, or that do not warrant anticoagulation reversal in case of bleeding. Unlike previous reports, we used real-life patient samples and the criterion standard for DOAC concentration measurement (UPLC-MS/MS) as a reference. We included three different coagulation assays for dabigatran measurement and provided a comparison of the impact of the FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban on calibrated as well as uncalibrated AXA.

Although our study includes a variety of DOAC-specific assays, we only used a single reagent for each type of test and thus cannot provide data comparing different test reagents. This limitation is particularly applicable to AXA, where a variety of reagents are available. However, reports comparing our reagent (Chromogenix COAMATIC Heparin Test) to other reagents for rivaroxaban and apixaban measurement found no difference in diagnostic performance. Our study does not include the FXa inhibitor edoxaban, as this information was not available.

### Safe and effective anticoagulation use: Case studies in anticoagulation stewardship [^113odKgA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant use is prevalent and associated with significant potential for harm. Anticoagulation stewardship practice has emerged to address care gaps and promote safe, effective, and cost-conscious anticoagulation use across health care systems. We present four patient cases describing common challenges in anticoagulation management: inappropriate dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, periprocedural anticoagulation management, and heavy menstrual bleeding on anticoagulation. We discuss available examples of successful stewardship programs that can address the challenges of each case, demonstrating how an investment in anticoagulation stewardship can improve patient outcomes.

### Comparison of fatal or irreversible events with extended-duration betrixaban versus standard dose enoxaparin in acutely ill medical patients: An APEX trial substudy [^111EYxvG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic interventions are associated with both efficacy benefits and safety hazards. The net clinical outcome of an intervention can be assessed by combining measures of efficacy and safety. Some events may be transient and reversible, resulting in no permanent harm, which makes them challenging to weigh against each other. One way to ensure that the clinical impact of the efficacy and safety events being compared is similar is to include only those events that are either fatal or result in irreversible cell death or harm to the patient.

The present study is a post hoc analysis of the APEX trial (Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention With Extended Duration Betrixaban Study), which evaluates net clinical outcomes by comparing a composite of fatal or irreversible efficacy and safety events in patients treated with extended-duration betrixaban versus standard dosing enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prevention among acute medically ill hospitalized patients. This article expands on the primary results of APEX, which assessed efficacy and safety endpoints independently. Additionally, the endpoint evaluated in this study includes only symptomatic events and therefore could be assessed in the modified intent-to-treat population, as opposed to the primary efficacy outcome population, which was used for the primary results.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is most often fatal and is affected by graft source, conditioning regimen toxicity, and engraftment kinetics [^115q7oAv]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a frequently fatal complication with no standard therapy. Although significant changes in supportive and intensive care measures for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been made over the past decades, the impact of these changes on the incidence and outcome of patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has not been examined.

We analyzed 1,228 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2008 and 2015 at the University of Minnesota to study the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed in 5% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, at a median of 30 days (range +3 to +168 days) after transplantation. The incidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was significantly greater in recipients of umbilical cord blood than peripheral blood or bone marrow grafts (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.16–3.74; P = 0.01).

In multivariate analysis, delayed neutrophil engraftment or primary graft failure was a risk factor for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage following peripheral blood or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HR: 5.51, 95% CI: 1.26–24; P = 0.02) and delayed platelet engraftment was associated with significantly increased diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in umbilical cord blood transplant recipients (HR: 6.96, 95% CI: 2.39–20.29; P < 0.05). Myeloablative regimens including total body irradiation were also risk factors for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (HR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.03–3.1).

### Meta-analysis of haematoma volume, haematoma expansion and mortality in intracerebral haemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant use [^114j8Xtr]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The report was prepared with respect to the PRISMA recommendations. The analysis was performed from November 2018 to January 2019 according to a pre-planned protocol developed by all investigators in October 2018 (not published).

- **Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria**: Two investigators independently searched PubMed/MEDLINE for relevant publications on 31 October 2018 and 14 November 2018. We used the following search terms: [(oral anticoagulants OR vitamin K antagonists OR novel oral anticoagulants OR direct oral anticoagulants OR non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants) AND (ICH) AND (mortality or volume)] including different spellings and common abbreviations (i.e. VKA, NOAC, DOAC, ICH).

	- Inclusion criteria: Original studies published in English; comparing OAC-ICH (either VKA-ICH or NOAC-ICH or both) with non-OAC ICH; recruiting patients from the same population (hospital-based or population-based studies); reporting at least one of the following outcomes for both types of ICH (OAC-ICH and non-OAC ICH): mortality, haematoma volume, or haematoma expansion.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Studies with fewer than 10 participants with OAC-ICH; studies reporting matched cohorts rather than consecutive patients.

- **Data collection**: Two authors independently performed the literature research and screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility. We read the full text of potentially eligible articles and independently extracted data on study design, demographics, and outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by colleagues.

### Anticoagulant treatment regimens in patients with Covid-19: A meta-analysis [^112n6B96]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis comprises 10 trials involving over 5,000 patients, comparing higher-dose with prophylactic-dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In the overall study population, higher-dose anticoagulation was not associated with lower mortality compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. This key finding aligns with guidelines that do not recommend the routine administration of greater than prophylactic doses of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Similarly, a recently published meta-analysis that included seven trials showed no survival benefit with higher-dose anticoagulation. Our analyses incorporated three additional trials and could confirm previous findings. Although higher-dose anticoagulation decreased the risk of venous thromboembolism, it also increased the risk of major bleeding to a similar extent. These counteracting effects appear to offset each other regarding all-cause death.

These results predominantly apply to a population that largely excluded patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy or those with an increased risk of bleeding. All trials, except for the HESACOVID and XCOVID-19 trials, explicitly excluded patients with low platelet count (< 50,000 or < 100,000/µL). The net benefit of higher-dose anticoagulation in these relevant groups remains unknown.

- **Summary of key outcomes**: Net adverse clinical events are a composite of death, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding. CI, confidence interval.

This analysis underscores the complexity and potential risks associated with adjusting anticoagulation dosages in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the need for individualized patient assessment.

### Practical considerations in emergency management of bleeding in the setting of target-specific oral anticoagulants [^115yJwRc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The recent arrival of the target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) offers potential advantages in the field of anticoagulation. However, there are no rapid, accurate, and routinely available laboratory assays to evaluate their contribution to clinical bleeding. With the expanding clinical indications for the TSOACs and the arrival of newer reversal agents on the market, the emergency clinician will need to be familiar with drug specifics as well as methods for anticoagulation reversal. This review offers a summary of the literature and provides practical strategies for approaching patients taking TSOACs and managing bleeding in these cases.

### Select drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: JACC review topic of the week [^111UcWtA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States require long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant. For decades, vitamin K antagonists were the only oral option available; however, they have a number of well-known limitations. The introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has long been considered a major therapeutic advance, largely because they lack the need for therapeutic monitoring. Despite this, DOACs, like vitamin K antagonists, can still cause major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, even when used appropriately.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving the DOACs represent an important contributor to increased bleeding risk. Awareness of these DDIs and how best to address them is of critical importance in optimizing management while mitigating bleeding risk. This review provides an overview of DOAC metabolism, the most common drugs likely to contribute to DOAC DDIs, their underlying mechanisms, and how best to address them.

### Coumadin [^116Z36Ej]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Individualized dosing**: The dosage and administration of Coumadin must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. It is important to adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in determining the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with Coumadin [see References (15)].

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

	- Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]): Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### A life-threatening complication of warfarin therapy in ED: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^115roiX4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin has several serious adverse effects, with bleeding being one of the most significant and frequent. In this case report, we present diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as a rare and life-threatening complication of warfarin therapy.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology, Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, these new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants possess pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin.

This paper:

- **Compares** the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin.
- **Identifies the class effects** of these drugs and their differentiating features.
- **Reviews their indications**.
- **Uses this information** to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality related to bleeding, as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In recent years, several competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed. Each aims to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements. Currently, one oral direct thrombin inhibitor and two direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Clinical efficacy and safety profiles**: We compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs.
- **Laboratory assays**: Various laboratory assays may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances.
- **Emerging strategies**: We discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency.

The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and the management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in cirrhosis of the liver: Are low-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants a reasonable alternative to warfarin [^117R2t7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this large observational study makes a significant contribution to the literature on the potential use of NOAC therapy in Asian patients with AF and cirrhosis. Low-dose NOAC therapy may be safe and efficacious in this setting in the short term, despite the known differences in risk profiles and outcomes in Asian populations with AF combined with the balance of thrombosis and bleeding in cirrhosis. Some additional areas of uncertainty remain unanswered, however, and we thus look forward to future studies that may help us continue to reduce the burden of AF and stroke in Asia and elsewhere.

### Recommendations for research assessing outcomes for patients with anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds [^112Zpykq]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Intracerebral bleeds related to anticoagulant use have a poor prognosis and a substantial risk of disability and death. Recent publications evaluating replacement or reversal therapies for anticoagulants lack consistency in controlling for key factors that significantly influence outcomes.

To guide future research and improve consistency, we provide an overview of variables critical in studies evaluating the risk and reversal of anticoagulant therapies in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds. Hematoma expansion is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors. Its early control could mitigate secondary brain injury, therefore requiring careful categorization.

- **Baseline factors**: Include demographic, clinical, and radiological predictors of hematoma expansion.
- **Time-dependent factors**: These are especially critical and include the time from the last dose, time from symptom onset, and time to treatment. The computed tomography angiography spot sign and the limitation of early care are also critical predictors of outcomes in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds.

Intracerebral hemorrhage requires fast diagnosis and treatment, especially when associated with anticoagulants. The advent of therapies with rapid reversal of anticoagulation creates opportunities to assess how faster reversal of anticoagulation modifies hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect, based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain.

One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. Another example is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### New oral anticoagulants and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage: Traditional and Bayesian meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison of randomized trials of new oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation [^1152kT1b]. JAMA Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Randomized studies have demonstrated a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with the use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). However, it is unclear whether the magnitude of benefit is similar for all NOACs currently available.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the rates of ICH within the framework of both conventional and Bayesian statistics.

- **Data sources**: The MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and EBSCO databases were searched up to December 1, 2012, supplemented with conference abstracts, and with no language restriction.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials comparing NOACs versus a comparator and reporting on ICH events were selected.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The NOACs were pooled to perform a comparison with all comparators and among themselves in both traditional frequentist and Bayesian random-effects models. This involved using vague priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling, calculating pooled odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals, as well as numbers needed to treat and 95% credible intervals for the Bayesian analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Intracranial hemorrhage events associated with NOACs in comparison with comparators, expressed as odds ratios.

- **Results**: Six studies (1 administering dabigatran etexilate mesylate, 2 administering rivaroxaban, and 3 administering apixaban) enrolling a total of 57,491 patients were included for analysis. The NOACs significantly reduced the risk of ICH against all comparators (odds ratio = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36–0.65). Each of the three drugs reduced the risk of ICH.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^114Q8wix]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can travel from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, up to the lungs. Previously, a pulmonary embolism was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. Recently, however, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. The new drugs have characteristics that may be favorable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. At the time of writing, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment (minimum duration of three months) of pulmonary embolism.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). Clinical trials databases were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a pulmonary embolism confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the long-term (minimum duration) treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: Nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114zvTFN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for epistaxis, particularly concerning patients on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, the AAO-HNSF 2020 guidelines recommend initiating first-line treatments before considering transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications. This approach is advised for patients using these medications, provided there is no life-threatening bleeding.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - is there a general consensus [^115gA9VY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

While VKAs have traditionally been the mainstay for anticoagulation, DOACs represent a major development in treating and preventing venous thromboembolic disease and in suppressing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation. Interest in DOAC therapy has increased significantly over time, with prescription claims rising from 15.4% to 31.0% of all oral anticoagulant claims between 2013 and 2015, according to US Medicare data. Google Trend data also indicate an increasing global interest in DOAC therapy; the greatest number of searches for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban between 2012 and 2017 were conducted in North America, central/eastern Europe, and Australia. Interest in edoxaban was less pronounced and restricted to Germany, Japan, and the United States. Interest in warfarin therapy, in contrast to DOAC therapy, has decreased significantly over time.

A key issue with guidelines is that they become out of date as soon as they are published, due to the continuous publication of new clinical data. This is especially relevant for DOAC reversal, with several guidelines published prior to the approval of andexanet alfa. Attempts are being made to update guidelines to address the use of this agent. Recent clinical data support the use of 4F-PCC in VKA reversal and also DOAC reversal if specific agents are not available, while currently available clinical data on idarucizumab as well as andexanet alfa support their use in specific DOAC reversal. It is likely that anticoagulation reversal guidelines will continue to evolve, particularly in the case of specific DOAC reversals.

### High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are prognostic factors of higher in-hospital mortality in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111kFXtU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

During the study period, 147 patients were suspected of having diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). However, 79 patients were excluded for the following reasons: bronchoscopy was not performed (n = 59), hemorrhage from bronchial origin was responsible for the symptoms (n = 3), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) findings were not compatible with DAH (n = 2), and the data of the BALF cell pattern were not obtained (n = 15). Consequently, 68 patients were included in our analysis.

- **Patient characteristics**: The median age was 75 years (interquartile range 72–80), and 49 patients (72%) were male. Forty-eight patients (71%) were receiving antithrombotic therapy (AT); 7 (10%) received antiplatelet therapy alone, 23 (34%) received anticoagulant therapy alone, and 18 (26%) received both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies. The etiological diseases of DAH were categorized as immune disease (8.8%), infection (13%), drug-induced pneumonitis (5.9%), heart failure (4.4%), other diseases (13%), and idiopathic (54%). No variables were significantly different between the survival and death groups.

- **Clinical characteristics on admission**: Forty-seven patients (69%) received invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Fifty-six patients (82%) were administered corticosteroids. Neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages in BALF, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were significantly different between the survival and death groups.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^1111TYHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition where a clot can migrate from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, to the lungs. Conventional treatment of PE used unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. DOACs have characteristics that may be favorable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. This review reports the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment of PE (minimum duration of three months). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of PE.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 March 2022. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a PE confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^112bxPYQ]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices.

Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following:

- **Platelet count monitoring**: For patients receiving heparin in whom the clinician considers the risk of HIT to be greater than 1.0%, we recommend platelet count monitoring over no platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C).

- **Diagnosis of HIT**: For patients who are receiving heparin or have received heparin within the previous two weeks, we recommend investigating a diagnosis of HIT if the platelet count falls by ≥ 50% and/or a thrombotic event occurs between days 5 and 14 (inclusive) following initiation of heparin, even if the patient is no longer receiving heparin therapy when thrombosis or thrombocytopenia has occurred (Grade 1C).

- **Alternative anticoagulant use**: For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant (danaparoid [Grade 1B], lepirudin [Grade 1C], argatroban [Grade 1C], fondaparinux [Grade 2C], or bivalirudin [Grade 2C]) over the further use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy or the initiation/continuation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) [Grade 1B].

The guidelines include specific recommendations for…

### Xarelto [^111cVvde]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage of Xarelto can lead to hemorrhage. If bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur, discontinue Xarelto and initiate appropriate therapy. Rivaroxaban systemic exposure is not further increased at single doses greater than 50 mg due to limited absorption. The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of Xarelto overdose may be considered. Due to the high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Partial reversal of laboratory anticoagulation parameters may be achieved with the use of plasma products. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available.

### Argatroban [^112xWTFz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When converting patients from argatroban to oral anticoagulant therapy, consider the potential for combined effects on INR with the co-administration of argatroban and warfarin. A loading dose of warfarin should not be used; instead, initiate therapy using the expected daily dose of warfarin. To avoid prothrombotic effects and ensure continuous anticoagulation when initiating warfarin, it is suggested that argatroban and warfarin therapy be overlapped. However, there are insufficient data available to recommend the duration of this overlap.

- **Co-administration of warfarin and argatroban injection at doses up to 2 mcg/kg/min**: Measure INR daily while argatroban injection and warfarin are co-administered. In general, with doses of argatroban injection up to 2 mcg/kg/min, argatroban injection can be discontinued when the INR is greater than 4 during combined therapy. After discontinuing argatroban injection, repeat the INR measurement in 4 to 6 hours. If the repeat INR is below the desired therapeutic range, resume the infusion of argatroban injection and repeat the procedure daily until the desired therapeutic range on warfarin alone is reached.

- **Co-administration of warfarin and argatroban injection at doses greater than 2 mcg/kg/min**: For doses of argatroban greater than 2 mcg/kg/min, the relationship of INR between warfarin alone and the INR on warfarin plus argatroban is less predictable. In this case, to predict the INR on warfarin alone, temporarily reduce the dose of argatroban injection to a dose of 2 mcg/kg/min.

### Comparison of different direct oral anticoagulant regimens in atrial fibrillation patients with high bleeding risk [^113KwxPz]. Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

The optimal dose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to prevent ischemic stroke (IS) and systemic thromboembolism (STE) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with a predisposing bleeding risk remains unclear.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of different DOAC dosage regimens in AF patients with high bleeding risk but low thrombosis risk.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study was conducted using the National Health Insurance claims database in Taiwan. It included AF patients aged 20 to 75 years, under DOAC therapy, with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 for males and 2 for females, and a HAS-BLED score ≥ 3. The standard-dose regimen was defined as dabigatran 300 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, apixaban 10 mg, or edoxaban 60 mg per day. Any other lower-dose regimen was defined as the low-dose regimen. The primary outcomes were IS and major bleeding (MB). The secondary outcomes included STE, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and cardiovascular death.

- **Results**: A total of 964 patients were included (52.1% standard-dose regimen). The median HAS-BLED score was 3 [interquartile range 3–3]. Compared with the standard-dose group, patients in the low-dose group had a significantly increased risk of IS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 5.13; 95% confidence interval 1.37–19.22) and STE (aHR 3.14 [1.05–9.37]), but a similar risk of MB (aHR 0.45 [0.12–1.67]). The risks of other hemorrhages and cardiovascular death were similar between the two dose groups.

- **Conclusion**: Among patients with a predominant bleeding risk but relatively low thrombos… (Note: The original text was truncated and ends abruptly here.)

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare complication of clopidogrel use [^116UDKTb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) has been reported as a rare complication of clopidogrel use and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. We describe the case of an 88-year-old Native American woman who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, with a CT scan of the chest showing diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. She had been on clopidogrel for 6 months for a carotid artery stent. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies revealed DAH. Infectious and autoimmune work-ups were all negative. Clopidogrel was stopped and high-dose steroids were started. Her symptoms gradually improved until she was discharged from the hospital. The differential diagnosis for DAH is broad. Anticoagulant-induced DAH should be part of the differential diagnosis and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is most often fatal and is affected by graft source, conditioning regimen toxicity, and engraftment kinetics [^117MmafW]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a frequently fatal complication with no standard therapy. Although significant changes in supportive and intensive care measures for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been made over the past decades, the impact of these changes on the incidence and outcome of patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has not been examined. We analyzed 1,228 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2008 and 2015 at the University of Minnesota to study the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed in 5% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, at a median of 30 days (range +3 to +168 days) after transplantation. The incidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was significantly greater in recipients of umbilical cord blood than peripheral blood or bone marrow grafts (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.16–3.74; P = 0.01).

- **Risk factors**:
	- **In multivariate analysis**:
		- Delayed neutrophil engraftment or primary graft failure was a risk factor for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage following peripheral blood or bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HR: 5.51, 95% CI: 1.26–24; P = 0.02).
		- Delayed platelet engraftment was associated with significantly increased diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in umbilical cord blood transplant recipients (HR: 6.96, 95% CI: 2.39–20.29; P < 0.05).
	- Myeloablative regimens including total body irradiation were also risk factors for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (HR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.03–3.1).

### Current strategies for the management of bleeding associated with direct oral anticoagulants and a review of investigational reversal agents [^112WLAQr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The management of life-threatening bleeding in patients who are receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is a serious medical concern.

This review provides a concise, balanced overview of the current and future approaches for reversing the anticoagulation effects of DOACs, particularly factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors.

- **Discussion**: The anticoagulant activity of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran can be reversed by idarucizumab. However, until recently, options for the management of major bleeding in patients receiving FXa inhibitors were limited to nonspecific strategies, including supplementation of clotting factors with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or activated PCCs for attenuating anticoagulation effects. These options appear as a treatment choice in many hospital guidelines despite the lack of approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the lack of rigorous medical evidence supporting their use in this setting. The development of specific reversal agents may provide improved strategies for the management of bleeding. Andexanet alfa is a modified FXa molecule approved in the United States to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Ciraparantag is a small-molecule inhibitor of multiple anticoagulants that has been investigated in healthy subjects.

- **Conclusion**: Guidelines for the management of DOAC-associated bleeding are being updated to reflect that the reversal agent for rivaroxaban and apixaban is now available.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - is there a general consensus [^113G5iNF]? The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This is a narrative review based on relevant US and international anticoagulation management and reversal guidelines published prior to April 2020. These were identified through PubMed and Internet searches using the search terms "(anticoagulant reversal guidelines) OR anticoagulation reversal guidelines". Where appropriate, the authors supplemented the searches according to their own understanding of the subject area.

Clinical studies and reviews/meta-analyses published after January 1, 2018, were identified using similar search terms in PubMed: ((anticoagulant reversal) OR anticoagulation reversal) AND ("2018/01/01"[Date - Publication]: "3000"[Date - Publication]). Clinical studies and key reviews/meta-analyses focusing on the efficacy/safety of non-specific anticoagulation reversal agents in VKA and DOAC reversal were included, as were articles focusing on the efficacy/safety of idarucizumab in dabigatran reversal and the efficacy/safety of andexanet alfa in rivaroxaban/apixaban reversal. We selected the January 1, 2018, cut-off to capture recent important studies reported after the guidelines were published and thus not considered by those panels.

### Dabigatran bleed risk with closed head injuries: are we prepared [^111UXFpb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has recently been approved in the US as an alternative to warfarin. The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). Confronted with this new problem, the authors reviewed their initial clinical experience.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed all cases of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who sustained CHI secondary to ground-level falls and who presented to the authors' provisional regional Level I trauma center between February 2011 and May 2011. The authors divided these patients into three groups based on anticoagulant therapy: dabigatran, warfarin, and no anticoagulants.

- **Results**: Between February 2011 and May 2011, CHIs from ground-level falls were sustained by 5 patients while on dabigatran, by 15 patients on warfarin, and by 25 patients who were not on anticoagulants. The treatment of the patients on dabigatran at the authors' institution had great diversity. Repeat CT scans obtained during reversal showed 4 of 5 patients with new or expanded hemorrhages in the dabigatran group, whereas the warfarin group had 3 of 15 (p = 0.03). The overall mortality rate for patients sustaining CHI on dabigatran was 2 (40%) of 5, whereas that of the warfarin group was 0 (0%) of 15 (p = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: It is critical for physicians involved in the care of patients with CHI on dabigatran to be aware of an elevated mortality rate if no treatment protocols are in place.

### Management of haemarthrosis in patients on oral anticoagulants [^114ui6Qn]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Use of oral anticoagulation therapy continues to increase. Anticoagulants are important in both the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolic complications. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin or activated factor X, are licensed for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following orthopaedic surgery.

The incidence of haemarthrosis associated with warfarin and NOACs ranges from 0 to 1.5% of patients. Although the incidence is low, as the use of NOACs and warfarin continues to rise, it is likely to increase in the future.

The management of haemarthrosis in this patient group is challenging. Several questions confront the clinician: When should the anticoagulants be held? What is the role of joint aspiration? What adjunctive therapies are available? The literature available to guide practice is limited to case reports and small case series. According to recommendations, a single episode of acute haemarthrosis associated with oral anticoagulants should be managed by rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) principles, temporary cessation of anticoagulation where possible, and potential aspiration of the joint.

Our aim was to investigate the approach to these patients in the Orthopaedic Department at a central London District General Hospital over four years and highlight the outcomes of different management strategies.

### Emergency care of patients receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^114FEJAq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), have been introduced for several clinical indications. Although NOACs have a favorable benefit-risk profile and can be used without routine laboratory monitoring, they are associated — as any anticoagulant — with a risk of bleeding. Additionally, treatment may need to be interrupted in patients requiring surgery or other procedures. This article's objective, developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts in thrombosis and haemostasis, is to provide an update on the management of NOAC-treated patients who experience a bleeding episode or require an urgent procedure. Recent advances in the development of targeted reversal agents are expected to help streamline the management of NOAC-treated patients in whom rapid reversal of anticoagulation is required.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be associated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in a patient with systemic risk factors [^117KxtEt]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

The authors present a rare case where acute respiratory failure occurred after the intravitreal bevacizumab injection for a branch retinal vein occlusion. Chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lung fields. The finding of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed alveolar haemorrhage. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of respiratory failure. This report suggests that intravitreal injection of bevacizumab may be associated with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and acute lung injury.

### Rivaroxaban-induced severe diffuse intracerebral hemorrhage [^112tyJdM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Bleeding, the most serious adverse effect of anticoagulants, may occur in various parts of the body. Comparing intracerebral hemorrhage in individuals using anticoagulant drugs to those with normal coagulation function, it is observed that the volume of bleeding is increased, and the prognosis is poorer. There are limited studies in the literature regarding intracerebral hemorrhage and the associated bleeding volume and prognosis related to rivaroxaban, a relatively new oral anticoagulant. Therefore, this article presents the clinical and radiological findings, along with the follow-up, of an 80-year-old male patient with intracerebral hemorrhage who uses rivaroxaban for anticoagulation.

### Cablivi [^112WsyJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious and potentially fatal bleeding can occur with the use of Cablivi. The risk of hemorrhage is increased in patients who have underlying coagulopathies or are on concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. If clinically significant bleeding arises, it is advised to interrupt the treatment. Cablivi should be withheld for seven days prior to elective surgery, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions.

- **Hemorrhage**: Cablivi increases the risk of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies, severe bleeding adverse reactions such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and metrorrhagia were each reported in 1% of subjects. Overall, bleeding events were observed in approximately 58% of patients on Cablivi compared to 43% of patients on placebo. In postmarketing settings, cases of life-threatening and fatal bleeding have been reported in patients receiving Cablivi.

- **Increased risk factors**: The risk of bleeding is elevated in patients with underlying coagulopathies, such as hemophilia and other coagulation factor deficiencies. This risk is also heightened with concomitant use of Cablivi alongside drugs affecting hemostasis and coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consequently, the concurrent use of Cablivi with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants should be avoided. If significant bleeding occurs, interrupt the use of Cablivi. If necessary, von Willebrand factor concentrate may be administered to rapidly correct hemostasis. Upon restarting Cablivi, close monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential.

- **Pre-surgery caution**: Cablivi should be withheld for seven days prior to elective surgery, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: May 2021 update on the use of intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^112ZPw5m]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant public health impact. As of 2 May 2021, more than 152 million cases and 3.2 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19–related illness globally. It is estimated that 5% to 20% of infected patients require hospital admission, of whom 5% to 15% may develop critical illness requiring intensive care support.

Patients with critical illness resulting from COVID-19 may develop a severe inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction, which may result in platelet activation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and a hypercoagulable state. Several laboratory predictors of thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been reported, including elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19, occurring in up to 23% of such patients. This was observed in the early days of the pandemic, but it remains an important issue even with the introduction of improved treatments in subsequent waves of the pandemic. In addition, arterial thrombotic complications, including stroke, have been noted. Microvascular thrombosis, which may involve the pulmonary vasculature and other organs, has been reported in autopsy studies, although its impact on the development of respiratory and multiorgan failure remains unclear.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115GWqZC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

When assessing anticoagulant activity in the emergency department (ED), understanding the level of anticoagulation in patients known or suspected to be on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is often crucial. There are several scenarios where this assessment is particularly important:

- **Overdose without symptoms**: A patient might have unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on their OAC. While there are no overt symptoms, routine monitoring — such as an elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) in the case of warfarin — could indicate an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.

- **Bleeding episodes**: Patients may present with spontaneous external or internal bleeding, or in some cases, the bleeding may only be suspected.

- **Bleeding due to injury**: An injury leading to external or internal bleeding requires careful assessment of anticoagulation levels.

- **Urgent procedures**: In cases where urgent surgical or other invasive procedures become necessary due to trauma or acute illness, it is essential for the surgical team to ascertain the patient's level of anticoagulation to proceed safely.

### Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants: Population based retrospective cohort study [^1155UGPj]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the insights these trials provide, the real-world safety of these novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin, from limited observational studies, is less clear. Such safety may diverge from the trial results due to several reasons, including trials' selective inclusion criteria and the limited duration of these investigations. Information on findings regarding gastrointestinal safety will allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of these agents.

Gastrointestinal bleeding carries substantial morbidity and mortality. In the United States in 2009, an estimated 140,000 or more hospital admissions had the principal diagnoses of gastrointestinal bleeding, and their aggregate costs reached $1.15 billion (£0.77bn; €1.06bn). The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom was 103 cases per 100,000 adults per year. Among patients admitted to hospitals with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom in 2007, the overall mortality rate was 10%; among UK patients with atrial fibrillation with warfarin-induced gastrointestinal bleeding, 6% of such bleeds are fatal.

Post-marketing reports have noted instances of major bleeding associated with dabigatran among older patients, those at the extremes of body weight, and those with impaired renal function. Such patients have been largely excluded from the trials. Approximately 25% of the bleeding events in post-marketing reports were associated with prescribing and dosing errors. Concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs with dabigatran increases the risk of bleeding.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary to warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation: a case report and literature review [^113cdJV6]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is a rare and serious medical emergency with many causes. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage due to warfarin therapy has been rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we describe the case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, who was admitted to our institution with haemoptysis and dyspnoea. Alveolar haemorrhage was suspected clinically and subsequently confirmed by bronchoscopy. The patient required aggressive treatment with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, and mechanical ventilation, resulting in a successful outcome. We emphasise the need for early diagnosis and fast therapeutic intervention, especially with over-anticoagulation (INR > 9), in patients with this rare and potentially lethal condition.

### Interruption and reversal of direct oral anticoagulants in preprocedural and acute settings [^115oT3E4]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018).

With increasing physician and patient awareness, the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been steadily increasing in recent years. Unfortunately, given their recent introduction, the reversal of anticoagulation attained with DOACs is not well studied. Given the diverse mechanisms of action of these newer agents, no universal antidote is available for reversal. Laboratory assays that can accurately quantify the anticoagulation status of patients on DOAC therapy are not readily available, which presents a challenge in situations demanding rapid reversal. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of reversal agents have not been extensively investigated in the clinical setting. This review briefly summarizes commercially available DOACs, delineates knowledge related to reversal of DOAC agents in specific clinical settings, and identifies areas of future study.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^115H5NsZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic affecting all countries in the world. Italy has been particularly afflicted by the health emergency, and since the peak phase has passed, there is major concern regarding medium- to long-term complications due to COVID-19. Little is known in the literature regarding thromboembolic complications once healed after COVID-19.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old patient recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) came to the hospital for palpitations and chest pain. Although he was on a treatment dose of direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC), massive recurrent PE was diagnosed.

- **Conclusion**: In the early post-COVID-19 era, the question remains regarding the efficacy of DOACs in COVID-19 patients.

### What we have learned about direct oral anticoagulant reversal [^116BxmED]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the main complication of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, with major bleeds occurring in about 2% to 4% of OAC-treated patients per year. Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) reduce the risk of major, fatal, and intracranial hemorrhage, major DOAC-related bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with case-fatality rates of 8% to 15% reported. Specific reversal agents for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet) correct laboratory indices of anticoagulant effect. Clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients receiving these agents for DOAC-associated major bleeds experience clinical hemostasis.

However, uncertainty remains regarding the incremental benefit of these agents and prothrombin complex concentrates over supportive measures alone, based on cohort studies that lacked control groups. Similar methodologic limitations preclude firm conclusions regarding the harms associated with use of these agents. Importantly, patients with DOAC-related major bleeding have substantial short-term risks of thrombosis and mortality. This emphasizes the need for individualized patient assessment and protocolized bleed management strategies that include assessment of candidacy for safe resumption of OACs. With expanding indications and increasing prevalence of DOAC-eligible patients, bleeding complications and their management represent an ever-greater major health problem.

### Low-, medium- and high-dose steroids with or without aminocaproic acid in adult hematopoietic SCT patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^116S9UdN]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a poorly understood complication of transplantation that carries a high mortality rate. Patients commonly deteriorate and require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment with high-dose steroids and aminocaproic acid (ACA) has been suggested. The study examined 119 critically ill adult hematopoietic transplant patients treated for DAH. Patients were subdivided into low-, medium-, and high-dose steroid groups, with or without ACA. All groups had similar baseline characteristics and severity of illness scores.

The primary objectives were assessing 30-, 60-, and 100-day, ICU, and hospital mortality. Overall mortality (n = 119) on day 100 was high at 85%. In the steroids and ACA cohort (n = 82), there were no significant differences in 30-, 60-, or 100-day, ICU, and hospital mortality between the dosing groups. In the steroids-only cohort (n = 37), the low-dose steroid group had lower ICU and hospital mortality (P = 0.02). Adjunctive treatment with ACA did not produce differences in outcomes. In multivariate analysis, medium- and high-dose steroids were associated with higher ICU mortality (P = 0.01) than the low-dose group. Our data suggest that treatment strategies may need to be reanalyzed to avoid potentially unnecessary and potentially harmful therapies.

### The safety of oral anticoagulants registry (SOAR): A national, ED-based study of the evaluation and management of bleeding and bleeding concerns due to the use of oral anticoagulants [^112T8qTP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Safety of Oral Anticoagulants Registry (SOAR) was designed to describe the evaluation and management of patients with oral anticoagulant (OAC)-related major bleeding or bleeding concerns who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute illness or injury. Patients in the ED are increasingly taking anticoagulants, which can cause bleeding-related complications as well as impact the acute management of related or unrelated clinical issues that prompt presentation. Modifications of emergency evaluation and management due to anticoagulation have not previously been studied.

This was a multicenter observational in-hospital study of patients who were judged to be experiencing an active OAC effect and had either an obvious bleeding event or were deemed at risk for serious bleeding spontaneously, after injury, or during an indicated invasive procedure. Diagnostic testing, therapies employed, and clinical outcomes were collected.

Thirty-one US hospitals contributed data to SOAR. Of 1513 subjects, acute hemorrhage (AH) qualified 78%, while 22% had a bleeding concern (BC). Warfarin was the index OAC in 37.3%, dabigatran in 13.3%, and an anti-Factor Xa in 49.4%. The most common sites of AH were gastrointestinal (51.0%) and intracranial (26.8%). In warfarin-treated patients, the mean (IQR) presenting INR was 3.1 (2.2, 4.8) in AH patients and 3.9 (2.4, 7.2) in BC patients. Three-fifths of SOAR patients were treated with factor repletion or specific reversal agents, and those patients had a longer length of stay.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is most often fatal and is affected by graft source, conditioning regimen toxicity, and engraftment kinetics [^1138A1S5]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Supportive measures for the management of alveolar hemorrhage included correction of platelet and coagulation abnormalities, careful maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, and aggressive ventilator and oxygen support. All patients received prophylactic and empiric antimicrobial agents as clinically indicated. Corticosteroids, administered in most patients (> 90%), consisted of a standard regimen of high-dose methylprednisolone: 500 mg twice a day for 3 days, followed by 250 mg twice a day for 3 days, 125 mg twice a day for 3 days, 60 mg twice a day for 3 days, and then 60 mg once a day tapered off over a 2-month period. Pediatric patients also received a similar dose and schedule of methylprednisolone with the dose adjusted per body surface area (i.e. starting dose 250 mg/m²/dose intravenously, twice a day for 3 days).

Neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5×10/L. Event times for neutrophil and platelet recovery were measured from the date of transplantation and were censored for death or disease progression before day 21 without neutrophil recovery. Platelet engraftment was defined as the first day when the platelet count was > 20×10/L and subsequently remained so without transfusions for 7 days. Neutrophil counts that never decreased below 0.5×10/L and platelet counts that never decreased below 20×10/L (without transfusion support) were defined as indicating engraftment at day +1 for either cell lineage. Primary graft failure was defined as a lack of neutrophil recovery.

### Treatment of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after allogeneic bone marrow transplant with recombinant factor VIIa [^111X5WuL]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary toxicity that occurs in 1–21% of patients following bone marrow transplantation. The syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate and treatment options are limited. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, Novoseven) has recently been approved for the treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A/B with inhibitors. A greater understanding of the mechanism by which rFVIIa restores hemostasis has recently become available, with in vitro evidence supporting that the thrombin burst achieved by rFVIIa is independent of the presence or binding to tissue factor. This insight has suggested a range of other potential clinical uses for the drug, including in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.

We review our experience with using rFVIIa for treatment of DAH in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia following a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Boluses of 90 microg/kg rFVIIa were given every 3 hours x 4 doses/day, concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids and maintenance of a platelet count > 50,000/mm³. Rapid clinical and radiological improvement was noted within several doses of rFVIIa, with discontinuation of the drug after eight doses. However, the patient's clinical condition began to rapidly deteriorate following cessation of rFVIIa, resulting in reinstitution of therapy 24 hours later. The patient again exhibited rapid clinical improvement, and rFVIIa was continued for an additional 16 doses with no further evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage noted. No toxicity or adverse events were reported.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^11139J91]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused by COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting all countries in the world. Bergamo, Italy, has been particularly afflicted by this pandemic, earning the unfortunate distinction of being the city with the highest mortality rate in the world. Fortunately, the peak phase has passed, and we are almost back to normality. While it is reassuring that new cases are decreasing and patient recovery rates are clearly increasing, it is concerning to witness unexpected medium-term complications.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^1128ZbiK]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research.

Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility.

The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included undergoing major surgery within the past 3 weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52), weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37), and having at least one of the following characteristics (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, and cardiopulmonary conditions.

### Reversal of oral factor Xa inhibitors by prothrombin complex concentrates: a re-appraisal [^116W5Ahh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Oral factor Xa inhibitors are an attractive class of anticoagulants expected to have broad application. Rapid and reliable reversal of the anticoagulant effect is important for patients with bleeding complications or those in need of urgent reversal for procedures. While no specific reversal agent is yet available, multiple published clinical guidelines suggest that four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) should be considered when urgent reversal is desired. This presentation updates prior reviews on this topic and summarizes more recent evidence in human studies indicating that four-factor PCCs available in North America do not reverse oral factor Xa-inhibitor anticoagulants. New agents on the horizon appear to be far more promising as therapies for reversal of oral factor Xa inhibitors.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115ge9wN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a significant advancement in the management of thromboembolic disease. Their ease of use, wide therapeutic window, and lack of monitoring requirements present solutions to the challenges posed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Studies at the time of writing validate their use in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment. However, efficacy and safety of NOACs in specific conditions — such as valvular heart disease, cancer-associated VTE, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), other hypercoagulable states, severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, pediatric patients, and pregnancy — remain undemonstrated.

- **Translational science perspective**: It is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of thrombosis in these conditions. Identifying factors playing a nodal role in these diseases would establish a theoretical basis for developing anticoagulation strategies specific to each condition, maximizing antithrombotic effects while minimizing hemorrhagic complications.

- **Clinical perspective**: Due to the complexity and challenges inherent in managing these diseases, well-designed randomized clinical trials are necessary for these specific patient populations. Until such data is available, traditional anticoagulation with VKAs or heparins will remain the cornerstone of therapy.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111xtKau]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is often a catastrophic clinical syndrome causing respiratory failure. Recognition of DAH often requires bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as symptoms are nonspecific. Hemoptysis is absent in up to one-third of patients, and radiographic imaging is also nonspecific and similar to other acute alveolar filling processes. Once the diagnosis is established, the underlying cause must be identified to initiate treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis of the underlying histologies and the clinical entities responsible for DAH, as well as treatment options.
