## Question

Perforated bowel treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of a perforated bowel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and sepsis control. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will classify the perforation by etiology, size, contamination, and patient physiology. After that, I need to decide operative versus nonoperative management and choose the surgical approach. Finally, I will outline procedure-specific strategies, postoperative care, special populations, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check each step against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: airway, breathing, circulation, and early sepsis management come before anything else, because delays in resuscitation worsen outcomes in hollow viscus perforation. I should administer 30 mL/kg crystalloids promptly and start vasopressors if hypotension persists after fluids, obtain two large-bore IV lines, draw labs including lactate, and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic organisms while arranging urgent surgical consultation and CT imaging when stable enough to travel [^113m3HKm] [^114PgrNU] [^112vRejW].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before jumping to conclusions: upright chest radiograph can rapidly detect free air, but CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the definitive modality to localize the perforation, quantify contamination, and classify severity. I should also remember that in suspected iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation, CT is more sensitive than plain films for detecting free air and can help triage to nonoperative care in selected cases [^112vRejW] [^112kr6Ks].

> I will now examine the classification framework because management hinges on it: etiology (diverticulitis, malignancy, Crohn's, ischemia, iatrogenic, foreign body, trauma), size and number of perforations, degree of contamination (localized vs purulent vs feculent), and patient physiology (stable vs sepsis vs septic shock) drive operative choices. I should double-check that Hinchey III denotes purulent and Hinchey IV feculent peritonitis in diverticulitis, and that free perforation in Crohn's disease mandates resection rather than simple closure due to high failure rates [^114De8FD] [^114n8GEQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nonoperative care. I need to ensure strict selection criteria: nonoperative management is reserved for hemodynamically stable patients with small, contained perforations, minimal contamination, and no peritonitis, ideally after good bowel preparation in iatrogenic cases, with close monitoring every 3–6 hours and immediate escalation if deterioration occurs. Failure rates are higher when conservative therapy is delayed, so I should set a low threshold to operate if there is no improvement within 24 hours [^112vRejW] [^116LDfWi] [^113vZcrW].

> Next, I should review operative indications and urgency: diffuse peritonitis, sepsis or septic shock, hemodynamic instability, large or multiple perforations, immunocompromised hosts, and failure of nonoperative management are clear triggers for urgent surgery. I need to check that guidelines emphasize early source control in septic patients and that damage control strategies are appropriate in unstable physiology [^114Rcbji] [^114fqqFS] [^111bzQqg].

> Let me consider the surgical approach carefully: laparoscopy is preferred when feasible for stable patients and experienced teams, but I should confirm that instability, massive contamination, or unclear anatomy mandate open laparotomy. For iatrogenic colon perforations, a laparoscopic-first approach is reasonable with conversion as needed, and for perforated peptic ulcer, minimally invasive repair is associated with fewer surgical site infections and less pain, though I must match technique to patient factors and local expertise [^113eJ83q] [^1129PN1V] [^115VBxWe].

> For small bowel perforation, I should verify whether primary repair versus resection is appropriate: small, single, clean perforations can be primarily repaired, whereas necrotic bowel, multiple contiguous perforations, mesenteric vascular injury, or malignancy require segmental resection. In Crohn's disease with free perforation, resection of the diseased segment is preferred over simple closure due to high leak rates, and in ischemia or severe contamination, delayed anastomosis or stoma may be safer [^112THwzs] [^114n8GEQ] [^113m3HKm].

> For colonic perforation, I need to ensure I tailor to etiology and contamination: in diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis, options include Hartmann's procedure, primary resection with anastomosis (with or without diversion), or laparoscopic lavage in selected centers, noting that lavage may reduce short-term morbidity but carries higher risks of persistent sepsis and reoperation. In feculent peritonitis, resection with end colostomy is often favored. For malignant perforations, oncologic resection with proximal control and consideration of subtotal colectomy is recommended. For iatrogenic perforations, primary repair is common when tissue is viable and contamination limited [^116DowZn] [^114fqqFS] [^11491Pm8] [^1129PN1V].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly unstable? I should double-check the role of damage control: in septic shock or severe physiological derangement, an abbreviated laparotomy with source control (stapled ends, lavage, temporary abdominal closure) and planned second look in 24–48 hours allows resuscitation and can reduce stoma rates and mortality compared with immediate complex reconstruction. Randomized and prospective data support this strategy in selected perforated diverticulitis patients [^111bzQqg] [^115Lf1nw] [^116wRndH].

> I need to ensure meticulous postoperative care: ICU monitoring for sepsis, hemodynamics, and respiratory status, continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with de-escalation based on cultures, early enteral nutrition when feasible, and structured stoma care. I should confirm that duration of antibiotics is typically 4–7 days, longer if infection persists, and that early mobilization and DVT prophylaxis are standard [^113m3HKm] [^114Rcbji].

> Let me reconsider special populations because thresholds and tactics shift: in Crohn's disease, free perforation requires resection rather than closure. In ulcerative colitis with toxic megacolon or impending perforation, urgent colectomy is indicated. In elderly or comorbid patients, I should have a lower threshold for staged procedures or damage control. In immunocompromised patients, nonoperative management often fails and early surgery is prudent. In bevacizumab-associated perforation, nonoperative care may be attempted selectively, but many still require operation and mortality is high [^114n8GEQ] [^116Q6BGx] [^112v13iH] [^111gP7kC].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision algorithm to keep this actionable: stabilize and resuscitate with early antibiotics and surgical consultation. Obtain CT to classify perforation. If stable with small, contained perforation and no peritonitis, trial nonoperative care with close monitoring. If unstable, with diffuse peritonitis, large or multiple perforations, or failure of conservative therapy, proceed to urgent surgery with laparoscopic-first when feasible. Choose procedure based on etiology, contamination, and physiology, escalating to damage control when unstable. Reassess at 24–48 hours for reconstruction or stoma reversal when appropriate [^114Rcbji] [^114fqqFS] [^1129PN1V].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed endoscopic options in iatrogenic perforations: in intraprocedural, stable patients with a clean perforation site, endoscopic closure with clips or suturing can be attempted, but urgent surgical consultation remains essential even after successful endoscopic repair, and patients unsuitable for endoscopic closure (unstable, immunosuppressed, delayed presentation with peritonitis) should go straight to surgery [^117AZajJ] [^113SfJLZ] [^111ZoUJj].

Perforated bowel is a surgical emergency requiring **immediate resuscitation** and **early source control** to prevent sepsis and death [^111LKQnH]. Management is tailored to etiology, contamination, and patient stability: small defects may be closed primarily [^112THwzs], while larger or contaminated perforations need resection with or without diversion [^111LKQnH]; unstable patients benefit from damage control [^111bzQqg]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential [^114PgrNU], and **laparoscopy is preferred** when feasible [^113eJ83q]. Nonoperative care is reserved for highly selected, stable patients with minimal contamination and close monitoring [^112vRejW] [^116LDfWi].

---

## Initial assessment and resuscitation

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and provide supplemental oxygen; intubate if respiratory failure or altered mental status [^notfound].

- **Circulation**: Establish two large-bore IV lines and initiate rapid isotonic crystalloid resuscitation (30 mL/kg) [^113m3HKm]; add vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine) if hypotension persists after fluids [^113m3HKm].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, lactate, coagulation profile, and type and crossmatch [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Obtain an urgent CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast to localize the perforation, assess contamination, and guide operative planning [^112vRejW].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for **hemodynamic instability**, **diffuse peritonitis**, **focal peritonitis with systemic signs**, or failure of nonoperative management. Nonoperative care is reserved for highly selected, stable patients with minimal contamination and close monitoring [^112vRejW] [^116LDfWi].

## Surgical techniques

Key options for small bowel and colonic perforation:

| **Aspect** | **Small bowel perforation** | **Colonic perforation** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary repair | For small, clean, stable patients with minimal contamination [^115Uyc89] | For small, clean, stable patients with minimal contamination [^1129PN1V] |
| Resection with primary anastomosis | For large, multiple, necrotic, or contaminated segments; primary anastomosis if viable, otherwise exteriorization or stoma [^113m3HKm] | For larger defects or localized contamination in stable patients [^111LKQnH] |
| Resection with end colostomy | For large, multiple, necrotic, or contaminated segments; primary anastomosis if viable, otherwise exteriorization or stoma [^113m3HKm] | For unstable patients, diffuse contamination, or poor tissue quality [^111LKQnH] |
| Laparoscopic approach or lavage | Preferred when feasible, with faster recovery and fewer wound complications [^notfound] | Controversial for Hinchey III diverticulitis; may be considered in selected centers [^116DowZn] |

---

## Role of laparoscopic surgery

Laparoscopy is increasingly used in stable patients, offering **reduced postoperative pain**, **shorter hospital stay**, and **fewer wound infections** compared with open surgery [^11431UaX]. Conversion to open is based on patient stability, tissue quality, and contamination [^113eJ83q].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Empiric **broad-spectrum antibiotics** should cover gram-negative and anaerobic organisms (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam or a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole) [^114PgrNU]. Duration is typically 4–7 days, tailored to clinical response and culture results [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative care and complications

- **Monitoring**: Frequent vital signs, urine output, and laboratory assessment for ongoing sepsis or leak [^116LDfWi].

- **Nutrition**: Early enteral feeding when feasible; parenteral nutrition if enteral not possible [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Anastomotic leak, wound infection, abscess, sepsis, and respiratory complications require prompt recognition and management [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of failure with nonoperative management; lower threshold for surgery [^11431UaX].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher morbidity and mortality; careful selection of operative strategy is essential [^112v13iH].

- **Bevacizumab-associated perforation**: High mortality; individualized management, often surgical [^111gP7kC].

---

Perforated bowel requires **rapid resuscitation** and **early source control**, with management individualized to etiology, contamination, and patient stability. Laparoscopy is preferred when feasible, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential; nonoperative care is reserved for carefully selected patients.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^1129PN1V]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Colonic closure, wedge resection, ostomy, and colonic resection are the main surgical options for ICP management. No RCTs have assessed the superiority of one method over the others. Thus, the therapeutic decision remains essentially empirical, based on the perforation characteristics (e.g. size, time of evolution, and degree of peritoneal contamination), the patient's general status (e.g. comorbidities), and the availability of adequate technology and surgical devices. Explorative laparoscopy is safe and should be considered the first line approach to assess the perforation-related damages. In patients with good bowel preparation, minimal peritoneal contamination, and adequate infection source control, the perforation repair can possibly be performed by laparoscopy and without drainage placement. Alternatively, staged repair or, in extreme cases, damage control surgery may be required.

The present WSES guidelines contribute to clarifying the complex decision-making process for the management of ICP. Despite the large number of publications, evidence is often derived from observational and moderate to low quality studies. However, it is scarcely feasible to design RCTs for an infrequent complication often requiring emergency treatment. Prospective registries would be highly advantageous to defining the validity of the present recommendations and proposed guidelines.

Small bowel perforation

In western countries, small bowel perforation is mainly due to unrecognized intestinal ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (i.e. complicated Crohn's disease) or post-traumatic. In other countries as Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Oceania small bowel perforation are more often caused by complication of infectious diseases (i.e. typhoid fever) causing a high mortality rate up to 60%.

The different causative events may impose differentiated treatment as complicated IBD generally require different management than infectious perforation. Multidisciplinary approach is necessary due to the often-multifactorial causative events (surgeon, ICU doctor, infectious disease specialist, gastroenterologist).

Class A patient may generally be treated with open or laparoscopic resection with primary anastomosis (whenever possible) and 3–5 days of antibiotics associated to the specific infectious disease treatment. Primary repair should be reserved only in selected patients with minimal peritoneal contamination and a small and single perforation (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6
Small bowel perforation adequate source control indications

Class B and class C patients must undergo surgery as soon as possible and delayed bowel anastomosis may be considered. Stoma creation or exteriorization of the perforation as a stoma (if distal to the Treitz ligament) should be considered as a valid alternative in the most severe cases. Antibiotic therapy should be continued up to the disappearing of ongoing infection signs.

In the event of severe hemodynamic instability and diffuse intra-abdominal infection, damage control procedure should be considered independently from the class of patient. Physiological restoring procedures should be associated to the surgical and pharmacological SC.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^1179ELE3]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Some authors have expressed their concerns with laparoscopic nonresectional treatment of perforated diverticulitis. They state that the decision to perform nonresectional surgery is influenced by the surgical access to the abdomen, i.e. laparoscopy, rather than based on evidence in the literature. Patients should undergo primary resection, whether the surgical access to the abdomen is conventional or laparoscopic, because there is "evidence" in the literature that resectional surgery leads to lower postoperative peritonitis, and mortality rates, compared with nonresectional surgery. Unfortunately, the evidence to which they referred — resection favoring nonresectional surgery — is equivocal or to the contrary as stated before. The major criticism of the nonresectional laparoscopically lavage technique is the continued presence of the perforated colon as a septic focus as well as the column of feces remaining in the colon proximally to the perforation as a potential ongoing source of contamination. This also was the main criticism toward the three-stage procedure that was used to treat PPD until the 1970s. Classen et al. had observed that postoperative mortality related to sepsis was lowered after addition of more effective antibiotics to treat gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria since 1970. Besides, PPD is accompanied by ileus, hence, it is not likely that the fecal column is propelled toward the perforation. A patent communication between the colonic lumen and the peritoneal cavity usually cannot be found during laparoscopy because the site of the original perforation has become sealed by the inflammatory process and omentum and seems efficient to control the source of contamination. If the perforation site is too large to be sealed before peristalsis resumes, resection of the bowel segment is advocated.

The suggestion that nonresectional surgery in combination with more advanced antibiotics have never proven to be an inferior strategy could explain the excellent results after laparoscopic lavage in combination with modern management of peritoneal sepsis with improved antibiotics and intensive care medicine. Naturally the latter technique has several advantages over the open three-stage procedure, of which less wound complications (such as infections and hernias), no stomal complications, and avoidance of a second operation are the most important. Nevertheless, because the evidence is weak, until now primary resection remains the standard treatment for PPD, although the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery Evidence-based Guidelines stated that laparoscopic nonresectional surgery may be considered in selected patients.

Materials and methods: expert panel and consensus conference organization

On September 2016, the President of the WSES (Luca Ansaloni) appointed five WSES members (Nicola de'Angelis, Fausto Catena, Federico Coccolini, Salomone Di Saverio, Massimo Sartelli) to establish the project committee and determine the organization of an international multidisciplinary expert panel deputed to develop the WSES Guidelines for the management of ICP. The project committee agreed to develop practice guidelines by formal consensus, which consists of formalizing the degree of agreement among experts by identifying and selecting, through ratings and feedback, the points on which the experts agree and the points on which they disagree or are undecided. Additionally, it involves drafting a small number of concise and unambiguous recommendations that address the questions asked.

Briefly, the development of the WSES guidelines was structured upon two phases: the synthesis of the literature and the consensus conference. For phase I, the project committee identified 17 key questions regarding ICP risk, diagnosis, and treatments that would guide the literature search (Table 1). Then, an expert panel composed of surgeons, endoscopists, gastroenterologists, and anesthesiologists from five continents was invited to participate and answer the selected questions. The experts who agreed to participate (n = 50) were divided into 17 groups of at least 3 experts each who were asked to answer one of the selected key questions regarding ICP. For each group, a group leader was nominated; the group leader was responsible for coordinating the work of the experts in his/her group, providing a summary document that aligned the group's agreement upon answers to the specific question assigned, and meeting the assigned deadline. Experts were solicited to search the literature using a systematic approach within different databases (e.g. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus) and assess the level of evidence and the grade of the recommendation based on the recommendations of Guyatt et al. (Table 2). For the literature search, the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: management of colonic/colon perforations, repair of iatrogenic large bowel perforations, abdominal imaging in colonic perforations, evolution of imaging, colonic perforation complications/outcomes, endoscopic treatment of colonic perforations, and peritonitis after colonoscopy.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: what you need to know [^1116xjhD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite therapeutic advancements and the significant efficacy of medical management, peptic ulcer disease still affects millions of people. Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches.

### Treatment dilemma for survivors of rituximab-induced bowel perforation in the setting of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder [^1157RPxc]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a recognised complication of solid and haematopoietic stem cell transplant. It consists of a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms that arises secondary to post-transplant immunosuppression. Although there is no definite standard of care for the optimal treatment for PTLD, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, with and/or without chemotherapy (usually CHOP = cytoxan, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) has become a routine part of the treatment of any CD20 (+) PTLD, with response rates similar to chemotherapy with decreased toxicity. A rare and often lethal, complication of rituximab therapy for PTLD is bowel perforation secondary to tumour lysis of lymphoma involving the intestine. A small number of cases of bowel perforation have been reported, with very few documented survivors. The risk for recurrent perforation in the setting of ongoing rituximab treatment is unknown. There is sparse data supporting how to best treat the survivors.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^115HiQBK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

This position paper updates the literature related to the management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with the goals of identifying a) key management decisions, b) alternative management options and c) gaps in our knowledge base that can be targeted in a future emergency surgery research agenda. From this we have created a decision making algorithm that can be modified based on evolving evidence and local resources to guide institutional practices. This manuscript will provide the basis for a future evidence based guideline (EBG) that will be developed and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery and published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery. We envision that the EBG recommendations will be graded based on the level of evidence and will identify the resources needed to provide optimal care. Recognizing the tremendous variability in hospital resources available worldwide, this optimal resource information will be used to designate levels of acute care surgery hospitals (similar to trauma centers). This designation process will be used to leverage hospitals to upgrade their resources to optimize their emergency surgery capabilities.

### Functional outcomes of emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis, hinchey grade III [^116FGmbu]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the long term, patients treated by emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis continue to experience distress from bowel dysfunction regardless of bowel continuity or permanent stoma. We suggest that patients who have undergone emergency surgery due to perforated diverticulitis should be offered regular follow-ups regardless of the surgical technique used to diagnose and offer treatment for functional disorders.

4) Free perforation

Recommendation

We recommend performing surgical exploration in the presence of radiological signs of pneumoperitoneum and free fluid within the peritoneal cavity in acutely unwell patients presenting with complicated Crohn's disease or acute severe ulcerative colitis (strong recommendation based on low-level evidence 1C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Free peritoneal perforation in inflammatory bowel disease is a rare condition, with few cases reported in the literature. It occurs in 1–3% of Crohn's disease patients as a first manifestation or in the course of the disease, and it is more frequent in severe acute ulcerative colitis. Perforation is considered a serious and potentially life-threatening event and is one of the main indications for emergency surgical intervention. Free perforation is the indication for surgery in up to 16% of the cases of complicated IBD. The site of perforation is usually located in the colon in cases of UC, while patients with CD can present with perforation of either the small or large bowel. Free perforation is an absolute indication for emergency surgery, even though the evidence available in the literature is scarce, but delayed surgery is correlated with high mortality and morbidity in patients with IBD.

### Which factors predict bowel complications in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer being treated with bevacizumab? [^111gP7kC]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Increased rates of bowel perforation in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treated with bevacizumab have been reported, but the risk factors for this association are uncertain. We sought to identify factors associated with bowel perforation and fistula formation in recurrent EOC patients treated with bevacizumab.

Methods

A chart review of all patients treated with bevacizumab for recurrent EOC at a single institution was performed. Pertinent patient characteristics and treatment information were collected. Univariate logistic regression was performed to analyze multiple variables.

Results

One hundred twelve patients who were treated with 160 different bevacizumab regimens were identified. The median age was 60 years (range, 29–78 years). Patients had received a median of 4 prior chemotherapy regimens (range, 1–10). The median number of cycles was 4 (range, 0.5–31). Ten patients (9%) were diagnosed with bowel perforations, and another 2 patients (1.8%) were diagnosed with fistulas. The 30-day mortality following perforation was 50%, with 30% of patients dying within 1 week. Patients with rectovaginal nodularity were more likely to develop a bowel perforation or fistula than those who did not have this finding, OR = 3.64 (95% CI = 1.1 to 12.1, p = 0.04). None of the other variables were significantly associated with bowel perforations or fistula formation.

Conclusions

Rectovaginal nodularity is associated with an increased risk of bowel perforation or fistula formation for patients with recurrent EOC treated with bevacizumab. Careful consideration should be given prior to initiating bevacizumab treatment in EOC patients with rectovaginal nodularity since the mortality rate with bevacizumab associated bowel perforations is 50%.

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^113m3HKm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

In patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock prompt administration of 30 mL/kg intravenous crystalloid fluid. If blood pressure is not restored after initial fluid resuscitation vasopressors should be commenced.

Open or laparoscopic small bowel segmental resection and primary anastomosis.
In the setting of perforation due to small bowel ischemia, resection and delayed anastomoses at a second look are usually needed. Also, open or endovascular mesenteric vessel reconstruction may be needed.
Open or laparoscopic resection and stoma creation or exteriorization of the perforation as a stoma (critically ill patients or severe inflammation and edema of the bowel, resulting in friable tissue which precludes anastomosis).
In the setting of typhoidal perforation, although closure in two layers of single perforation with relatively healthy tissue after refreshment of the edge seems an acceptable option, resection of the unhealthy tissue segment with primary anastomosis of healthy edges about 10 cm on each side of the perforation is recommended.

+

Antibiotic therapy for 4 days (immunocompetent and stable patients) (more days if there are signs of ongoing infection).

There are many methods of surgical treatment of small bowel perforation, including wedge resection and closure, resection and primary anastomosis, and exteriorization of the perforation as a stoma. Primary repair is only rarely an option, in the occasional patient with minimal peritoneal contamination of the peritoneal cavity and a small puncture hole.

In delayed cases with diffuse peritonitis, there can be severe inflammation and edema of the bowel, resulting in friable tissue which precludes anastomosis after resection, and therefore, an ileostomy should be performed as a life saving measure.

Damage control surgery can be an alternative option deferring the definitive surgical management via anastomosis.

Laparoscopic management of small bowel perforations has been reported, but there are no comparative studies with open surgery. In Table 12, the clinical pathway for patients with acute diverticulitis is illustrated.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: a review [^111odL8U]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Perforated peptic ulcer disease (PUD) affects 4 million people annually worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5% to 10%. Of those affected, 5% will progress to the point of perforation. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, perforated PUD continues to have a high rate of morbidity (48.5%) and mortality (9.3%). This review summarizes the current evidence on management of perforated PUD, including management of failed repairs.

Observations

Approaches for repair include primary closure and omental patch closure. Omental patch may be most useful in large perforations with friable tissue. Minimally invasive surgery is the preferred approach in perforated PUD, with improved outcomes compared with open techniques. Leak from the ulcer after repair is seen in approximately 12% to 17% of cases. Approaches to releak include expectant management, radiologic and/or endoscopic intervention, and repeat surgery. Morbidity and mortality after releak are especially high, and complete healing of the leak may take time.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite advances in medical management and surgical techniques, perforated PUD continues to have a relatively high rate of morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive surgery is the current preferred treatment approach.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^116mbsmf]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Perforated peptic ulcer is a common emergency condition worldwide, with associated mortality rates of up to 30%. A scarcity of high-quality studies about the condition limits the knowledge base for clinical decision making, but a few published randomised trials are available. Although Helicobacter pylori and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are common causes, demographic differences in age, sex, perforation location, and underlying causes exist between countries, and mortality rates also vary. Clinical prediction rules are used, but accuracy varies with study population. Early surgery, either by laparoscopic or open repair, and proper sepsis management are essential for good outcome. Selected patients can be managed non-operatively or with novel endoscopic approaches, but validation of such methods in trials is needed. Quality of care, sepsis care bundles, and postoperative monitoring need further assessment. Adequate trials with low risk of bias are urgently needed to provide better evidence. We summarise the evidence for perforated peptic ulcer management and identify directions for future clinical research.

Perforated peptic ulcers (PPU) represent a critical surgical emergency. Despite the historical predominance of open surgical repair, laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches have shown promise in reducing morbidity and hospital stay. This study aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis comparing open, laparoscopic, and endoscopic interventions for PPU repair.

Methods

A systematic search of Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these approaches. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and morbidity.

Results

Eight RCTs including 657 patients were analyzed. Endoscopic interventions were associated with fewer respiratory complications and shorter hospital stays, while the laparoscopic approach demonstrated fewer surgical site infections and less postoperative pain compared to open repair. Other outcomes demonstrated non-significant differences across interventions.

Conclusions

Prompt resuscitation and surgical repair, either laparoscopic or open, remains the gold standard for PPU. Endoscopic techniques are viable alternatives for small perforations and in selected cases where general anesthesia is contraindicated.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^115rpKU9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation (ICP) is a severe complication that can occur during both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although 45–60% of ICPs are diagnosed by the endoscopist while performing the colonoscopy, many ICPs are not immediately recognized but are instead suspected on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms that occur after the endoscopic procedure. There are three main therapeutic options for ICPs: endoscopic repair, conservative therapy, and surgery. The therapeutic approach must vary based on the setting of the diagnosis (intra- or post-colonoscopy), the type of ICP, the characteristics and general status of the patient, the operator's level of experience, and surgical device availability. Although ICPs have been the focus of numerous publications, no guidelines have been created to standardize the management of ICPs. The aim of this article is to present the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for the management of ICP, which are intended to be used as a tool to promote global standards of care in case of ICP. These guidelines are not meant to substitute providers' clinical judgment for individual patients, and they may need to be modified based on the medical team's level of experience and the availability of local resources.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^114aTnaE]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

The paucity in clinical progress and basic understanding of perforated peptic ulcers begs for increased attention in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Compared to the toll on human health worldwide, there is poor understanding of the pathophysiology underlying perforation, the ability to self-heal and the development of the sepsis syndrome in these patients.

Identification of prognostic factors and pathways of care that may enhance recovery, reduce morbidity and potentially also reduce mortality should be further investigated. Novel techniques may be further explored to seek alternatives to invasive surgical repair. Similarly, some patients with minimal symptoms may also benefit from less invasive therapeutic approaches. However, groups should be investigated in prospective protocols and trials dedicated to find the safest and most efficacious management strategies and the appropriate criteria for selection. Long-term follow up studies with evaluation of quality of life are needed.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^114kX2jQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In 1945 Florey was responsible for the development of penicillin for use as a medicine. Since then antibiotics were more frequently used during colonic surgery. Partly, this led toward a shift in the continuing controversy between three- and two-staged operations in favor of primary resection of the involved colon. Although at that time Smithwick, amongst others, still recommended the three-stage and initially nonresectional operation, more publications advocating primary resection in case of PPD arose. Initial improvement after colostomy and drainage, without resection, often was followed by severe deterioration several days later when the involved perforated bowel was left in situ.

Since the 1960s, combinations of antibiotics were used against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. Combination antibacterial therapy had shown better survival in septic patients. Unfortunately, mortality rates in patients with PPD remained high. The basic cause of this high mortality was that the source of infection remained in the peritoneal cavity. Painter and Burkitt documented the increased intraluminal pressures and muscle abnormalities as the cause for diverticula formation in the sigmoid. When left in situ, the perforated segment remains a source of sepsis as bowel contractions continue evacuating infective material. Clinical observations and this new understanding of pathophysiology of diverticulitis led to the conviction that the colonic perforation had to be removed primarily. Nevertheless, controversy persisted because the "evidence" was only based on expert opinion and some (small) noncomparative case series.

### A case of bowel perforation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer [^1161qTQZ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bowel perforation is a rare complication of chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer, and may result from tumor necrosis within involved bowel or as a function of the mechanism of the chemotherapeutic agent itself.

Case

We present a case of a 71-year-old woman who experienced a spontaneous bowel perforation after a single cycle of carboplatin and paclitaxel during neoadjuvant treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of a gastrointestinal perforation with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. The clinical circumstances were highly suggestive of a tumor lysis mechanism for the perforation.

Conclusion

Bowel perforation can occur as a direct consequence of cytotoxic neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. This potential serious complication may be worthy of consideration when deciding between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary surgical management.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115Uyc89]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with small bowel perforations (Recommendation 1B).

In the event of small perforations, primary repair is recommended (Recommendation 1B).

There are many methods of surgical treatment of small bowel perforation, including primary closure, excision and closure, resection and primary anastomosis, limited right hemicolectomy, and stoma creation. Primary repair should be performed for patients with minor symptoms and with perioperative findings of minimal peritoneal contamination of the peritoneal cavity. In the setting of typhoidal perforation, although closure in two layers of single perforation with relatively healthy tissue after refreshment of the edge seems an acceptable option, resection of the unhealthy tissue segment with primary anastomosis of healthy edges about 10 cm on each side of the perforation is recommended.

In delayed cases with diffuse peritonitis, there can be severe inflammation and oedema of the bowel, resulting in friable tissue which precludes anastomosis, and therefore, an ileostomy should be performed as a life saving measure. Laparoscopic management of small bowel perforations was reported, but there was no comparative study with open surgery.

Other infections that may rarely cause small bowel perforation in immuno-compromised patients include amoebic infection, Clostridium difficile, Cytomegalovirus, and Histoplasmosis. Rarely, medications (NSAIDs, potassium chloride, and steroids), cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy may lead to small bowel perforation.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^112kr6Ks]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

ᅟ

Obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer represent challenging matters in terms of diagnosis, life-saving strategies, obstruction resolution and oncologic challenge. The aims of the current paper are to update the previous WSES guidelines for the management of large bowel perforation and obstructive left colon carcinoma (OLCC) and to develop new guidelines on obstructive right colon carcinoma (ORCC).

Methods

The literature was extensively queried for focused publication until December 2017. Precise analysis and grading of the literature has been performed by a working group formed by a pool of experts: the statements and literature review were presented, discussed and voted at the Consensus Conference of the 4th Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) held in Campinas in May 2017.

Results

CT scan is the best imaging technique to evaluate large bowel obstruction and perforation. For OLCC, self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS), when available, offers interesting advantages as compared to emergency surgery; however, the positioning of SEMS for surgically treatable causes carries some long-term oncologic disadvantages, which are still under analysis. In the context of emergency surgery, resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) is preferable to Hartmann's procedure, whenever the characteristics of the patient and the surgeon are permissive. Right-sided loop colostomy is preferable in rectal cancer, when preoperative therapies are predicted. With regards to the treatment of ORCC, right colectomy represents the procedure of choice; alternatives, such as internal bypass and loop ileostomy, are of limited value. Clinical scenarios in the case of perforation might be dramatic, especially in case of free faecal peritonitis. The importance of an appropriate balance between life-saving surgical procedures and respect of oncologic caveats must be stressed. In selected cases, a damage control approach may be required. Medical treatments including appropriate fluid resuscitation, early antibiotic treatment and management of co-existing medical conditions according to international guidelines must be delivered to all patients at presentation.

Conclusions

The current guidelines offer an extensive overview of available evidence and a qualitative consensus regarding management of large bowel obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer.

### Small bowel and colon perforation [^116NQDGF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

For patients with small bowel and colonic perforations, a definitive diagnosis of the cause of perforation is not necessary before operation. Bowel obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease are the most common causes of nontraumatic intestinal perforations in industrialized countries, whereas infectious causes of intestinal perforations are more common in developing countries. Treatment of small bowel and colonic perforations generally includes intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, but the specific management of the bowel depends on the underlying cause of the perforation.

4.8.2 Medical therapy

In the first instance, patient optimisation is required when localised perforation in Crohn's disease has led to abscess formation. Surgical intervention is mandatory within the context of free peritonitis and highly likely to be required at some stage in the setting of localised abscess formation. Ideally, surgery takes place following treatment of sepsis and treatment of nutritional deficiencies. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be an effective means of controlling intestinal inflammation without use of corticosteroids.

Good Practice Recommendation 10. Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting of non-perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, joint medical and surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection is not always necessary (Agreement: 100%).

Some observers suggest that surgery may be avoided by percutaneous radiological drainage of abscesses and then resumption of medical therapy. The largest case series to date of 51 patients identified retrospectively from review of medical charts from a single centre over a 10-year period has shown that patients undergoing surgical resection were significantly less likely to develop abscess recurrence than those treated with antibiotics alone or percutaneous drainage over a mean follow-up of 3.75 years (12% vs 56%). Nevertheless, non-surgical approaches were successful in preventing subsequent surgery in almost half of the patients treated medically. An almost identical proportion of patients avoided surgery over long-term follow-up in a different series of 32 patients managed with percutaneous drainage for perforating Crohn's disease. This strategy, if successful in treating sepsis, is likely to lead to lower morbidity and potentially lower stoma rates.

### Endoscopic management of colonic perforations [^112LAg8E]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We will review the current management of colonic perforations, with particular emphasis on iatrogenic perforations caused by colonoscopy, the leading etiology. We will focus on recently developed endoscopic techniques and technologies that obviate morbid emergency surgery (the standard management approach in years past).

Recent Findings

Colonic perforations are rare but potentially fatal complications of both diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopy resulting in death in approximately 5% of cases with the mortality increasing with delay in diagnosis and treatment. As novel endoscopic techniques and tools have flourished in recent years, our approach to management of these perforations has evolved. With the availability of newer tools such as over the scope clips, enhanced through the scope clips and novel endoscopic suturing devices, colonic perforations can be managed effectively in many or most patients without the morbidity of surgical interventions.

Summary

With expanding use of colonoscopy, inadvertent outcomes such as perforations are bound to increase as well. Early diagnosis permits minimally invasive, nonsurgical, endoscopic management in most cases if the expertise and tools are available. Centers with high colonoscopy volumes including therapeutic procedures would be well served to invest in the requisite technologies and expertise.

Penetrating Crohn's disease — free perforation management and epidemiology: Patients with a free perforation should undergo surgical resection of the perforated segment (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Free perforation of the bowel in patients with CD is uncommon with a reported incidence of 1.5% to 16% with nearly all cases involving a solitary perforation of the small bowel, and resection of the perforated segment is preferred over simple suture closure because of the relatively high failure rate and increased risk of morbidity associated with primary repair.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^113Uzunp]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

During the last century, mortality rates after emergency surgery for PPD have remained high: nearly 20%. Progress in (antibiotic) sepsis management has led to more radical surgical procedures, but survival did not improve significantly. The reason for this remains unclear. The question arises whether "old-fashioned" (laparoscopic) nonresectional surgery in combination with "modern" sepsis management is the key to success. The last reports are promising.

In our personal opinion, supported by the existing literature about treatment of PPD, resection with PA should be the standard procedure in the emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis. HP must seriously be considered the surgical procedure of choice for older patients with multiple comorbidities, realizing that restoration of bowel continuity is not an issue. Laparoscopic nonresectional surgery is regarded as a good alternative in case of purulent peritonitis, provided that it is performed by a surgeon who is experienced in laparoscopic surgery. Although currently, percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses is the preferred treatment strategy in contained diverticular perforations, it is not likely that nonresectional interventional radiographic techniques will play a prominent role in the initial treatment of PPD in the near future. Clearly, more (prospective randomized) research is warranted to confirm all of these statements.

Small bowel perforations

Jejunoileal perforations are a relatively uncommon source of peritonitis in Western countries compared to less developed regions where such intestinal perforations are a frequent contributor to high morbidity and mortality rates.

Although prompt surgery correlates with better clinical outcomes, there is widespread disagreement among the medical community regarding the proper surgical course of action; surgeons advocate a wide array of procedures, including simple closure, wedge excision or segmental resection and anastomosis, ileostomy, and side-to-side ileo-transverse anastomosis following primary perforation repair.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with small bowel perforations (Recommendation 1A).

In the event of small perforations, primary repair is recommended. However, when resection is required, subsequent anastomosis has not been shown to reduce post-operative morbidity and mortality rates. (Recommendation 2B).

Further, only treatment centers with surgeons who are experienced in laparoscopic procedures should utilize the laparoscopic approach (Recommendation 2C).

Primary repair of perforated bowels is preferable to resection and anastomosis due to lower complication rates, although it should be noted that the optimal outcome in these cases may be attributable to the limited tissue injury of minor perforations.

Patients with malignant lesions, necrotic bowels, perforations associated with mesenteric vascular injuries, or multiple contiguous perforations should not undergo primary repair.

During resection, the entire diseased segment is excised, leaving healthy, well perfused ends for anastomosis. The technique used for the enteroenterostomy (stapled or hand-sewn) seems to have little impact on the anastomotic complication rate.

Primary bowel anastomosis must be approached cautiously in the presence of gross purulent or feculent peritonitis due to high rates of serious complications.

Colonic perforation following colonoscopy

Early detection and prompt treatment are essential in optimizing the treatment of colonic post-colonoscopy perforations. Patients presenting with such perforations should undergo immediate surgical intervention, which typically involves primary repair or resection (Recommendation 1B).

Recently, the frequency of colonic perforation has increased due to routinely performed advanced therapeutic endoscopy.

Over the last decade, many advancements have been streamlined to better address these perforations, yet there are no definitive guidelines for their optimal management.

Choosing a conservative or surgical approach depends on a variety of clinical factors.

Conservative management is typically used to treat patients in stable clinical condition without any signs of peritonitis. In published literature, fewer than 20% of patients with colonoscopy-related perforations were successfully treated with a non-surgical approach.

Although select patients may be responsive to non-operative therapy, most cases warrant prompt surgical intervention to minimize the extent of intraperitoneal contamination, thereby facilitating a single-step procedure that will likely reduce post-operative complications.

Further, timely intervention (shortened timeframe between perforation and treatment) results in improved patient outcome.

An early laparoscopic approach is a safe and effective treatment for colonoscopy-related colonic perforation (Recommendation 1C).

Laparoscopic surgery is a prudent compromise that minimizes the risks of invasive surgery as well as those of insufficiently aggressive non-operative therapy.

If the area of perforation cannot be localized laparoscopically, the surgeon should begin with a laparotomy before proceeding further.

### Simple closure of perforated peptic ulcer… [^116FqTDz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Sixty patients underwent simple closure of a perforated peptic ulcer. For 56 patients, average delay in treatment was 21. 6 hours. Postoperatively, 21 patients had either pulmonary or abdominal complications. Ten patients died. Acute onset of ulcer symptoms prior to perforation was associated with a threefold increase in mortality compared with patients with chronic symptoms. Seven patients subsequently underwent vagotomy and partial gastrectomy without complications. This study demonstrates that in patients with peptic ulcer disease, perforation is an unusually frequent indication for operation; advanced age, treatment delay of 30 hours or more, and acute ulcer symptoms are associated with increased morbidity and mortality; and simple closure of the perforation remains an effective procedure in patients who have delayed seeking treatment.

Laparoscopic vs. open surgery for emergent cases

A relatively more recent trend in surgical research has been questioning the appropriateness of laparoscopic sigmoid resections in emergent diverticulitis cases, as opposed to the traditional open operation. Retrospective reviews have been promising in favor of the laparoscopic approach, though these (despite attempts at propensity scoring) still suffer from the selection bias of older and more comorbid patients receiving open operations, and intention-to-treat analyses despite high conversion rates to open procedures. No RCT has yet been performed on this topic.

Damage control surgery (DCS)

DCS is a well-established strategy, typically implemented in the setting of severe traumatic intraabdominal injuries when the patient is physiologically decompensating. There is some evidence that supports the use of this surgical strategy in non-traumatic surgical emergencies, such as perforated acute diverticulitis. DCS includes an abbreviated source-control laparotomy with a vacuum-assisted temporary abdominal closure device, followed by transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for resuscitation, with or without second-look laparotomy, and delayed definitive surgical repair. A systematic review of 8 trials (7 retrospective and 1 prospective) between 2006 and 2018 evaluated the indications for and outcomes related to DCS for perforated acute diverticulitis. They found that patients treated with DCS had a lower percentage of overall morbidity, 30-day mortality, and definitive ostomy compared to those treated with Hartman's procedure. Based on the 2016 WSES Guidelines, DCS remains an effective surgical strategy in critically ill patients affected by sepsis/septic shock and hemodynamic instability. RCTs are needed to refine the indications and techniques of DCS for patients with perforated acute diverticulitis.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^1172vzg2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Small bowel perforations

Small bowel perforations are a less common source of peritonitis in the Western countries than the Eastern ones. Most small intestinal perforations are due to unrecognized intestinal ischemia. Treatment is most commonly resection of the involved segment. Small bowel obstruction has previously been considered a relative contraindication for laparoscopic management. A literature search of the Medline database by Ghosheh et al. defined the outcome of laparoscopy for acute small bowel obstruction. Nineteen studies from between 1994 and 2005 were identified. The most common etiologies of obstruction were adhesions (83.2%), abdominal wall hernia (3.1%), malignancy (2.9%), internal hernia (1.9%), and bezoars (0.8%). Laparoscopic treatment was possible in 705 cases with a conversion rate to open surgery of 33.5%. Causes of conversion were dense adhesions (27.7%), the need for bowel resection (23.1%), unidentified etiology (13.0%), iatrogenic injury (10.2%), malignancy (7.4%), inadequate visualization (4.2%), hernia (3.2%), and other causes (11.1%). Morbidity was 15.5% (152/981) and mortality was 1.5% (16/1046). There were 45 reported recognized intraoperative enterotomies (6.5%), but less than half resulted in conversion. The Authors concluded that laparoscopy was an effective procedure for the treatment of acute small bowel obstruction with acceptable risk of morbidity and early recurrence

### Laparoscopic lavage versus primary resection for acute perforated diverticulitis: review and meta-analysis [^116DowZn]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clinical outcomes after laparoscopic lavage (LL) or colonic resection (CR) for purulent diverticulitis.

Background

Laparoscopic lavage has been suggested as an alternative treatment for traditional CR. Comparative studies to date have shown conflicting results.

Methods

Electronic searches of Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were performed. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for effect size of continuous variables and pooled odds ratios (POR) calculated for discrete variables.

Results

A total of 589 patients recruited from 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 comparative studies were included; 85% as Hinchey III. LL group had younger patients with higher body mass index and lower ASA grades, but comparable Hinchey classification and previous diverticulitis rates. No significant differences were noted for mortality, 30-day reoperations and unplanned readmissions. LL had higher rates of intraabdominal abscesses (POR = 2.85; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.52–5.34; P = 0.001), peritonitis (POR = 7.80; 95% CI 2.12–28.69; P = 0.002), and increased long-term emergency reoperations (POR = 3.32; 95% CI 1.73–6.38; P < 0.001). Benefits of LL included shorter operative time, fewer cardiac complications, fewer wound infections, and shorter hospital stay. Overall, 90% had stomas after CR, of whom 74% underwent stoma reversal within 12-months. Approximately, 14% of LL patients required a stoma; 48% obtaining gut continuity within 12-months, whereas 36% underwent elective sigmoidectomy.

Conclusions

The preservation of diseased bowel by LL is associated with approximately 3 times greater risk of persistent peritonitis, intraabdominal abscesses and the need for emergency surgery compared with CR. Future studies should focus on developing composite predictive scores encompassing the wide variation in presentations of diverticulitis and treatment tailored on case-by-case basis.

### Incidence and management of gastrointestinal perforation from bevacizumab in advanced cancers [^111mL2KM]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Bevacizumab (Avastin™, Genentech) is a monoclonal antibody that deactivates the vascular endothelial growth factor leading to disruption of vital cancer signaling pathways and inhibition of angiogenesis which results in its anti-tumor activity. The use of bevacizumab in treating cancers has steadily increased since it was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic colorectal cancer. Clinical trials have revealed that bevacizumab has serious side effects, including spontaneous bowel perforation, which can occur in patients who have no involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by cancer. Although risk factors for bevacizumab-associated bowel perforation have been identified, it is still unclear which patients are specifically at risk for this complication. The management of bevacizumab-induced bowel perforation depends on the clinical presentation and the goals of care set by the treating physicians and the patient.

10. 1001/jamasurg.
2024. 6724 Importance. Perforated peptic ulcer disease affects 4 million people annually worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5% to 10%. Of those affected, 5% will progress to the point of perforation. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, perforated PUD continues to have a high rate of morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the current evidence on management of perforated PUD, including management of failed repairs. Observations Approaches for repair include primary closure and omental patch closure. Omental patch may be most useful in large perforations with friable tissue. Minimally invasive surgery is the preferred approach in perforated PUD, with improved outcomes compared with open techniques. Leak from the ulcer after repair is seen in approximately 12% to 17% of cases.

Approaches to releak include expectant management, radiologic and/or endoscopic intervention, and repeat surgery. Morbidity and mortality after releak are especially high, and complete healing of the leak may take time. Conclusions and Relevance Despite advances in medical management and surgical techniques, perforated PUD continues to have a relatively high rate of morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive surgery is the current preferred treatment approach. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Clinical features and outcomes of bowel perforation in primary pediatric gastrointestinal lymphoma [^111UceoV]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary malignancies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are the most common tumors and are responsible for more than 20% of cancer deaths worldwide but represent less than 5% of all pediatric neoplasms. In contrast to the pattern in adulthood, in which colorectal and gastric cancer rank first and second, lymphoma is the most common GI tract malignancy in childhood, with frequent intestinal involvement. Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGL) mainly involves GI lesions with or without expansion to regional lymph nodes, the spleen, or the liver, according to most studies.

The main type of primary pediatric gastrointestinal lymphoma (PPGL) is non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and its primary treatment is chemotherapy combined with surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or antibiotics when necessary. Bowel perforation is a clinical presentation of patients with PGL. It is also a life-threatening complication during chemotherapy that occurs in 9% of patients with PGL. There have been some reports on the prevention, clinical features, and histopathological features of PGL with bowel perforation in adults. Due to the rarity of PPGL, few studies have been conducted on bowel perforation in PPGL. Moreover, there have been no reports on the prognosis after surgery for PGL with perforation, although surgery is generally considered the primary treatment for bowel perforation. Therefore, this study reported the experience of diagnosis and treatment of bowel perforation before and during chemotherapy for PPGL at a single center and evaluated the effect of surgery on prognosis.

### Laparoscopic lavage is feasible and safe for the treatment of perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis: the first results from the randomized controlled trial DILALA [^112PpAuR]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate short-term outcomes of a new treatment for perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis in a randomized controlled trial.

Background

Perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis (Hinchey III) has traditionally been treated with surgery including colon resection and stoma (Hartmann procedure) with considerable postoperative morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic lavage has been suggested as a less invasive surgical treatment.

Methods

Laparoscopic lavage was compared with colon resection and stoma in a randomized controlled multicenter trial, DILALA (ISRCTN82208287). Initial diagnostic laparoscopy showing Hinchey III was followed by randomization. Clinical data was collected up to 12 weeks postoperatively.

Results

Eighty-three patients were randomized, out of whom 39 patients in laparoscopic lavage and 36 patients in the Hartmann procedure groups were available for analysis. Morbidity and mortality after laparoscopic lavage did not differ when compared with the Hartmann procedure. Laparoscopic lavage resulted in shorter operating time, shorter time in the recovery unit, and shorter hospital stay.

Conclusions

In this trial, laparoscopic lavage as treatment for patients with perforated diverticulitis Hinchey III was feasible and safe in the short-term.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^112iiQK6]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The supposed optimal treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis has changed several times during the last century, but at present is still unclear.

Methods/results

The first cases of complicated perforated diverticulitis of the colon were reported in the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time the first therapeutic guidelines were postulated in which an initial nonresectional procedure was provided to be the safest plan of management. After many years in which resection had become standard practice, today, one century later, again (laparoscopic) nonresectional surgery is presented as a safe and promising alternative in treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis. The question rises what had happened to close the circle?

Conclusions

This paper includes a historic summary of changing patterns in surgical strategies in perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^112vRejW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Statement 4

4.1. After diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopies, all patients who present with abdominal pain, and/or tenderness, and/or abdominal distension, and/or fever, and/or rectal bleeding should be investigated for ICP by laboratory tests and imaging exams (Recommendation Grade 1B).
4.2. The minimum biochemical markers that should be requested in the case of suspected ICP are white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (Recommendation Grade 1C).
4.3. ICP should be confirmed with the demonstration of free intra-peritoneal or extra-peritoneal air (Recommendation 1B). CT scan is more sensitive than standard abdominal radiographs to detect free air (Recommendation Grade 1C).
4.4. In the case of localized peritoneal signs, double contrast enhanced CT scan can be a useful adjunctive tool to confirm the feasibility of non-operative management of ICP (Recommendation Grade 1C).

Conservative and endoscopic treatments for ICP

Which are the indications for conservative treatment or an immediate surgical intervention after an ICP diagnosis?

Once the diagnosis of perforation is confirmed by clinical and radiological examinations, the decision between surgical and non-operative treatments will depend on the type of injury, the quality of the bowel preparation, the underlying colonic pathology, and the clinical stability of the patient. However, a surgical consultation should be obtained in all cases of perforation.

Whenever the risk of a large perforation is present and the patient presents with signs and symptoms of peritonitis, the emergency surgery approach is reasonable and safe. Surgical management is also recommended in patients with concomitant colonic diseases requiring surgery, transplanted patients, and immunosuppressed patients. In selected patients with localized pain, free air without diffuse free fluids in radiographs, hemodynamic stability, and an absence of fever, non-operative management (conservative) may be appropriate and is associated with low morbidity, low mortality, and short hospital stays. Conservative management is usually suitable for small, sealed-off perforations that occurred during a therapeutic colonoscopy in patients with an optimal bowel preparation.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^114De8FD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last three decades, emergency surgery for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis has evolved dramatically but remains controversial. Diverticulitis is categorized as uncomplicated (amenable to outpatient treatment) versus complicated (requiring hospitalization). Patients with complicated diverticulitis undergo computerized tomography (CT) scanning and the CT findings are used categorize the severity of disease. Treatment of stage I (phlegmon with or without small abscess) and stage II (phlegmon with large abscess) diverticulitis (which includes bowel rest, intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage (PCD) of the larger abscesses) has not changed much over last two decades. On the other hand, treatment of stage III (purulent peritonitis) and stage IV (feculent peritonitis) diverticulitis has evolved dramatically and remains morbid. In the 1980s a two stage procedure (1st - segmental sigmoid resection with end colostomy and 2nd - colostomy closure after three to six months) was standard of care for most general surgeons. However, it was recognized that half of these patients never had their colostomy reversed and that colostomy closure was a morbid procedure. As a result starting in the 1990s colorectal surgical specialists increasing performed a one stage primary resection anastomosis (PRA) and demonstrated similar outcomes to the two stage procedure. In the mid 2000s, the colorectal surgeons promoted this as standard of care. But unfortunately despite advances in perioperative care and their excellent surgical skills, PRA for stage III/IV diverticulitis continued to have a high mortality (10–15%). The survivors require prolonged hospital stays and often do not fully recover. Recent case series indicate that a substantial portion of the patients who previously were subjected to emergency sigmoid colectomy can be successfully treated with less invasive nonoperative management with salvage PCD and/or laparoscopic lavage and drainage. These patients experience a surprisingly lower mortality and more rapid recovery. They are also spared the need for a colostomy and do not appear to benefit from a delayed elective sigmoid colectomy. While we await the final results ongoing prospective randomized clinical trials testing these less invasive alternatives, we have proposed (based primarily on case series and our expert opinions) what we believe safe and rationale management strategy.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^1173mDED]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Emergency surgery for Crohn's disease

Indications for emergency abdominal surgery in the setting of Crohn's disease include bowel obstruction, perforation, and bleeding. Management of patients with an intra-abdominal abscess has been dealt with elsewhere in this guideline.

Up to 16% of patients with Crohn's disease will present with a bowel perforation. Management decisions are often complex and will need to be made around mode of surgical access, decision for anastomosis, and if so, using which anastomotic technique. Bowel resection is generally required in the emergency setting, with the requirement for strictureplasty being more common in the elective setting. The type of resection needed will be according to the disease site, and this may be a small bowel resection, ileocecal resection, or colonic resection, generally subtotal colectomy.

In terms of mode of access, for the patient with bowel obstruction due to non-active stricturing disease or adhesions, a laparoscopic approach is preferred, according to local expertise, as there is evidence for reduced length of stay and fewer complications. Great care is needed on establishing pneumoperitoneum, as the bowel will be distended, and as such, an open port insertion technique should be used. Available data relate to multi-port laparoscopic approach, as opposed to single-port, and there are no data to support a robotic approach in this setting.

An open approach remains preferable in the setting of bleeding with hemodynamic instability where endoscopic and interventional radiology techniques have not been successful, and in a patient with a free perforation. When a patient with a free perforation has severe sepsis or septic shock, and associated significant peritoneal contamination, it may be preferable to perform damage limitation surgery in the form of bowel resection with stapled off bowel ends, peritoneal lavage, laparostomy, and rapid return to ICU for on-going care, with a planned second look laparotomy 24–48 h later with further bowel inspection, peritoneal lavage, abdominal closure, and consideration of stoma formation versus anastomosis.

Implications for research

Given the global prevalence of PUD and the increasing elderly population in both developed and developing nations, optimizing emergency care is crucial for mitigating the burden of PPU. This necessitates international collaboration to conduct robust trials investigating various aspects of the disease.

Firstly, further research is needed to define precise selection criteria for conservative management, differentiating between healthy and frail patient cohorts. Moreover, establishing standardized criteria for disease severity will facilitate the development of tailored management strategies and improve treatment outcomes.

Future RCTs should rigorously compare laparoscopic and open approaches, utilizing robust endpoints such as morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, future studies should focus on identifying risk factors for less common but potentially serious complications, such as reoperation and intra-abdominal abscesses.

Concerning operative variables, further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal use of omental patches and to establish evidence-based guidelines for antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis.

Lastly, studies reporting long-term outcomes, particularly in younger populations, are urgently required to better analyze recurrence rates and patient-reported quality-of-life measures.

### Functional outcomes of emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis, hinchey grade III [^111Pjgsp]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic lavage as a treatment for perforated diverticulitis, Hinchey III, has been found safe and feasible in randomized trials. A few studies have reported functional outcomes and quality of life as secondary outcomes. This study investigated distress associated with dysfunction of the bowel or stoma, functional outcomes, and quality of life 2–3 years after surgery in a national unselected cohort.

Methods

All patients in Sweden who underwent emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis (2016–2018) were invited to answer a comprehensive, study-specific questionnaire 2–3 years after the index surgery.

Results

Out of 499 potential patients, 226 returned the questionnaire, and 209 were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between laparoscopic lavage and resection in distress associated with dysfunction of the bowel or stoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.32 [95% CI, 0.91–1.92]; p = 0.015). Bowel dysfunction measured by the LARS score was significantly higher for the lavage group (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.11–2.45]), while stoma was more frequent after resection surgery (40 vs 6%).

Conclusions

Patients experienced long-term distress from bodily dysfunction after emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis regardless of the technique used. Regular follow-up could benefit these patients.

Trial Registration

The project was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 2017–11–06. Identifier: NCT03332550. Acronym: LapLav.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^116wRndH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Should damage control surgery with staged laparotomies be recommended in patients with acute peritonitis due to diverticular perforation?

We suggest damage control surgery (DCS) with staged laparotomies in selected unstable patients with diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

A damage control surgical strategy may be useful for patients in physiological extremis from abdominal sepsis. The initial surgery focuses on control of the sepsis, and a subsequent operation deals with the anatomical restoration of the gastrointestinal tract, after a period of physiological resuscitation. This strategy facilitates both the control of the severe sepsis control as well as potentially improving the rate of primary anastomosis.

Generalized diverticular peritonitis is a life-threatening condition requiring prompt emergency operation. To improve outcomes and reduce the rate of colostomy formation, a new algorithm for damage control operation, lavage, limited resection or closure of perforation, and second look surgery to restore intestinal continuity was developed in recent years. Some patients may be physiologically deranged. These patients, who are hemodynamically unstable, are not optimal candidates for immediate complex operative interventions. After initial surgery, which should be limited to source control, e.g. primary closure of the perforation/local resection of the diseased bowel, the patient is taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) for physiologic optimization. However, this strategy will also delay bowel anastomosis to a period of physiological stability potentially changing the intraoperative physiological milieu, potentially favoring a primary anastomosis, and avoiding the formation of a stoma altogether. In the setting of acute diverticulitis, several reports (with low level of evidence) were published. In 2010, a prospective observational study was published by Kafka-Ritsch et al. A total of 51 patients (28 females 55%) with a median age of 69 (range 28–87) years, with perforated diverticulitis Hinchey III (n = 40, 78%) or Hinchey IV (n = 11, 22%), were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients were initially managed with limited resection, lavage, and temporary abdominal closure followed by second, reconstructive operation 24–48 h later, which are supervised by a colorectal surgeon. Bowel continuity was restored in 38 (84%) patients, of which four were protected by a loop ileostomy. Five anastomotic leaks (13%) were encountered requiring loop ileostomy in two patients and a HP in remaining three patients. The overall mortality rate was 9.8%, and 35 of 46 surviving patients (76%) left the hospital with reconstructed colon continuity. Fascial closure was achieved in all patients.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^112KLUEZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Perforation with generalized peritonitis is the most common life-threatening emergency requiring surgical intervention in diverticular disease of the colon. Whereas most people with diverticular disease remain asymptomatic, approximately 15% develop symptoms, and of these 15% will develop significant complications, such as perforation. In most cases perforation is the first manifestation of the disease. Although the absolute prevalence of perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis is low, its importance lies in the significant postoperative mortality, ranging from 4–26% regardless of selected surgical strategy.

Until today the optimal treatment for perforated diverticulitis has been a matter of debate. During the last decades, the "gold standard" has changed several times. Primary resection has become the standard practice, but fear of anastomotic leakage often deterred many surgeons from performing primary anastomosis. Therefore, for many surgeons Hartmann's procedure (HP) has remained the favored option for these patients. Nevertheless, improvements in surgical techniques, radiological intervention techniques, anesthesia, advances in intensive care medicine, and progress in the management of peritoneal sepsis have led to an increasing interest in resection with primary anastomosis (PA) with or without diverting stoma or colonic lavage.

Recently, laparoscopic lavage and drainage without resection has been successfully used for patients who have generalized peritonitis caused by perforated diverticulitis (PPD). Because this nonresectional mini-invasive surgical strategy was associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality, it might be a promising alternative to the standard open resectional practice.

This paper includes an overview of the development of different surgical strategies in PPD through the years, and based on this overview we present our personal opinion for the management of this surgical emergency.

Gastrointestinal leaks and fistulae are common postoperative complications, whereas intestinal perforation more commonly complicates advanced endoscopic procedures. Although these complications have classically been managed surgically, there exists an ever-expanding role for endoscopic therapy and the involvement of advanced endoscopists as part of a multidisciplinary team including surgeons and interventional radiologists. This review will serve to highlight the innovative endoscopic interventions that provide an expanding range of viable endoscopic approaches to the management and therapy of gastrointestinal perforation, leaks, and fistulae.

### Abdominal emergencies in inflammatory bowel disease [^113mtyPA]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although improved medical therapies have been associated with decreased rates of emergent intestinal resection for inflammatory bowel disease, prompt diagnosis and management remain of utmost importance to ensure appropriate patient care with reduced morbidity and mortality. Emergent indications for surgery include toxic colitis, acute obstruction, perforation, acute abscess, or massive hemorrhage. Given this broad spectrum of emergent presentations, a multidisciplinary team including surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, nutritional support services, and enterostomal therapists are required for optimal patient care and decision making. Management of each emergency should be individualized based on patient age, disease type and duration, and patient goals of care.

### Intestinal perforation in gynecologic oncology: do all patients benefit from surgical management? [^1119mPg6]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify those patients with gynecologic cancers and intestinal perforation in whom conservative management may be appropriate.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all gynecologic oncology patients with intestinal perforation at our institution between 1995 and 2011. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze factors influencing survival.

Results

Forty-three patients met the study criteria. The mean age was 59 years (range: 38–82 years). A large number of patients had peritoneal carcinomatosis and history of bowel obstruction. Surgery was performed in 28 patients, and 15 were managed conservatively. Overall mortality at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was 26%, 40%, 47%, and 59%, respectively. Only cancer burden at the time of perforation was independently predictive of mortality. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, distant metastasis, or both were at 42 times higher risk of death than those with no evidence of disease (95% CI: 3.28–639.83), and at 7 times higher risk of death than those with microscopic/localized disease (95% CI: 1.77–29.94). When adjusted for the extent of disease spread, management approach (conservative vs. surgical) was not a significant predictor of survival (p ≥ 0.05). The length of hospital stay (19 days vs. 7 days) and the complication rate (75% vs. 26.7%) were significantly higher in the surgical group than in the non-surgical group (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients who develop intestinal perforation in the setting of widely metastatic disease have a particularly poor prognosis. Aggressive surgical management is unlikely to benefit such patients and further impairs their quality of life.

### Prospectively randomized controlled trial on damage control surgery for perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis [^115Lf1nw]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study protocol

Inclusion criteria

All patients admitted to our department with clinical and radiological suspicion of colonic perforation and generalized peritonitis and who were scheduled for emergency surgery were included in the study.

Exclusion criteria

No patient consent.

Age < 18 years.

Pregnancy.

Preoperative anal incontinence.

Intraoperative

Covered perforation or peritonitis limited to one quadrant

No colonic perforation (gastric perforation, appendicitis,…)

Malignancy as cause of perforation

Primary endpoint

Reconstructed bowel continuity at discharge and at 6 months.

Secondary endpoint

Permanent stoma rate.

30-day mortality rate.

Postoperative complications.

All patients preoperatively granted their consent to participate in the study when the indication for emergency surgery was set. After the performing surgeon confirmed colonic perforation with generalized peritonitis, randomization was performed intraoperatively using numbered sealed envelopes prepared by our study centre with computer generated randomization. The envelopes were blocked for ten patients to ensure equal groups.

Surgical strategy

In the damage control surgery (DCS) group, the surgeon was asked to perform rapid source control by stapling the perforated segment thus leaving blind ends or by suturing the perforation site if possible, doing a thorough lavage of the abdominal cavity and placing an intra-abdominal negative-pressure system (ABThera KCI ®, San Antonio, Texas) with 125 mm HG continuously and avoiding retraction of the abdominal wall with dynamic sutures, as published. The second-look operation was scheduled for a time 24–48 h after primary surgery that would be during regular working hours with a colorectal surgeon on hand to make the decision for either anastomosis or ostomy.

In the conventional treatment group (Group C), the perforated colon was resected and bowel continuity reconstructed or a Hartmann procedure was performed immediately. The decision to reconstruct the colon or perform a Hartmann procedure was made by the surgeon on duty during the emergency operation. After performing the anastomosis or the Hartmann procedure, patients with advanced peritonitis received an intra-abdominal negative-pressure system at the discretion of the operating surgeon. This possibility was requested by an intensive care anaesthetist as a member of the local Ethics Committee.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^1121ftvE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and significance

Pathogenesis

Diverticular disease is common affecting over 50% of men and women older than 65 years. Diverticulitis is inflammation of the colon that occurs as a result of perforation of a diverticulum almost exclusively in the sigmoid colon and incidence is estimated to be 3.4 to 4.5 per 100,000 people per year. Diverticulitis is known as the disease of the industrial revolution, since there are no reports or pathologic specimens documenting evidence of diverticular disease prior to the 1900s. In the late 1800s, the process of roller-milling wheat was introduced which removes two thirds of the fiber content of wheat. Coincident with this implementation, diverticulosis was observed in the first decade of the 1900s. It is now known that a diet low in fiber is a contributing factor in the development of diverticular disease. In a study of nearly 48,000 US men, a low-fiber diet increased the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease by two- to threefold over a 4-year period. In addition to low dietary fiber, alterations in colonic intraluminal pressures have been shown in patients with diverticular disease. Although resting intraluminal pressures between diverticular disease patients and controls do not differ significantly, higher pressures have been demonstrated in segments of colon with diverticula. In addition, later studies indicate increased colonic motility, as assessed by the number and amplitude of bowel wall contractions, in the sigmoid colon of patients with diverticular disease. Therefore, both a low-fiber diet and colonic dysmotility have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverticular disease.

Treatment options

These are based upon the stage of disease. Table 1 depicts a scoring system that subdivides diverticulitis based upon the extent of disease identified on computerized tomography (CT) scanning. The traditional Hinchey classification was developed before routine CT scanning and we have modified it slightly to reflect contemporary management decisions that are based on CT scan findings. Most clinicians are comfortable treating patients stage IA and IB diverticulitis with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and bowel rest. They will also readily opt for interventional radiology percutaneous drainage (PCD) in patients with stage IIB disease as long as the patients do not have severe sepsis/septic shock (SS/SS). However, there is considerable controversy over what is the best option for patients who present with stage III and IV diverticulitis who have signs of SS/SS. The treatment options for these patients are described below:

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^115rC1Z3]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Nonresectional nonsurgical lavage

Until the 1990s, all stages of perforated diverticulitis were treated by surgery. The principles of primary treatment of abdominal infections caused by perforation, as outlined by Polk in 1979 have not changed much during the years. These principles include alimentary tract decompression, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics to cover gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, and so-called "source control". Source control consists of all measurements to eliminate the source of infection, to control ongoing contamination, and to restore premorbid anatomy and its function.

The progress of antibiotic development and interventional radiographic techniques has changed the management of perforated diverticulitis. The high specificity of CT scan has allowed this modality to become a surrogate to the perioperative assessment made by the Hinchey classification. Furthermore, CT scan has become an important therapeutic modality. It is now recognized that patients with small, contained perforations, who are not systemically ill, can be treated initially with antibiotics alone or by CT-guided percutaneous drainage. Source control by percutaneous drainage has become the treatment of choice for most abscesses, provided that adequate drainage is possible and no debridement or repair of anatomical structures is necessary. The size of the drain used is very important because complete evacuation of the abscess must be obtained. If the abscess cannot be drained sufficiently, source control will fail. Although mechanical control of the source of infection remains important, several studies have found that abscesses up to 4 cm seem to respond better to antibiotics alone. Currently, the only patients who require surgery (laparoscopically or open) for source control are those who fail conservative treatment and those who require emergency surgery, mostly patients with PPD.

### Case of small bowel perforation secondary to nivolumab and ipilimumab related tumour regression [^116BmCwD]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 56-year-old man undergoing immunotherapy treatment for metastatic melanoma presented with sudden onset testicular pain radiating into his abdomen. On examination, the abdomen was generally tender with associated guarding. Imaging revealed a perforation of the small bowel at the site of a metastatic lesion. Histology revealed that this process was non-inflammatory in nature. A diagnosis of small bowel perforation secondary to immunotherapy driven rapid tumour regression was made. The patient was treated with a small bowel resection plus anastomosis and made a full recovery. This case highlights the rare potential side effect of immunotherapy in causing non-inflammatory bowel perforations secondary to rapid tumour regression.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^116gN7yU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of choice of perforated gastric cancer is surgery. In most instances gastric carcinoma is not suspected as the cause of perforation prior to emergency laparotomy, and the diagnosis of malignancy is often made only by intraoperative or postoperative pathologic examination. The treatment should aim to manage both the emergency condition of peritonitis and the oncologic technical aspects of surgery.

Perforation alone does not significantly affect long term survival after gastrectomy, differed resection (i.e. two stage radical gastrectomy) does not affect long term outcome.

The presence of preoperative shock seems to be the most important negative prognostic factor for immediate postoperative survival after surgery for perforated gastric cancer.

Therefore, patients who have perforated gastric cancer should undergo appropriate gastric resection in spite of concurrent peritonitis unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or has unresectable cancer.

Small bowel perforations

In patients with small bowel perforations, surgery is the treatment of choice. (Recommendation 1 A).

In case of small perforations, primary repair is preferable; when resection is required, the technique of anastomosis does not influence postoperative mortality or morbidity rates. (Recommendation 2 B).

Laparoscopic approach should be performed by a laparoscopically experienced surgeon in selected institutions (Recommendation 2 C).

Primary repair of perforated bowel is preferable to resection and anastomosis because it carries a lower complication rate even if the better outcome may reflect the limited tissue injury in these patients. Primary repair should not be performed in patients who have malignant lesions, necrotic bowel, perforations associated with mesenteric vascular injuries, or multiple contiguous perforations.

When resection is required, the entire diseased segment is resected, leaving healthy, well perfused ends for anastomosis. The technique for the enteroenterostomy, whether stapled or hand-sewn, seems to have little impact on the anastomotic complication rate.

Primary bowel anastomosis must be considered cautiously in the setting of gross purulent or feculent peritonitis because of a high rate of serious complications. Laparoscopic management of small bowel perforations was reported but there was no comparative study with open surgery.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^114uqwW5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2010, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published the guidelines for the management of obstructive left colon cancer. The 2017 guidelines represent both an update and an implementation of the previous edition: the management of perforation and obstruction associated with right-sided colon cancer is also included into the current guidelines.

The relevance of the topic is evident with the help of the following statements:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy, accounting for about 1.4 million new cases per year. It represents the third most common cancer in men (746,000 cases, 10.0% of the total) and the second in women (614,000 cases, 9.2% of the total) worldwide; it is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the world, with almost 700,000 deaths in 2012.
The incidence of CRC varies by geographic region: in Europe, the incidence is higher than in North America, followed by Oceania, Latin America and Africa. However, the trend of CRC seems to vary according to the Human Development Index (HDI), with a variability parallel to changes in diet, smoke attitude, activity patterns and screening programs. A decreasing rate is reported in North America, Oceania and Europe and in particular in the USA, New Zealand and France; on the other side, an increasing incidence is observed in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe.

A word of caution must be spent with regards to the increasing incidence of CRC in the population younger than 50 years: this could potentially encourage an update in screening programs.
Complications of large bowel diseases account for 47% of gastrointestinal emergencies.
CRC presents as emergency in a wide range of patients (from 7 to 40% of the total), but the vast majority of reports present a figure of around 30%.
Large bowel obstruction (LBO) represents almost 80% (15–30% of CRC) of the emergencies related to CRC, while perforation accounts for the remaining 20% (1–10% of CRC).
The most common location of CRC obstruction is the sigmoid colon, with 75% of the tumours located distal to the splenic flexure.
Perforation occurs at the tumour site in almost 70% of cases and proximal to the tumour site in around 30% of cases.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^113GSgqc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Statement 9

Highly selected patients with perforated diverticulitis (including those with an abscess < 4 cm in diameter), a peri-appendiceal mass, or a perforated peptic ulcer can be managed without definitive source control if responding satisfactorily to antimicrobial therapy and other supportive measures. (Recommendation 1 B).

An operative intervention remains the most viable therapeutic strategy for managing intra-abdominal sepsis. Surgical source control entails resection or suture of a diseased or perforated viscus (e.g. diverticular perforation, gastroduodenal perforation), removal of the infected organ (e.g. appendix, gallbladder), debridement of necrotic tissue, resection of ischemic bowel, and repair/resection of traumatic perforations with primary anastomosis or exteriorization of the bowel.

However, some data indicate highly selected patients can be managed without definitive source control if responding satisfactorily to antimicrobial therapy alone.

In addition, well-localized fluid collections of appropriate density and consistency (i.e. lack of extensive loculations) may be drained percutaneously with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. These abscesses may be initially treated by intravenous antibiotics alone with or without percutaneous drainage, depending on the size of the abscess. A maximum diameter of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted as a reasonable limit for treatment with antimicrobial therapy alone without drainage.

Although the absolute prevalence of perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis is low, it has a significant post-operative mortality, regardless of selected surgical strategy. However, CT findings of distant free air (a known predictor of failure of non-operative treatment) does not necessarily obligate a surgical approach. Dharmarajan et al. described a high success rate for non-operative management in patients with acute diverticulitis and a pneumoperitoneum, excluding those with hemodynamic instability.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^116LDfWi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conservative treatment consists of serial clinical and imaging monitoring (every 3–6 h) with absolute bowel rest, intravenous fluids for hydration, intravenous administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a close multidisciplinary team follow-up to promptly detect the development of sepsis and peritoneal signs. Drainage of the peritoneal air through a Veress needle punction may be useful in relieving abdominal pain, improving respiratory function, and facilitating the closure of the perforation site. The overall success rate of conservative treatments for colonic perforation varies from 33 to 90%.

An early success with non-surgical treatment does not rule out the potential need for surgery. If the conservative treatment is successful, clinical improvement will gradually occur within 24 h, but a continuous and strict clinical and biochemical follow-up is recommended. In cases of clinical deterioration or progression to a septic condition or peritonitis, surgical treatment should not be delayed. The sole presence of subdiaphragmatic free air does not constitute an indication for urgent surgery. Of note, complication rates and lengths of hospital stay are significantly higher in patients who have undergone surgery after conservative management than in patients who were initially treated with surgery. Indeed, when surgical treatment is delayed, the peritonitis and colonic wall inflammation could worsen, requiring a more invasive surgery that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Ideally, the decision to pursue surgery should be made as early as possible after the endoscopy.

### Alternative treatments to treat perforated peptic ulcer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111YiR9Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and endoscopic interventions, represent viable alternatives to open surgery for PPU. While laparoscopic repair offers distinct advantages in reducing surgical site infections and postoperative pain, endoscopic approaches may be particularly beneficial for high-risk patients. Individualized treatment plans considering patient characteristics and perforation features are crucial to optimizing outcomes and reducing the burden of PPU. Randomized trials with larger sample sizes and multicenter collaborations are essential to validate the findings of this analysis and provide further robust evidence for clinical guidelines.

### Management of colonoscopic perforation: a systematic review and treatment algorithm [^113cXur9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this review is to evaluate and summarize the current strategies used in the management of colonoscopic perforations as well as propose a modern treatment algorithm.

Methods

Articles published between January 2004 and January 2019 were screened. A total of 167 reports were identified in combined literature search, of which 61 articles were selected after exclusion of duplicate and unrelated articles. Only studies that reported on the management of endoscopic perforation in an adult population were retrieved for review. Case reports and case series of 8 patients or less were not considered. Ultimately, 19 articles were considered eligible for review.

Results

A total of 744 cases of colonoscopic perforations were reported in 19 major articles. The cause of perforation was mentioned in 16 articles. Colonoscopic perforations were reported as a consequence of diagnostic colonoscopies in 222 cases and therapeutic colonoscopies in 248 cases. The site of perforation was mentioned in 486 cases. Sigmoid colon was the predominant site followed by the cecum. The management of colonoscopic perforations was reported in a total of 741 patients. Surgical intervention was employed in 75% of the patients, of these 15% were laparoscopic and 85% required laparotomy. The predominant surgical intervention was primary repair.

Conclusion

Management strategies of colon perforations depend upon the etiology, size, severity, location, available expertise, and general health status. Usually, peritonitis, sepsis, or hemodynamic compromise requires immediate surgical management. Endoscopic techniques are under continuous evolution. Newer developments have offered high success rate with least amount of post-procedure complications. However, there is a need for further studies to compare the newer endoscopic techniques in terms of success rate, cost, complications, and the affected part of colon.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^112XqPGG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-operative management — endoscopic treatment

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which are the indications for non-operative management?

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer we suggest against a routinely use of non-operative management; non-operative management (NOM) could be considered in extremely selected cases where perforation has sealed as confirmed on water-soluble contrast study (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C).

Non-operative management (NOM) of perforated peptic ulcer is attractive as it avoids surgery and its resultant morbidity, e.g. wound-related morbidity, postoperative adhesions, etc. The rationale of NOM is that, in the case of small perforations, the ulcer seals by omental adhesions and can then heal and the peritonitis does not need operation. In 1989 Croft et al. conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing emergency surgery and NOM in patients with a clinical diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer: 83 patients were entered in the study over a period of 13 months and were randomly assigned to one the two study groups. In the NOM group, 11 patients (28 percent) had no clinical Improvement after 12 h and required an operation. The overall mortality rates in the two groups were similar (two deaths in each, 5%), and did not differ significantly in the morbidity rates (40% in the surgical group and 50% in the nonsurgical group). The hospital stay was 35% longer in the group treated conservatively and patients over 70 years old were less likely to respond to conservative treatment than younger patients (p < 0.05). Songne et al. in 2004 conducted a prospective trial of 82 consecutive patients with diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer; they initially underwent NOM and clinical improvement was achieved in 54% of patients after NOM. In multivariate analysis, the factors independently related to NOM failure were size of pneumoperitoneum, heart rate > 94 bpm, and abdominal meteorism (defined as distended bowel loops). In conclusion, the most important factors regarding the feasibility of NOM for perforated peptic ulcer are normal vital signs in a stable patient and whether the ulcer itself has sealed as confirmed by a water-soluble contrast study: if there is a free leak of contrast, surgery is needed. On the other hand, NOM could be considered if no contrast extravasation is present and the patient does not have signs of peritonitis or sepsis.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114zPfHg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer stage II risk assessment — patient/physician discussion should take place regarding the potential risks of therapy compared to potential benefits, including prognosis, and this should include discussion of evidence supporting treatment, assumptions of benefit from indirect evidence, morbidity associated with treatment, high-risk characteristics, and patient preferences. When determining if adjuvant therapy should be administered, the following should be taken into consideration: number of lymph nodes analyzed after surgery (< 12); poor prognostic features (eg, poorly differentiated histology [exclusive of those that are MSI-H]; lymphatic/vascular invasion; bowel obstruction; PNI; localized perforation; close, indeterminate, or positive margins; or high tumor budding); and assessment of other comorbidities and anticipated life expectancy. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival by more than 5%, and MSI or MMR testing is listed among the items. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^113iPLmL]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The supposed optimal treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis has changed several times during the last century, but at present is still unclear.

Methods/Results

The first cases of complicated perforated diverticulitis of the colon were reported in the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time the first therapeutic guidelines were postulated in which an initial nonresectional procedure was provided to be the safest plan of management. After many years in which resection had become standard practice, today, one century later, again (laparoscopic) nonresectional surgery is presented as a safe and promising alternative in treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis. The question rises what had happened to close the circle?

Conclusions

This paper includes a historic summary of changing patterns in surgical strategies in perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis.

### Management of iatrogenic perforation [^1118PQMx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is a medical emergency and is inevitable. An endoscopist must maintain a high index of suspicion despite minimal or atypical symptoms and negative radiologic studies, because perforation is a complication with tremendous morbidity and mortality. The endoscopist must know how to manage this complication appropriately and to seek immediate surgical consultation. There is ongoing controversy about when a patient should undergo nonoperative or surgical therapy. An evidence-based approach to manage iatrogenic perforation is not possible. The trend in the modern era is to less invasive, nonoperative therapy, given advancements in ICU care and antibiotics. Laparoscopy or laparoscopic-assisted (minilaparotomy) surgery is also being increasingly used with outcomes comparable with conventional laparotomy. Experience and advancements in accessories have enabled endoscopic repair of iatrogenic perforation in many situations [84]. The management algorithms provided synthesize the pertinent literature into reasonable guidelines to follow. Ultimately, an individualized approach must be taken to manage the patient with an iatrogenic perforation.

Necrotizing enterocolitis is a severe gastrointestinal disease of the infant. It most commonly targets those that are born prematurely. NEC has been associated with initiation of feeds and in most cases, it can be managed with antibiotics and bowel rest. However, in up to half of the cases, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and failure of medical treatment will require surgical intervention. The following review will discuss the surgical approach to managing NEC, based on an updated review of practice patterns and recently published literature.

### Cesena guidelines: WSES consensus statement on laparoscopic-first approach to general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma [^113eJ83q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation (ICP)

An increasing number of screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic colonoscopies are being performed every year with therapeutic colonoscopies generally associated with a higher risk for ICP considering the age and the increase of comorbidities in patients that undergo colonoscopy, and current endoscopic excision/resection techniques with deeper wall dissection. Emergency surgery is indicated as the first line treatment in patients with ongoing sepsis, signs of diffuse peritonitis, large perforations, and failure of conservative management and in the presence of certain concomitant pathologies, such as unresected polyps with high suspicion of being a carcinoma.

The 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation recommend laparoscopy as the preferred first-line surgical approach for the management of ICP. Conversion should be considered whenever necessary regarding the ability of the operator to proceed laparoscopically, the tissues viability, and the patient's overall status. Patient instability was considered as the only absolute contraindication to a laparoscopic-first approach.

Laparoscopic approach in acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI)

Traditionally, AMI has been treated with open surgery. Over the past two decades, the development of endovascular techniques has made this approach an alternative for patients with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). There has been an absence of randomized controlled trials due to the strong heterogeneity and physiological diversity of patients with AMI, and controversies regarding the use of endovascular techniques as the primary management of AMI. Nonetheless, in a systematic review and meta-analysis El Farargy et al. have shown that endovascular therapy is associated with lower rates of mortality and bowel resection than the traditional, open approach.

AMI course has three stages: ischemia, necrosis, peritonitis. There is a discrepancy between subjective pain and objective tenderness and intraoperative findings: this relates to the timeline of the ischemic process. In the initial stages of ischemia surgical inspection of the bowel itself is not informative, as the ischemia starts from the mucosa toward the serosa and bowel is peristaltic, not black, the peritoneum is shiny which can lead to a false negative result.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^11431UaX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

When a colectomy for diverticular disease is performed, a laparoscopic approach is appropriate in selected patients (Recommendation 1 B).

Laparoscopic colectomy may have advantages over open laparotomy, including less pain, smaller scar, and shorter recovery. There is no increase in early or late complications. Cost and outcome are comparable to open resection. Laparoscopic surgery is acceptable in the elderly and seems to be safe in selected patients with complicated disease.

Urgent operation is required for patients with diffuse peritonitis or for those who fail non-operative management of acute diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 B).

If a patient presents with severe or diffuse peritonitis, emergency colon resection is necessary. Also, if sepsis does not improve with inpatient conservative treatment of acute diverticulitis or after percutaneous drainage, surgery is indicated. Immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients are more likely to present with perforation or fail medical management, so a lower threshold for urgent or elective surgery should apply to them. The source control of diffuse peritonitis is discussed together in the next topic of large bowel perforations.

### Short article: outcome of medical and surgical management for perforated jejunal diverticulitis [^116HtKw7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Perforated jejunal diverticulitis (PJD) is rare, but it has high mortality rates. The role of nonsurgical management is debated. The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of medical and surgical management of PJD.

Patients and Methods

A single-centre study on a series of emergency patients diagnosed with PJD between 2010 and 2016 was conducted.

Results

Eleven patients with PJD were treated (seven women). Nine out of 11 were diagnosed by a computed tomography scan, and two were diagnosed at laparotomy. The initial approach was medical treatment in five patients, based on clinical and imaging findings. Four (80%) of these five patients were discharged without the need for surgical intervention. The median hospital stay was 7.5 days. Seven patients required surgery overall with a median length of hospital stay of 10.8 days. Surgical procedures consisted of segmental bowel resection and primary anastomosis in six patients and simple closure in one. There was no perioperative deaths. One patient required percutaneous drainage because of anastomotic leak, and one required reoperation owing to evisceration.

Discussion

Selected patients with PJD can be successfully managed with conservative approach, based on clinical and computed tomography findings.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^1171thn8]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Three-staged procedure

Since the beginning of the previous century, a three-stage operation strategy was common practice for the treatment of diverticular disease. The first report of surgical treatment for complicated diverticulitis was by Mayo in 1907. The classic three-stage operation includes an initial diverting colostomy and drainage followed by resection of the involved colon and, finally, a colostomy closure as the third stage. This nonresectional surgery strategy was reaffirmed and advocated by the experiences at the Mayo Clinic, which presented the results in 1924, to be the safest.

During the next two decades, indications for emergency surgery evolved toward complicated diverticulitis, such as perforation, obstruction, and fistula formation, only. A preliminary transverse colostomy was advised in all cases in which resection was contemplated, and the period of delay before this resection should be from 3 to 6 months. The rationale for this strategy was that primary resection is too difficult in the acute stage of the disease, often causing iatrogenic complications and hence mortality. After the fecal stream was diverged by performing a transverse colostomy during the first surgical stage, drainage of the abdomen and pelvic cavity was initiated to diminish sigmoid inflammation. After several months the second stage — resection of the involved bowel — could be performed to treat and prevent relapse of the disease. Smithwick advocated this procedure in favor toward resectional operations. He reported a postoperative mortality after a three-stage procedure of nearby 12% compared with 17% if the involved colon segment was resected during initial surgery. Considering that antibiotics were not discovered yet, these results can be regarded as remarkable.

### Gastric, duodenal, and small bowel emergencies [^115ZF83v]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastric and small bowel emergencies are often seen in the emergency department and require rapid assessment and intervention as patients can deteriorate quickly. Some of the more frequently seen gastric emergencies include gastric volvulus and peptic ulcer disease, which can present with ischemia, strangulation, perforation, or severe bleeding. Swift diagnosis is crucial to ensuring the proper management whether that is endoscopic or with surgical exploration. Perforated peptic ulcers that are not contained will require surgical intervention, whereas bleeding ulcers can often be controlled with endoscopic interventions.

### Small bowel emergency surgery: literature's review [^111zHxRj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease

Acute surgical emergencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are infrequent but may be dangerous for life. Crohn's disease is an important cause of small bowel acute surgery. Ileal localization, particularly terminal ileum, is the most frequent in Crohn's disease, despite its pan-intestinal nature. Skip lesions interest full-thickness the bowel wall and are able to induce a wide spectrum of acute surgical emergencies. Small bowel is the main site of bleeding in Crohn's disease. The bleeding is often from a localized source, caused by erosion of a blood vessel within multiple deep ulcerations that extend into bowel wall. Severe hemorrhage is rare and requires surgery. Other surgical indications include a bleeding who doesn't slow after 4 to 6 units of blood and recurrent hemorrhage. Because of segmental disease, the best approach is to localize the source of bleeding preoperatively. The patient is stabilized and a nasogastric tube is inserted. Gastroscopy, angiography and the use of labeled red cells scan help localizing the hemorrhage. If the site of bleeding is identified in small bowel, resection and primary anastomosis is the gold standard surgical treatment. Perforation is another surgical emergency in patients with Crohn's disease. It occurs in 1% to 3% of cases. The transmural nature of Crohn's disease creates inflammatory adhesions between bowel and local structures, so the perforation is often sealed. If perforation is suspected, the patient must be resuscitated and prepared to surgery. Jejunal and ileal perforations require resection and primary anastomosis if possible. Otherwise resection with intestinal diversion is necessary. More than 25% of patients undergoing surgery for Crohn's disease will have either an intra-abdominal mass or abscess, and 40% of these have an associated fistula. An intra-abdominal mass may be the consequence of distended loops of proximal bowel caused by distant strictures, thinning of diseased loops, phlegmon with associated fistulae, or an abscess cavity. The cause of abdominal abscesses is the transmural ulceration of the diseased bowel, which creates secondary adhesions to adjacent structures resulting in intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal or rarely intramesenteric abscesses. Progresses in interventional radiological techniques have increased, facilitating an improvement in patient's general conditions before the eventual surgical repair. If general conditions are favorable, in selected cases of perforation of the jejunum or ileum without abscess and early intervention, primary reconstruction is possible. However, having to do with intestinal perforation and abscessed small bowel, resection with fecal diversion is the gold standard surgical strategy. Intestinal obstruction is the main complication requiring surgical intervention in Crohn's disease, affecting 35% to 54% of patients. Because of transmural nature of disease process, obstruction can be the consequence of an acute and active inflammation superimposing on a stenotic portion of the bowel. Fibrosis and scarring with stricture formation, and mass effect of an adjacent abscess or phlegmon are common events in Crohn's disease. Although it is rare, a complete or near complete intestinal obstruction not responsive to medical therapy requires a surgical treatment. The treatment may be a resection or a strictureplasty depending on localization of the disease. Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacy procedure for small bowel Crohn's disease in the long term. Strictureplasty should be reserved only for fibrotic stricture with inactive disease and only if resection is inappropriate. Resection has been for a long time the mainstay treatment of Crohn's disease associated with small bowel strictures. However, recurrence rates are high and most of patients need multiple resections. So, the concern of short-bowel syndrome led to the use of bowel-sparing procedures. Principle indications for strictureplasty are multiple strictures over large length of bowel, previous resections, short bowel syndrome and strictures associated with phlegmon or fistula. Contraindications include preoperative malnutrition (albumin < 2 g/dL), perforation, multiple strictures over short length of bowel, stricture short distant from area of resection and bleeding from planned strictureplasty site. Several strictureplasty techniques have been described and the choice depends on the length of the stricture. Short strictures are treated with Heineke-Mikulicz strictureplasty. A longitudinal enterotomy is realized over the stricture on the antimesenteric border of the bowel and extended 1 to 2 cm onto either side of normal bowel. The enterotomy can be realized using bistury or cautery. Then, the enterotomy is closed transversally with a interrupted, sieromuscolar, absorbable suture. The closure should be performed in one or two layers and must be tension-free. The Finney strictureplasty is used for strictures of intermediate length. First of all, a stay suture is localized in the midpoint of the stricture. The enterotomy is performed throught the stricture, again extending 1 to 2 cm onto normal bowel. Then strictured segment is folded onto itself to realize a "U" and another stay suture is localized in the normal side of bowel to keep the "U" in place. The posterior edges are sutured in a continuous way using an absorbable suture. In the end, the anterior edges are closed with a interrupted non absorbable suture. In 1996, Michelassi introduced the side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty for long strictures, usually greater than 20 to 25 cm, and multiple strictures over a limited area. In this technique, the sctrictured bowel is lifted up and his mesentery is divided at the midpoint. Then the diseased bowel is divided between atraumatic bowel clamps at the midpoint of the stricture. The proximal end of the cut bowel is brought over the distal end in a side-to-side way. The two loops are approached with a single-layer, interrupted, non absorbable suture. Then enterotomy is realized longitudinally for the length of the stricture. The ends of bowel are spatulated to avoid blind ends. Next, a inner layer of running, full-thickness, absorbable suture is placed and continued anteriorly. This anterior layer is then followed by a layer of interrupted, non absorbable, sieromuscolar suture. Markedly thickened bowel loops, thickened and friable mesentery, inflammatory phlegoms, fistula, abscesses and adhesions from previous surgery represent a surgical challenge to the laparoscopic approach. Many studies in literature suggest that laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe in terminal ileal Crohn's disease, because it offers advantages in terms of pulmonary function, length of hospital stay, duration of postoperative ileus, cosmesis, postoperative small bowel obstruction, and early postoperative complications. Furthermore laparoscopy reduces the hospitalization costs and improves patient satisfaction.

### Management of bevacizumab-associated bowel perforation: a case series and review of the literature [^113cMfUs]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study examined the various approaches to the management of perforation and the associated outcomes in patients with bevacizumab-associated bowel perforation at a tertiary cancer center.

Patients and Methods

Our institutional pharmacy database was searched to identify all patients who had received bevacizumab over a 2-year period (January 2004 to October 2006). Medical records of these patients were examined for reports of confirmed bowel perforation or fistula, associated clinicopathological factors, treatment, and outcomes.

Results

We identified 1442 patients who had been treated with bevacizumab over the study period with perforation occurring in 24 (1.7%). The breakdown of these 24 patients by disease site was as follows: ovarian (3 of 50, 6%), gastroesophageal (2 of 38, 5.3%), pancreatic (7 of 141, 5%), unknown primary (1 of 60, 1.7%), lung (1 of 67, 1.5%), colorectal (6 of 478, 1.3%), and renal cell (4 of 269, 1.5%). The majority of patients (n = 19, 79%) were initially managed nonoperatively. Only five (21%) patients ultimately underwent surgical exploration, with a subsequent anastomotic leak developing in one patient. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 12.5%.

Conclusions

Bevacizumab-associated bowel perforation occurs in patients with various malignancies, with an incidence of 1.7%. Nonoperative treatment is a viable approach to management in selected patients.

### Is the ACS-NSQIP risk calculator accurate in predicting adverse postoperative outcomes in the emergency setting? An Italian single-center preliminary study [^1148L7RJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and data collection

The study was a single-institution retrospective review of patients treated in the General Surgery Department of Trieste's University Hospital. Ethical committee approval was obtained according to the Italian law, and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. Were considered for inclusion in the study all the patients aged 18 or older, admitted to our institution from January 2018 to the end of December 2018 with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation or bowel obstruction, and in which the indication to emergency surgical procedure was considered as first choice of treatment or as salvage surgery when previous non-operative management failed (e.g. antibiotic treatment, percutaneous drainage, stenting). Non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation included gastroduodenal perforation due to peptic ulcer disease, small bowel perforation, and colonic perforation with both neoplastic (colorectal cancer) and non-neoplastic (perforated diverticular disease) etiology. Bowel obstruction included small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions, tumors, gallstone ileus or foreign bodies, and large bowel obstruction caused by colorectal cancer. Exclusion criteria were: patients < 18, bowel obstruction or perforation as a complication of abdominal wall hernias, bowel obstruction or perforation which occurred as a postoperative complication, multiple simultaneous surgical procedures (more than one CPT code), missing preoperative or postoperative data.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^115eAEJK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — surgical therapy is indicated when nonoperative treatments fail or specific high-risk features are present. For patients in whom conservative, pharmacologic, and endoscopic treatment options fail, surgical intervention is the next appropriate step in management, and patients presenting with peritonitis, ischemia, perforation, clinical deterioration, or cecal diameter greater than 12 cm should also be referred for surgery. Because mortality rates are substantial in patients with ACPO who require surgical intervention, all efforts should be made to manage these patients nonoperatively, and in patients with ischemic or perforated bowel, surgical mortality as high as 44% has been reported. Surgically placed cecostomy tubes are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and female gender, emergent admission, and increased comorbidities (specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and metastatic cancer) have been identified as independent risk factors of colonoscopy failure.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^111LKQnH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Large bowel perforations

No practice guideline has been proposed for the source control of large bowel perforation.

Causes of large bowel perforations include (1) penetrating foreign body perforation, (2) extrinsic bowel obstruction, (3) intrinsic bowel obstruction, (4) direct loss of bowel wall integrity without foreign body perforation, (5) intestinal ischemia, and (6) infection.

The principles of source control include: control of the site of perforation, evacuation of contamination, debridement of necrotic tissue, and re-establishment of functional anatomy. Many patients who have large bowel perforations develop sepsis with accompanying hemodynamic compromise, hypothermia, acidosis, and a coagulopathy. These patients require rapid resuscitation and rapid surgery. The standard approach is known as damage control surgery. The goal is to rapidly obtain source control and peritoneal toilet without prolonging the surgery to restore functional anatomy or extensively mobilize tissues.

The decision whether to perform a proximal diverting procedure is based on the surgeon's assessment of the risks of anastomotic breakdown and other complications such as the patient's nutritional status, the quality of the tissues, the amount of bowel contamination, the extent of blood loss, and the intraoperative stability of the patient's condition.

Hartmann's procedure may be performed for the treatment of large bowel perforations (Recommendation 2 C).

Two-stage procedures are typically used in emergency situations with fecal peritonitis and in most cases with purulent peritonitis. A common approach is the Hartmann's procedure, which involves resection of the diseased colon, an end-colostomy, and creation of a rectal stump; this is followed by colostomy closure several months later. Reversal of Hartmann's procedure is also associated with substantial morbidity and even mortality. It is well known that patients with stomas may face both physical and psychological difficulties.

Primary anastomosis with or without proximal diverting stoma may be performed in selected patients (Recommendation 2 C).

It appears that resection and primary anastomosis, with or without proximal diverting stoma (colostomy or ileostomy), can be safely undertaken in selected patients who have phlegmons, abscess formation with localized peritonitis, diffuse purulent peritonitis, obstruction, or fistula formation. Although data are not available from randomized trials, observational studies that include matched patients suggest similar overall mortality rates and lower risks of wound infection and postoperative abscess formation with a one-stage approach. On-table colonic lavage may also be considered.

EAES and SAGES 2018 acute diverticulitis — laparoscopic resection in emergency surgery: Laparoscopic sigmoid resection with or without stoma in the emergency setting has been shown to decrease overall complications compared to open resections. When resection is indicated, we recommend consideration of laparoscopic approach for perforated diverticulitis in the appropriate clinical setting (LoE: low. Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Prospectively randomized controlled trial on damage control surgery for perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis [^114YhmAR]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Another shortcoming of our study is the fact that for medical reasons two patients were not treated with definitive surgery in the initial operation despite randomization to Group C. The experience of eight years of successful damage control surgery before establishing this randomized controlled study at our department led the surgeon and anaesthetist in charge to violate the protocol for ethical reasons, thus avoiding harm to the patient from a prolonged operation.

Based on his daily experience at the intensive care unit, the anaesthetist on our local Ethics Committee requested the possibility for negative abdominal pressure therapy, even for the control group, for the case of severe abdominal sepsis or advanced peritonitis. This therapy was applied in five out of ten patients in the control group. This reduces our chance to demonstrate an effect of the intra-abdominal negative-pressure system on postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, the study still demonstrates that the decision to reconstruct the colon is more frequently made in the second-look operation under elective conditions with a colorectal surgeon available. So considering a damage control surgery instead of performing a Hartmann´s procedure is a probable option.

It is important to note that patients treated with the surgical damage control concept with open abdomen and negative pressure can be extubated and mobilized as published before. Delayed surgery might constitute overtreatment for some patients, but sepsis development is unpredictable and a Hartmann procedure always requires a second operation anyway.

Laparoscopic lavage was proposed for patients in this setting despite the fact that conflicting results have been reported. We have little experience, because patients with only some free air bubbles or stable patients are treated conservatively or with percutaneous drainage at our department, as proposed in recent publications. Moreover, in this situation laparoscopy demands experience and is therefore not applicable for emergencies at night or on weekends, whereas a simple laparotomy, lavage and limited closure of a colon perforation can be performed even by general surgeons with little or no colorectal experience. Faecal peritonitis turned out to be a contraindication for laparoscopic lavage. In our study, faecal peritonitis was not a contraindication for anastomosis and did not result in a higher leakage or stoma rate.

In conclusion, we demonstrate control surgery and delayed creation of bowel continuation under elective conditions can be an option to avoid a stoma and should be taken into consideration before realizing a Hartmann´s procedure. This might play an important role in times of working hour restrictions and reduced availability of specialists, but a multicentre study with more power should confirm these first and limited randomized data.

### Laparoscopic lavage is feasible and safe for the treatment of perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis: the first results from the randomized controlled trial DILALA [^117XZpgF]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective:

To evaluate short-term outcomes of a new treatment for perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis in a randomized controlled trial.

Background:

Perforated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis (Hinchey III) has traditionally been treated with surgery including colon resection and stoma (Hartmann procedure) with considerable postoperative morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic lavage has been suggested as a less invasive surgical treatment.

Methods:

Laparoscopic lavage was compared with colon resection and stoma in a randomized controlled multicenter trial, DILALA (ISRCTN82208287). Initial diagnostic laparoscopy showing Hinchey III was followed by randomization. Clinical data was collected up to 12 weeks postoperatively.

Results: Eighty-three patients were randomized, out of whom 39 patients in laparoscopic lavage and 36 patients in the Hartmann procedure groups were available for analysis. Morbidity and mortality after laparoscopic lavage did not differ when compared with the Hartmann procedure. Laparoscopic lavage resulted in shorter operating time, shorter time in the recovery unit, and shorter hospital stay.

Conclusions:

In this trial, laparoscopic lavage as treatment for patients with perforated diverticulitis Hinchey III was feasible and safe in the short-term.

### Acute perforated peptic ulcer… [^1124Fru4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Opinions vary concerning the optimum treatment of acute gastroduodenal peptic perforation. 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 Not only does one have to consider the treatment of the acute abdominal catastrophe, but one should also bear in mind the prevention of future ulcer symptoms and dangerous complications. The most controversial unanswered question is whether the perforation per se is sufficient evidence of intractability to justify primary gastrectomy as the treatment of choice. To gain information pertinent to this question a study has been made of 154 cases of gastroduodenal perforation treated at the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals since 1952. Those patients surviving simple closure have been carefully followed in an effort to ascertain the number who have developed recurrent ulcer symptoms and complications. Results therefrom indicate that a high percentage of patients undergoing simple plication subsequently develop disabling ulcer symptoms.

Our findings also indicate that after simple plication, patients in whom preexisting ulcer symptoms. ROYSTER HP, HARRISON JM, MARTIN CJ. Acute Perforated Peptic Ulcer: Treatment by Primary Definitive Surgery. Arch Surg. 1963; 86: 230–232.
