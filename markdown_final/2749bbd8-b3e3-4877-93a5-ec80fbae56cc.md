## Question

Which autoimmune tests are recommended to screen for dysautonomia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which autoimmune tests are recommended to screen for dysautonomia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about high-credibility guideline statements that explicitly address autoimmune serology in autonomic failure. Then, I should verify the clinical scenarios that warrant testing versus those where it is low yield. Next, I will identify the specific antibodies to order and the rationale. After that, I need to consider supportive evidence and practice patterns. Finally, I will outline caveats, how these tests integrate with autonomic function testing, and practical next steps for implementation.

> Let me first confirm the anchor guidance so I don't overreach. The 2018 ESC syncope guidelines explicitly recommend obtaining paraneoplastic antibodies and anti–ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) antibodies when there is an acute or subacute onset of multidomain autonomic failure, which is the highest-yield scenario for autoimmune dysautonomia screening rather than routine testing in all comers with orthostatic symptoms [^115R1Bpj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should define the clinical phenotype that triggers testing. The key qualifiers are a rapid time course over weeks to months, prominent involvement of multiple autonomic domains such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and sudomotor systems, and the absence of a more likely chronic neurodegenerative trajectory, because the recommendation targets suspected autoimmune autonomic failure rather than long-standing synucleinopathy or isolated orthostatic intolerance presentations [^113ZTfCR] [^115fYbXB].

> Next, I should review exactly what to order so we are precise. I will now examine the paraneoplastic panel components and the principal antibody for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Paraneoplastic testing should include at minimum anti-Hu (ANNA-1), with consideration of broader panels such as anti-Ri, anti-Yo, CV2/CRMP5, amphiphysin, and SOX1 based on the clinical context, because anti-Hu–associated syndromes frequently include dysautonomia and can even present with dysautonomia alone in a minority of cases, which has direct implications for cancer surveillance and prognosis [^115R1Bpj]. The specific test for primary autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is serum anti–ganglionic nicotinic AChR antibodies, which serve as a diagnostic biomarker and link to an immunotherapy-responsive process, including idiopathic and paraneoplastic forms [^111yfNLF].

> Wait, let me verify the biological and clinical rationale before finalizing. Anti–ganglionic AChR antibodies define autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy as a nosological entity and explain widespread autonomic synaptic transmission failure, aligning with the acute or subacute multidomain pattern that prompts testing, while paraneoplastic antibodies, particularly anti-Hu, are mechanistically plausible correlates of cancer-associated dysautonomia that clinicians do not want to miss early [^111yfNLF] [^115R1Bpj].

> I should also confirm how often and where these tests are used in practice, just to ensure feasibility. A European survey of autonomic laboratories reports that a majority include autoantibody testing among their offerings, which reflects adoption of such testing in appropriate cases, even though implementation is heterogeneous and underscores the need for standardization of indications and methods across centers [^114LbKQx]. Complementary neurology guidelines for orthostatic hypotension emphasize tailoring additional investigations to suspected etiology during initial evaluation, which fits with restricting autoimmune serology to the high-suspicion phenotype rather than blanket screening [^114T7wRv] [^111JYUVe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost added GPCR autoantibodies for POTS to the screening list, but I should double-check whether guidelines endorse that. Although elevated GPCR autoantibodies have been reported in POTS cohorts, these assays are not currently guideline-endorsed for diagnostic screening and routine POTS evaluation instead prioritizes identifying secondary causes with basic labs rather than autoimmune serology, so I will not recommend GPCR autoantibody testing as part of standard dysautonomia screening outside research contexts [^115yPhUU] [^113gbTQU].

> Let me ensure the role of autonomic function testing is clear so we do not misplace these antibodies as standalone diagnostics. Serologic testing should complement, not replace, objective autonomic function assessment such as deep-breathing, Valsalva, and tilt or active stand testing to document neurogenic patterns, ideally performed and interpreted by clinicians with expertise in autonomic disorders to avoid misclassification and to guide downstream management [^117SNg5M] [^111nFouq] [^113hAgmS].

> I should confirm the downstream steps once a result returns. Positive paraneoplastic antibodies should trigger age- and risk-adjusted cancer evaluation and multidisciplinary oncology referral, whereas positive anti–ganglionic AChR antibodies support an immune-mediated autonomic neuropathy where early consideration of immunotherapy may be appropriate; however, I need to note that seronegative AAG exists, so a negative antibody panel does not exclude autoimmune etiologies when the phenotype remains compelling, warranting continued clinical vigilance and sometimes repeat testing as the syndrome evolves [^113ZTfCR] [^1139PUZq].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable recommendation is as follows, and let me reconsider each element for internal consistency. In patients with acute or subacute onset multidomain autonomic failure, obtain serum anti–ganglionic nicotinic AChR antibodies and a paraneoplastic antibody panel that includes at minimum anti-Hu, expanding to other relevant onconeural antibodies based on phenotype and cancer risk factors, while reserving such testing in chronic neurodegenerative or isolated orthostatic intolerance presentations where the pretest probability of autoimmune dysautonomia is low; integrate results with formal autonomic testing and, if positive, proceed with oncologic evaluation or immunotherapy pathways as indicated, recognizing that negative serology does not categorically exclude autoimmune disease in this context [^113ZTfCR] [^115R1Bpj] [^114T7wRv] [^113hAgmS].

Autoimmune screening in dysautonomia focuses on identifying **treatable immune-mediated causes** [^115fYbXB]. The **key autoimmune tests** are anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (α3-AChR) antibodies for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy [^113ZTfCR], and paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-CV2/CRMP5, anti-Ri, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) when a paraneoplastic process is suspected [^115R1Bpj]. Additional screening includes ANA, ENA panel, anti-dsDNA, ANCA, anti-SSA/SSB, anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-GAD65 to evaluate for systemic autoimmune diseases that can cause autonomic dysfunction [^115fYbXB]. These tests should be interpreted in clinical context and combined with autonomic function testing (tilt table, Valsalva, QSART) to confirm dysautonomia and guide management [^113cTiJ2] [^111nFouq].

---

## Indications for autoimmune screening in dysautonomia

Autoimmune screening is indicated when clinical features suggest an **immune-mediated** process — particularly with **subacute onset** or systemic features [^113ZTfCR]:

- **Subacute onset**: Rapid progression over days to weeks.
- **Multidomain involvement**: Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, sudomotor, and pupillomotor domains.
- **Systemic features**: Weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms.
- **Paraneoplastic suspicion**: History or suspicion of malignancy [^115R1Bpj].
- **Autoimmune history**: Personal or family history of autoimmune disease.

---

## Recommended autoimmune screening laboratories

The following autoimmune tests are recommended for patients with **suspected autoimmune dysautonomia**:

| **Autoantibody test** | **Clinical relevance** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (α3-AChR) antibodies | Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) [^111yfNLF] | - Subacute autonomic failure <br/> - Suspected AAG |
| Paraneoplastic antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-CV2/CRMP5, anti-Ri, anti-Ma2, anti-amphiphysin) | Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy [^115R1Bpj] | - Suspected paraneoplastic syndrome <br/> - Malignancy |
| Antinuclear antibody (ANA) | Systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, Sjögren's) [^115fYbXB] | General autoimmune screening |
| Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel (SSA, SSB, RNP, Sm, Scl-70, Jo-1) | Specific systemic autoimmune diseases [^115fYbXB] | Suspected connective tissue disease |
| Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) | Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | Suspected SLE |
| Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) | Vasculitis | Suspected vasculitis |
| Anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin) | Autoimmune thyroid disease | Suspected thyroid dysfunction |
| Anti-GAD65 antibodies | - Autoimmune diabetes <br/> - Stiff-person syndrome | - Suspected autoimmune diabetes <br/> - Neurological syndromes |

---

## Additional laboratory evaluations

In addition to autoimmune screening, obtain the following tests to identify **secondary causes** of dysautonomia:

- **CBC**: Evaluate for anemia or infection.
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride.
- **Renal function**: Creatinine, urea.
- **TSH**: Thyroid dysfunction.
- **Morning cortisol**: Adrenal insufficiency.
- **Ferritin**: Iron deficiency [^113gbTQU].

---

## Autonomic function testing

Autonomic function testing is **essential** to confirm dysautonomia and determine severity [^115fQ2XR]:

- **Tilt table testing**: Orthostatic intolerance, POTS, orthostatic hypotension [^111atDea].
- **Valsalva maneuver**: Baroreflex function [^112CozYj].
- **QSART**: Sudomotor function [^113cTiJ2].
- **Heart rate variability**: Cardiovagal function [^117SNg5M].

---

## Clinical implications of positive autoimmune screening

Positive autoimmune screening results guide **targeted therapy** — including immunotherapy (IVIG, plasma exchange, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants) — for autoimmune dysautonomia [^115fYbXB]. They also prompt paraneoplastic evaluation with appropriate cancer screening and oncologic management [^115R1Bpj] and direct management of associated systemic autoimmune diseases via rheumatology or endocrinology referral [^1139PUZq].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Autoimmune screening can yield **false positives** — low-titer antibodies may be nonspecific — and **false negatives**, as not all autoimmune dysautonomias have detectable antibodies. Results must be interpreted in clinical context for accurate diagnosis and management.

---

Autoimmune screening in dysautonomia includes anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, paraneoplastic antibodies, and general autoimmune panels. These tests, combined with autonomic function testing, help **identify treatable autoimmune causes** and guide management [^113ZTfCR].

### The spectrum of immune-mediated autonomic neuropathies: Insights from the clinicopathological features [^111yfNLF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Although autonomic neuropathy may occur as a secondary consequence of various diseases, some patients without any obvious underlying diseases exhibit profound autonomic dysfunctions from the early phase of the disease. These idiopathic or primary cases are classified into pure autonomic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy with sensory impairment, and autonomic neuropathy with sensory and motor impairment, based on the presence or absence of sensory and motor dysfunctions. The discovery of the antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody has suggested the involvement of immune mechanisms in idiopathic cases, particularly in those with pure autonomic neuropathy.

The ability to test for this antibody has significantly broadened the concept of autonomic neuropathy to include cases with a chronic progressive course that mimic pure autonomic failure. Recent research based on antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody testing has established autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy as an isolated nosological entity. Other forms of primary autonomic neuropathies include acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy and acute autonomic sensory and motor neuropathy. However, the nosological relationship of the latter to Guillain-Barré syndrome merits discussion.

While the possibility of infectious, metabolic, or toxic etiologies should be carefully excluded in these forms of autonomic neuropathy, the monophasic clinical course and antecedent infections suggest the involvement of immune mechanisms similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Neuronopathy in the autonomic ganglia is evident in these cases.

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions estimated to affect 70 million people worldwide. The cardiovascular ANS is the most frequently affected domain, with an incidence of a first-in-life syncope episode of 6.2 per 1000 person-years. In contrast to other neurological disciplines, the evaluation of the ANS is associated with special caveats. Since on most occasions the ANS cannot be tested directly, its assessment relies on examining noninvasive physiological variables that express not only the activity of the autonomic reflex arc, but also the function of the effector organ and interaction of the body with external physical stimuli.

The evaluation is extensive and time-consuming, and test batteries typically include the head-up tilt test, the Valsalva maneuver, and deep breathing for the evaluation of sympathetic adrenergic and cardiovagal function. Additionally, tests such as the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), thermoregulatory sweat test, sympathetic skin response, and electrochemical skin conductance measurement are used for the evaluation of sudomotor function.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^111Nky6H]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cardiovascular dysautonomia are a common occurrence in Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to this dysautonomia as part of PD itself, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be triggered as a side effect of drug treatment interacting with the ANS or — if prominent and early — an indication of a different disease such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure. While autonomic function tests can differentiate parasympathetic from sympathetic dysfunction, cardiac imaging can define the pathophysiologically involved site of a lesion. Standard tests such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements can identify significant autonomic failure which needs treatment.

The most frequent and disturbing symptom of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms include generalized weakness, lightheadedness, and mental "clouding", up to syncope. Factors like heat, food, alcohol, exercise, activities that increase intrathoracic pressure (e.g. defecation, coughing), and certain drugs (e.g. vasodilators) can worsen a probably asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Non-medical and medical therapies can help the patient to cope with disabling symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Supine hypertension is often associated with orthostatic hypotension. The prognostic role of cardiovagal and baroreflex dysfunction is still not yet known.

### Cardiovascular autonomic testing in extrapyramidal disorders [^114FFzns]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Various diagnostic tests are available to demonstrate autonomic failure in extrapyramidal disease. Autonomic function tests can identify parasympathetic and sympathetic dysfunction. While specialized tests are only available in autonomic labs, routine tests such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements can be broadly used in clinical practice, e.g. as screening tests. In this review, we briefly introduce functional cardiovascular autonomic testing and propose a workup plan for patients with extrapyramidal disease. In all patients with extrapyramidal disease, screening for autonomic dysfunction should be performed. In the case of pathological findings, detailed autonomic testing should be considered with repeated measurements at follow-up visits.

### Autonomic dysfunction in genetic forms of synucleinopathies [^112UzCXK]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The discovery of genetic links between alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease (PD) has opened unprecedented opportunities for research into a new group of diseases, now collectively known as synucleinopathies. Autonomic dysfunction, including cardiac sympathetic denervation, has been reported in familial forms of synucleinopathies that have Lewy bodies at the core of their pathogenesis. Mutations and multiplications in the SNCA gene, as well as LRRK2 disease with Lewy bodies, along with other common sporadic forms such as idiopathic PD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure, and dementia with Lewy bodies, have all been associated with dysautonomia. By contrast, in familial cases of parkinsonism without Lewy bodies, such as in PARK2, the autonomic profile remains normal throughout the course of the disease.

The degeneration of the central and peripheral autonomic systems in both genetic and sporadic forms of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies correlates with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive-containing inclusions. Given that dysautonomia has a significant impact on the quality of life of sufferers and autonomic symptoms are generally treatable, prompt diagnostic testing and treatment should be provided. Moreover, new evidence suggests that autonomic dysfunction can be used as an outcome prediction factor in some forms of synucleinopathies or as premotor diagnostic markers that could be used in the future to define further research avenues. In this review, we describe the autonomic dysfunction of genetic synucleinopathies in comparison to the dysautonomia of sporadic forms of alpha-synuclein accumulation.

### Cardiovascular autonomic testing in the work-up of cerebellar ataxia: Insight from an observational single center study [^112h7Mqf]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular autonomic function tests were performed in a quiet room at a constant temperature, following a standardized protocol of our laboratory, which has been described in detail elsewhere. These tests included the following procedures: 10 minutes of supine rest, 10 minutes of 60° head-up tilt, 5 minutes of supine rest, 5 minutes of active standing, deep breathing, and the Valsalva maneuver. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded using a CNSystem device (CNSystem Medizintechnik GmbH, Graz, Austria) with biosignals analyzed via customized software by JPN.

- **Cardiovascular autonomic function tests: Evaluation**: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was diagnosed according to the aforementioned consensus criteria. The neurogenic nature of OH was corroborated by a blunted or absent increase in heart rate upon tilting and the absence of BP overshoot in phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver. Even in the absence of OH, several signs at these tests may suggest incipient autonomic failure. These include impaired HR counter-regulation during deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver, as well as delayed OH. As a further possible sign of incipient dysautonomia, we also considered falls in BP at 3 minutes of orthostatic challenge, which did not meet the requirements for an OH diagnosis.

- **Follow-up**: Patients were regularly followed up at intervals of 3–12 months. Sporadic cases were monitored concerning possible or probable conversion to multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C).

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^113D1zKx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse, and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed.

Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6 min, which dropped to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 min of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction.

The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100 mg, two times per day; titrated to 100 mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1 year of follow-up.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^11377MPW]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2005, the ANS panel of the European Federation of Neurological Societies conducted a survey on the distribution of ANS laboratories in Europe, asking for information on applied methods and equipment, the existence of their own normative data, commercial versus self‐developed systems, and research and educational activities. Although this survey included all types of ANS laboratories (i.e. cardiological, endocrinological, etc) and not only neurologically oriented ANS laboratories, it pinpointed a high heterogeneity in ANS services across Europe and, most importantly, large diversities in the techniques used to investigate ANS disorders, altogether highlighting an unmet need for ANS testing standards across European countries.

Recently, many efforts have been made to standardize the clinical assessment of the ANS. Consensus definitions have been published to diagnose key aspects of cardiovascular autonomic failure, such as orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. The European Federation of Autonomic Societies (EFAS), endorsed by the American Autonomic Society (AAS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), provided recommendations on the use of tilt table testing in the diagnosis of disorders that may cause transient loss of consciousness. The AAS and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) released definitions of autonomic disorders and methodological guidance for appropriate autonomic function testing. The latter consensus statement emphasized the importance of evaluating the ANS with screening batteries encompassing tests of sympathetic adrenergic.

### Autonomic function testing in Friedreich's ataxia [^1164U4xN]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we show that FRDA patients may experience autonomic symptoms from multiple domains, and the overall burden of dysautonomia correlates with disease severity. At clinical testing, sudomotor and cardiovascular autonomic function were largely preserved. Furthermore, a contribution of additional determinants such as deconditioning and subclinical cardiomyopathy is hypothesized concerning higher heart rate values and pathological blood pressure fall in some patients.

Our results suggest that clinical assessment of autonomic symptoms should be performed routinely in FRDA patients. To this concern, the SCOPA-Aut appears to be a useful tool that may potentially capture the nature and progression of autonomic symptoms and/or improvements after symptomatic treatment.

Future studies should address autonomic symptoms in larger cohorts and potentially investigate the neuropathological correlates of these findings.

### Clinical reasoning: A 72-year-old man with progressive pan-dysautonomia [^115zUuCh]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Dysautonomia is a common clinical feature among many central and peripheral neurologic disorders. Evaluation of patients with dysautonomia can be challenging in the absence of a previously established neurologic diagnosis. In this case, we discuss a 72-year-old man who presented with 9 months of progressive dysautonomia, including orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and constipation. A combination of autonomic testing and serologic testing confirmed the final diagnosis. This case highlights the differential diagnosis of autonomic failure, emphasizing the role of specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging cues in guiding clinical reasoning.

### Heart rate variability tests for diagnosing cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in advanced stages of kidney disease [^112JmwjR]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is one of the diabetes neuropathies and represents the most prevalent, underdiagnosed, and undertreated diabetes complication. CAN is a degenerative condition that affects 16.7–34.3% of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). It has a multifactorial pathogenesis related to diabetes duration, poor glycemic control, and, more recently, hypertension.

Early diagnosis of CAN is a key factor in managing this condition, as slowing its progression is associated with a better quality of life and prognosis. The signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy should be carefully investigated since they generally appear in late stages and are usually represented by a nonspecific clinic, such as tachycardia, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and erectile dysfunction.

The gold standard for diagnosis is cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs). These tests assess autonomic function through provocative maneuvers (lying to standing, deep breathing, and Valsalva maneuver) that analyze heart rate and blood pressure. CARTs may expose patients to risks related to increasing intrathoracic, intraocular, and intracranial pressure and may theoretically be associated with a small risk of intraocular hemorrhage or lens dislocation. These complications could have their frequency increased in more debilitated patients with other diabetes complications, especially diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

DKD is a chronic microvascular complication of DM that affects up to 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease.

### Dysautonomia following COVID-19 is not associated with subjective limitations or symptoms but is associated with objective functional limitations [^111DRXh5]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals who contract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can suffer persistent and debilitating symptoms long after the initial acute illness. Heart rate (HR) profiles determined during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and delivered as part of a post-COVID recovery service may provide insight into the presence and impact of dysautonomia on functional ability.

The study focused on an active, working-age, post-COVID-19 population with the purpose to (1) determine and characterize any association between subjective symptoms and dysautonomia and (2) identify objective exercise capacity differences between patients classified "with" and those "without" dysautonomia.

- **Methods**: Patients referred to a post-COVID-19 service underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, including self-reported symptoms, CPET, and secondary care investigations when indicated. Resting HR was noted, including patients with a resting HR > 75 bpm and HR increase with exercise. Those with dysautonomia demonstrated objective functional limitations, showing significantly reduced work rate (219 ± 37 W vs 253 ± 52 W; P < 0.001) and peak oxygen consumption (V̇o 2: 30.6 ± 5.5 mL/kg/min vs 35.8 ± 7.6 mL/kg/min; P < 0.001).

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^116cfC2q]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Parkinson's disease, specifically the management of autonomic dysfunction, the CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend several strategies. Advise patients to avoid coffee before bedtime and limit water ingestion to manage urinary urgency and incontinence, and exclude urinary tract infections (UTI) when symptoms appear suddenly.

- **Reduce intake of fluid after 6 pm**: Sleep with a head-up tilt of the bed to reduce urine production and control nocturia.

- **Optimize nighttime dopaminergic therapy**: Ensure the effectiveness of the treatment throughout the night.

- **Administer anticholinergic or antispasmodic drugs**: Use these for urinary urgency (overactive bladder), taking care to consider potential central adverse effects.

- **Administer botulinum toxin type A injection**: Target the detrusor muscle when necessary.

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic dizziness [^112L63pT]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

The goals of this study were to validate the clinical diagnosis of autonomic dizziness as a cause of chronic nonvertiginous dizziness that may be exacerbated by physical exertion or orthostatic challenges, estimate its prevalence in a tertiary referral population, and investigate the usefulness of three autonomic challenges as objective tests for this condition.

- **Study design**: Laboratory investigation of autonomic activity.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care balance center.

- **Patients**: Fifteen men and women with symptoms indicative of autonomic dizziness. Subjects with other causes of dizziness, histories of syncope, or psychiatric disorders were excluded.

- **Interventions**: Autonomic tests included 45 minutes of head upright tilt (HUT), 20 minutes of 5% CO2 inhalation followed by HUT, and 2 minutes of voluntary hyperventilation followed by HUT.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patterns of cardiovascular and respiratory responses and subjective ratings of dizziness, autonomic symptoms, and anxiety during autonomic challenges.

Twelve subjects had evidence of autonomic dysfunction, including ten with abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory responses to HUT. Two other subjects had prolonged hypocarbia after voluntary hyperventilation. Many of these abnormalities would have been missed by autonomic testing paradigms. In one subject, CO2 inhalation revealed latent anxiety. In two subjects, the presence of high symptom ratings without objective autonomic dysfunction prompted a successful search for other diagnoses.

### Clinical autonomic nervous system laboratories in Europe: A joint survey of the European Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Autonomic Societies [^114LbKQx]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common conditions, but it is unclear whether access to ANS healthcare provision is homogeneous across European countries. The aim of this study was to identify neurology-driven or interdisciplinary clinical ANS laboratories in Europe, describe their characteristics, and explore regional differences.

- **Methods**: We contacted the European national ANS and neurological societies, as well as members of our professional network, to identify clinical ANS laboratories in each country and invite them to answer a web-based survey.

- **Results**: We identified 84 laboratories in 22 countries, and 46 (55%) answered the survey. All laboratories perform cardiovascular autonomic function tests, and 83% also perform sweat tests. Testing for catecholamines and autoantibodies are performed in 63% and 56% of laboratories, and epidermal nerve fiber density analysis in 63%. Each laboratory is staffed by a median of two consultants, one resident, one technician, and one nurse. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of head-up tilt tests per laboratory per year is 105 (49–251). Reflex syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are the most frequently diagnosed cardiovascular ANS disorders. Thirty-five centers (76%) have an ANS outpatient clinic, with a median (IQR) of 200 (100–360) outpatient visits per year; 42 centers (91%) also offer inpatient care (median 20 [IQR 4–110] inpatient stays per year). Forty-one laboratories (89%) are involved in research activities. We observed a significant difference in the geographical distribution of clinical ANS laboratories in Europe.

Testing for catecholamines and autoantibodies are conducted in 63% and 56% of laboratories, respectively, with epidermal nerve fiber density analysis in 63%. Each laboratory is staffed by a median of two consultants, one resident, one technician, and one nurse. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of head-up tilt tests per laboratory per year is 105 (49–251).

- **Results**: Reflex syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are the most frequently diagnosed cardiovascular ANS disorders. Thirty-five centers (76%) have an ANS outpatient clinic, with a median (IQR) of 200 (100–360) outpatient visits per year. Additionally, 42 centers (91%) offer inpatient care with a median of 20 (IQR 4–110) inpatient stays per year. Forty-one laboratories (89%) are involved in research activities.

We observed a significant difference in the geographical distribution of ANS laboratories across Europe.

### Autonomic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: tools for assessment and review of the literature [^114zysmG]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is very common in patients with dementia, and its presence might also help in differential diagnosis among dementia subtypes. Various central nervous system structures affected in Alzheimer's disease are also implicated in autonomic nervous system regulation, and it has been hypothesized that the deficit in central cholinergic function observed in Alzheimer's disease could likely lead to autonomic dysfunction. Several feasible tests can be used in clinical practice for the assessment of parasympathetic and sympathetic functions, especially in terms of cardiovascular autonomic modulation.

In this review, we describe the different tests available and the evidence from the literature which indicate a definite presence of autonomic dysfunction in dementia at various degrees. Importantly, the recognition of dysautonomia, besides possibly being an early marker of dementia, would help prevent the disabling complications which increase the risk of morbidity, institutionalization, and mortality in these individuals.

### The clinical approach to autonomic failure in neurological disorders [^115fYbXB]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Central or peripheral neurological disorders can manifest with autonomic failure or autonomic hyperactivity, which may affect the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and/or enteric nervous systems. Disorders causing autonomic failure can be classified according to the presence or absence of associated neurological manifestations, such as peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonism, and their temporal profile (acute or subacute, chronic progressive, static, or episodic). A systematic approach allows for focused evaluation to detect treatable, potentially disabling, or life-threatening conditions.

Subacute isolated autonomic failure affecting sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system function, in various combinations, occurs in autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, which might be the first manifestation of an underlying neoplasm. Autonomic failure can be an important feature of several types of peripheral neuropathy, including sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies, sensory ganglionopathy, and distal painful peripheral neuropathies. Progressive autonomic failure occurs in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disorders. Autonomic failure may also occur in hereditary leukoencephalopathies or prion disorders.

This review outlines the clinical approach to patients with generalized autonomic failure, focusing predominantly on classification and diagnosis, but also touching briefly on treatment and management.

### Autonomic syncope in pediatrics: A practice-oriented approach to classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^115aqomi]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This paper presents a practice-oriented approach to the problem of syncope in pediatrics. Autonomic syncope is the major etiologic category in pediatrics and consists of two types: reflex and dysautonomic. The latter type is rare in pediatrics. Reflex syncope has four subtypes: neurocardiogenic, central, situational, and cerebral.

Neurocardiogenic syncope, the most common subtype, is easily diagnosed by taking a careful, detailed history; identifying diagnostic red flags; performing a complete physical examination; and ordering a minimum of laboratory tests. Patient and parent education is essential, and usually, without medication, outcomes are good.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome — current experience and concepts [^114VvGBj]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young, aged between 15 and 40 years, and predominantly female.

The symptoms, including palpitations, dizziness, and occasionally syncope, mainly occur when the patient is standing upright and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion, and heat, are recognized to exacerbate the symptoms. The onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery, or stress.

PoTS can be associated with various other disorders, particularly joint hypermobility syndrome, also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome as well as investigational treatments.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic neuropathy, specifically in terms of clinical assessment, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing for symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy. These include orthostatic dizziness, syncope, resting tachycardia, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities. It is advised to start assessments at diagnosis and continue at least annually thereafter in patients with evidence of other microvascular complications, particularly kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Autonomic nervous system dysfunction: JACC focus seminar [^112tDok8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system control of the heart is a dynamic process in both health and disease. A multilevel neural network is responsible for the control of chronotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy, and inotropy. Intrinsic autonomic dysfunction arises from diseases that directly affect the autonomic nerves, such as diabetes mellitus and the syndromes of primary autonomic failure. Extrinsic autonomic dysfunction reflects the changes in autonomic function that are secondarily induced by cardiac or other diseases.

An array of tests interrogates various aspects of cardiac autonomic control, either in resting conditions or with physiological perturbations from resting conditions. The prognostic significance of these assessments has been well established. However, clinical usefulness has not been established, and the precise mechanistic link to mortality is less well established.

Further efforts are required to develop optimal approaches to delineate cardiac autonomic dysfunction and its adverse effects to develop tools that can be used to guide clinical decision-making.

### Autonomic nervous system evaluation of patients with vasomotor rhinitis [^111hKDuW]. The Laryngoscope (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to demonstrate the utility of quantitative neurological laboratory testing in autonomic nervous system dysfunction and to apply this methodology to further study the relation of chronic vasomotor (nonallergic) rhinitis to the autonomic nervous system.

- **Methods**: It has been suspected that vasomotor rhinitis is due either to a hyperactive parasympathetic nervous system or an imbalance between it and the sympathetic nervous system. The exact relation has not been determined. Recently, neurological laboratories have been developed in which a battery of tests can be performed to determine the reactivity of the autonomic nervous system.

- **Results**: Autonomic nervous system testing was performed on 19 patients with symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for vasomotor rhinitis, and the results were compared with 75 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Patients with vasomotor rhinitis had significant abnormalities in their sudomotor, cardiovagal, and adrenergic subscores. Their composite autonomic scale score was significantly impaired at 2.43, as compared with 0.11 for controls (P < .005).

- **Conclusion**: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is significant in patients with vasomotor rhinitis. Possible factors that trigger this dysfunction, including nasal trauma and extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux, are discussed.

### Cardiovascular autonomic function tests in an African population [^1137vEkp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Dysautonomia usually begins with impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system, followed by damage to the sympathetic nervous system. This process is patchy, with increasing involvement of both systems. Therefore, a variety of tests assessing the function of both nervous systems are suggested. Our study included five non-invasive and easy-to-use autonomic function tests.

The Valsalva manoeuvre and sustained handgrip test were not included, even though they are common autonomic function tests. The Valsalva manoeuvre may be associated with intraocular haemorrhage and dislocation of the lens, while the sustained handgrip test ideally requires a handgrip dynamometer and continuous blood pressure recording, which is often not available in resource-poor settings. Both tests require good communication and depend on patient cooperation.

In our test battery, we added resting heart rate (HR) and postural changes in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) — two tests that are suitable for resource-poor circumstances — to the more commonly used tests of heart rate variation in response to deep breathing, HR response to standing, and postural changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Reduced parasympathetic activity causes resting tachycardia; thus, this test is associated with cardiovascular autonomic failure.

Postural changes in SBP and DBP are included in the criteria for defining orthostatic hypotension by the Consensus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology. In autonomic function test batteries, the postural change in SBP is usually included. Postural change in DBP is used less commonly.

### Quantitative studies of autonomic function [^113cTiJ2]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the peripheral and central autonomic nervous system is common in many neurological and general medical diseases. The quantitative assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic function is essential to confirm the diagnosis of autonomic failure, provide the basis for follow-up examinations, and potentially to monitor successful treatment. Various procedures have been described as useful tools to quantify autonomic dysfunction. The most important tests evaluate cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic function.

In this review, we focus on standard tests of cardiovascular and sudomotor function such as heart-rate variability at rest and during deep breathing, active standing, the Valsalva maneuver, and the sympathetic skin response. These tests are widely used for routine clinical evaluation in patients with peripheral neuropathies.

Refined methods of studying heart-rate variability, baroreflex testing, and detailed measures of sweat output are mostly used for research purposes. In this context, we describe the spectral analysis of slow modulation of heart rate or blood pressure, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, and consider various approaches to baroreflex testing, the thermoregulatory sweat test, and the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test.

Finally, we discuss microneurography as a technique of direct recording of muscle sympathetic nerve activity.

### Parkinson's disease outside the brain: targeting the autonomic nervous system [^117NsBRQ]. The Lancet Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with Parkinson's disease present with signs and symptoms of dysregulation of the peripheral autonomic nervous system that can even precede motor deficits. This dysregulation might reflect early pathology and therefore could be targeted for the development of prodromal or diagnostic biomarkers. Only a few objective clinical tests assess disease progression and evaluate the entire spectrum of autonomic dysregulation in patients with Parkinson's disease.

However, results from epidemiological studies and findings from new animal models suggest that the dysfunctional autonomic nervous system is a probable route by which Parkinson's disease pathology can spread both to and from the CNS. The autonomic innervation of the gut, heart, and skin is affected by α-synuclein pathology in the early stages of the disease and might initiate α-synuclein spread via the autonomic connectome to the CNS. The development of easy-to-use and reliable clinical tests of autonomic nervous system function seems crucial for early diagnosis, and for developing strategies to stop or prevent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.

- **Discontinue drugs associated with erectile dysfunction**: Such as α-blockers or anorgasmia-inducing SSRIs. Recognize that dopaminergic therapy can have both negative and positive effects on this symptom.

- **Consider offering sildenafil**: Administer 50–100 mg 1 hour before sexual activity for patients with erectile dysfunction.

- **Consider alternative drugs**: Tadalafil 10 mg 30 minutes to 12 hours before sex, or vardenafil 10 mg 1 hour before sex can be offered as alternative choices.

- **Consider apomorphine injections**: Administer 5–10 minutes before sexual activity as an alternative option for some patients.

- **Consider intracavernous injections**: Papaverine or alprostadil may be administered in selected patients.

### Dysautonomias: Clinical disorders of the autonomic nervous system [^113vL47U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. These changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases. They include disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role, as well as disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state. The conditions vary from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities.

In chronic autonomic failure — such as pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson's disease — orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure due to sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after "patchy" autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion. It can also result from a primary abnormality that augments the delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart.

Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys appears to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, justifying treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between these conditions.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^114LYqVk]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Autonomic function testing was performed to determine whether the orthostatic hypotension (OH) was neurogenic in origin. Tilt table testing revealed a blood pressure (BP) drop from 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 bpm) after 6 minutes in the supine position to 76/60 mm Hg (heart rate, 83 bpm) within 2 minutes of tilt to the 80° head-up position. This BP drop was accompanied by dizziness and weakness at 2 minutes of tilt and presyncope at 4 minutes of tilt. Continuous recording with transcranial Doppler during tilt testing indicated no changes in mean cerebral blood flow.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings during the heart rate with deep breathing test (paced breathing at six breaths per minute) showed an expiration/inhalation ratio of 1.02, which is abnormal for the patient's age and sex, indicating depressed baseline autonomic tone and decreased vagal tone. Valsalva testing (measured at 40 mm Hg) revealed a Valsalva ratio of 1.15, which is also abnormal for the patient's age and sex. Taken together, the results of autonomic testing were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) for this patient.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension.

Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### The phoenix from the ashes: Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia [^113dQ3Yc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with autonomic failure may experience postural dizziness, syncope, and falls. Identifying symptomatic dysautonomia in dementia is important to ensure appropriate management and reduce the risk of falls.

- **Objective**: The aim of this prospective study is to identify cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients suffering from the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

- **Methods**: Patients were prospectively recruited from 2009 until 2013. Clinical autonomic function tests were carried out in an Autonomic Unit according to Ewing's cardiovascular battery. Parasympathetic tests included resting heart rate variability, deep breathing, and Valsalva. Sympathetic function tests comprised blood pressure regulation on Valsalva, cutaneous cold stimulation, and 70° head-up tilt, including plasma noradrenaline.

- **Results**: Twenty-six patients (17 female) with bvFTD and 18 patients (10 female) with AD were examined. The mean age of bvFTD patients was 69 ± 11 years, and AD patients 74 ± 9 years. History taking was often not conclusive and did not correlate with autonomic signs. In 42% of bvFTD patients and 44% of AD patients, autonomic dysfunction was demonstrated. Manifest orthostatic hypotension (OH) was present in 19% of bvFTD and 33% of AD patients. The frequency of autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension did not differ between bvFTD and AD but were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Autonomic dysfunction was associated with an increased risk of falling, assessed using the Tinetti Score.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first prospective study to explore cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients with bvFTD compared to AD. Results indicate a similar prevalence of dysfunction between the two patient groups, underscoring the need for focused management strategies to mitigate fall risks.

### Autonomic dysfunction presenting as orthostatic intolerance in patients suffering from mitochondrial cytopathy [^111USdxb]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Disturbances in autonomic nervous system function have been reported to occur in patients suffering from mitochondrial cytopathies. However, there is a paucity of literature on the occurrence of orthostatic intolerance (OI) in these patients. We report on a series of patients diagnosed with mitochondrial cytopathy who developed features of autonomic dysfunction in the form of OI.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center report on a series of 6 patients who were followed in our clinic for orthostatic intolerance. All of these patients had a diagnosis of mitochondrial cytopathy based on muscle biopsy and were being followed at a center specializing in the treatment of mitochondrial disorders. This study was approved by our local institutional review board. Each of the patients had suffered from symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, near syncope, and syncope. The diagnosis of OI was confirmed by a head-up tilt test. Collected data included demographic information, presenting symptoms, laboratory data, tilt-table response, and treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: Six patients (3 females) were identified for inclusion in this report. The mean age of the group was 48 ± 8 years (range, 40–60 years). All of these patients underwent head-up tilt table testing and all had a positive response that reproduced their clinical symptoms. Among those having an abnormal tilt-table pattern, 1 had a neurocardiogenic response, 1 had a dysautonomic response, and 4 had a postural orthostatic tachycardia response. All but 1 patient reported marked symptom relief with pharmacotherapy.

### Autonomic dysfunction in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [^116eTcDB]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Autonomic deficits in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) have not been adequately quantitated. The Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) is a validated instrument for laboratory quantitation of autonomic failure derived from standard autonomic reflex tests. We characterized dysautonomia in CIDP using CASS.

- **Methods**: Autonomic function was retrospectively analyzed in 47 patients meeting CIDP criteria. CASS ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (pandysautonomia), reflecting summation of sudomotor (0–3), cardiovagal (0–3), and adrenergic (0–4) subscores. Severity of neurologic deficits was measured with the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). The degree of small fiber involvement was assessed with quantitative sensation testing. The thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) was available in 8 patients.

- **Results**: Patients (25 men) were middle-aged (45.0 ± 14.9 years) with longstanding CIDP (3.5 ± 4.3 years) of moderate severity (NIS, 46.5 ± 32.7). Autonomic symptoms were uncommon, mainly gastrointestinal (9/47; 19%) and genitourinary (8/47; 17%). Autonomic deficits (CASS ≥ 1) were frequent (22/47; 47%) but very mild (CASS, 0.8 ± 0.9; CASS ≤ 3, all cases). Deficits were predominantly sudomotor (16/47; 34%) and cardiovagal (10/47; 21%) with relative adrenergic sparing (4/47; 9%). TST was abnormal in 5 of 8 patients (anhidrosis range, 2%-59%). Sudomotor impairment was predominantly distal and postganglionic. Somatic deficits (disease duration, severity, small fiber deficits) did not predict the presence of autonomic deficits.

- **Conclusion**: Our data characterize the autonomic dysfunction in CIDP patients.

### Proper performance of autonomic function testing [^113hAgmS]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this position statement is to provide a recommendation from experts at the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) on the proper performance of autonomic testing.

- **Methods**: The AANEM Professional Practice Committee and selected AANEM members reached a consensus based on expert opinion on the training required to perform autonomic testing and the appropriate performance of such tests.

- **Results**: Individuals without sufficient medical education in autonomic disorders are unqualified to interpret the data generated or to coordinate the findings with other clinical information in order to reach a clinical diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: The AANEM strongly recommends that autonomic testing procedures be performed by physicians with comprehensive knowledge of neurologic and autonomic disorders to ensure precise interpretation and diagnosis at the completion of the testing. The same physician should obtain a relevant history and physical examination and should directly supervise and interpret the data on-site and in real time.

### High incidence of autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID: Implications for management and health care planning [^111gJBNc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), has been reported in individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). However, the degree of dysautonomia in PASC has not been compared to those with POTS and healthy controls.

- **Methods**: All participants were prospectively enrolled between August 5, 2021, and October 31, 2022. Autonomic testing included beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitoring to assess respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Valsalva ratio, and orthostatic changes during a 10-minute active standing test, as well as sudomotor assessment. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31) was used to assess symptoms, and the EuroQuol 5-Dimension survey (EQ-5D-5L) was employed to evaluate health-related quality of life (HrQoL) measures.

- **Results**: A total of 99 participants (n = 33 PASC, n = 33 POTS, and n = 33 healthy controls; median age 32 years, 85.9% females) were included. Compared with healthy controls, the PASC and POTS cohorts demonstrated significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (P < .001), greater heart rate increase during the 10-minute active standing test (P < .001), greater burden of autonomic dysfunction as evidenced by higher COMPASS-31 scores across all subdomains (all P < .001), and poor HrQoL across all EQ-5D-5L domains (all P < .001), lower median EuroQol-visual analogue scale (P < .001), and lower utility scores (P < .001). The majority (79%) of those with PASC met the internationally established criteria for POTS.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of autonomic symptomatology for POTS was high in those with PASC.

### Dysautonomia in anti-Hu paraneoplastic neurological syndromes [^115R1Bpj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Dysautonomia has been associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS)-related mortality in anti-Hu PNS, but its frequency and spectrum remain ill-defined. This study describes anti-Hu patients with dysautonomia, estimates its frequency, and compares them to patients without dysautonomia.

- **Methods**: Patients with anti-Hu antibodies diagnosed in the study center (1990–2022) were retrospectively reviewed, and those with autonomic signs and symptoms were identified.

- **Results**: Among 477 anti-Hu patients, 126 (26%) had dysautonomia, with dysautonomia being the only PNS manifestation in 7 of these 126 cases (6%). The manifestations included gastrointestinal (82/126, 65%), cardiovascular (64/126, 51%), urogenital (24/126, 19%), pupillomotor/secretomotor (each, 11/126, 9%), and central hypoventilation (10/126, 8%). Patients with isolated CNS involvement less frequently had gastrointestinal dysautonomia than those with peripheral (alone or combined with CNS) involvement (7/23, 30% vs. 31/44, 70% vs. 37/52, 71%; P = 0.002), while they more frequently exhibited central hypoventilation (7/23, 30% vs. 1/44, 2.3% vs. 2/52, 4%; P < 0.001) and/or cardiovascular alterations (18/23, 78% vs. 20/44, 45% vs. 26/52, 50%; P = 0.055). Median [95% CI] overall survival was not significantly different between patients with (37 [17; 91] months) or without dysautonomia (28 [22; 39] months; P = 0.78). Cardiovascular dysautonomia (HR: 1.57, 95% CI [1.05; 2.36]; P = 0.030) and central hypoventilation (HR: 3.51, 95% CI [1.54; 8.01]; P = 0.003) were associated with a higher risk of death, whereas secretomotor dysautonomia was associated with a lower risk (HR: 0.28, 95% CI [0.09; 0.89]; P = 0.032).

### Association between neurosarcoidosis with autonomic dysfunction and anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies [^111S8Qdp]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We described three cases of neurosarcoidosis with dysautonomia, including anti-gAChR-positive cases, and systematically reviewed the literature regarding neurosarcoidosis with dysautonomia.

Comparison of the frequency of autonomic dysfunction among patients with neurosarcoidosis with severe dysautonomia and those with anti-gAChR antibody-positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) revealed that orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms, were the most common presentations in both groups. These results in neurosarcoidosis with severe dysautonomia are similar to those reported previously and support similar autonomic symptoms' characteristics between neurosarcoidosis with autonomic dysfunction and AAG.

Hypergammaglobulinemia was observed in seven of nine patients. It was previously reported in patients with sarcoidosis and has been suggested that hypergammaglobulinemia or circulating immune complexes may be associated with the clinical course of sarcoidosis. A previous study also reported the presence of higher levels of B-cell activating factor and correspondingly, higher numbers of IgG-producing B cells in the lung tissue. The imbalance in the number of B cells and T follicular helper cell subsets is particularly important for antibody production and may be associated with the development of sarcoidosis. Patients with sarcoidosis frequently have higher titers of autoantibodies than healthy individuals. Several autoantibodies, including anti-mitochondrial, anti-nuclear, anti-double stranded DNA, and anti-ciliary antibodies, are noted in such patients.

### Autonomic dysfunction in peripheral nerve disease [^1139PUZq]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Autonomic neuropathies are inherited or acquired neuropathies in which autonomic nerve fibers are selectively or disproportionately affected. Generally, both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers are affected, although there are exceptions. Acquired cases can be autoimmune in nature, induced by diabetes, amyloidosis, drugs, toxins, or they may remain idiopathic. Autoimmune autonomic neuropathy is often subacute and sometimes associated with neoplasms. High titers of antibodies to ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are present in about half of the severe cases.

The molecular basis of inherited autonomic neuropathies is better understood, with recent identification of the loci and genes responsible for hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies types I, III, and IV. The inherited amyloid neuropathies are due to mutations in three proteins: transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, and gelsolin. Non-invasive autonomic testing serves to complement the clinical and electrophysiological characterization of autonomic neuropathies.

### Dry eye syndrome and sicca complex are commonly found in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^116rMFod]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

This project introduced quantitative dry eye testing to the neurology clinic, demonstrating that Schirmer's tests are feasible to incorporate into dysautonomia practice. Patients endorsing dry eye symptoms have been referred to outpatient ophthalmology, where we defer to their expertise regarding tear breakup times, ocular surface staining, and osmolarity testing. The efficacy of dry eye medications and management in the POTS and dysautonomia patient population is currently unexplored and would benefit from additional research. Thus, this study opens a wide range of opportunities for interdisciplinary research into POTS and dysautonomia.

Dry mouth and exocrine gland dysfunction in the POTS clinic is another frontier for autonomic research. Dry mouth symptoms can be explored objectively in patients in the POTS clinic with further testing. Non-invasive options for future investigation include salivary gland scintigraphy, whole sialometry, and salivary gland ultrasound.

Finally, patients surveyed in our study were also asked to endorse whether they had been identified as having any genetic variant. Some of our patients underwent genetic testing for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, as there is significant clinical overlap between patients with hypermobility disorders and POTS. An additional direction for further investigation would be to see if patients with the subset of hypermobility disorders experience a greater association with exocrine gland dysfunction compared to other patients with POTS.

### Differential impact of individual autonomic domains on clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease [^112s4S4w]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, our results showed that among autonomic domains, cardiovascular dysautonomia was associated with a higher risk of developing disability milestones and worse progression of functional impairment and HRQoL over the course of 5 years. Whether cardiovascular dysautonomia directly causes worse outcomes in PD or is only one of the features of a multifaceted malignant phenotype remains a major knowledge gap. To clarify these hypotheses, and to determine the potential role of delaying or even preventing the development of dementia and other disability milestones by treating cardiovascular dysautonomia, additional prospective research in larger multicentric cohorts is needed.

### Multiple system atrophy: An update and emerging directions of biomarkers and clinical trials [^115AwTkh]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia), parkinsonism, and cerebellar syndrome are still the essential clinical characteristics listed in the new criteria. Autonomic dysfunction significantly impacts blood pressure and bladder control. The presence and severity of orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be determined by cardiovascular autonomic function tests that measure supine and standing blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Continuous blood pressure monitoring and head-up tilt (HUT) testing could provide additional information and help differentiate multiple system atrophy (MSA) from similar diseases. Although autonomic tests regarding postvoid residual (PVR) or HUT were performed easily and reported to be useful in the diagnosis of MSA, normal cardiac sympathetic imaging (123 I-MIBG-scintigraphy) could also benefit the diagnosis of MSA and even distinguish Parkinson's disease (PD) from MSA patients. As cardiac sympathetic postganglionic denervation distinguishes PD from MSA patients with intact innervation, the radiolabeled noradrenaline analog 123 I-MIBG may assist in distinguishing MSA from PD. MSA patients exhibit preserved tracer uptake, whereas PD patients exhibit reduced tracer uptake. Furthermore, a supine plasma noradrenaline level greater than 100 pg/ml associated with neurogenic OH might support the diagnosis of MSA.

Taken together, imaging biomarker 123 I-MIBG and plasma biomarker noradrenaline level may support the diagnosis of MSA before the appearance of severe autonomic dysfunction and motor disability. In addition, an elevated PVR volume (greater than 100 ml) is the most specific indicator of bladder impairment in MSA that can be detected by urodynamic testing.

### Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in obesity, the metabolic syndrome and prediabetes: A narrative review [^115MARvY]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

- **Summary of cardiovascular reflex tests and spectral analysis of HRV**: Clinical examination signs suggesting the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) include resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, and a postural blood pressure drop of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or at least 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a useful tool to demonstrate a loss of the normal blood pressure circadian rhythm, prompting formal testing for CAN with cardiovascular reflex tests.

- **Objective evidence of CAN**: This is defined and assessed using standard bedside cardiovascular reflex tests and heart rate variation (HRV). Diagnosis should be based on a battery of tests rather than a single result, as no single test is superior. The cardiovascular reflex tests are considered the gold standard due to their reproducibility, safety, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with peripheral neuropathy.

- **Protocols of cardiovascular reflex testing**: These are based on heart rate responses (measured by the R–R interval on an ECG) and blood pressure to various stimuli. Spectral analysis of HRV uses a 10-minute continuous resting ECG recording at the start of tests to avoid bias. Advanced computer processing produces the power spectrum.

### Pediatric autonomic testing: Retrospective review of a large series [^112FvnHQ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the reasons for referral, autonomic diagnoses, test results, and patient management in a large pediatric population referred for testing for an autonomic disorder. The authors reviewed autonomic testing data and medical records for patients aged 18 years and younger who underwent testing between 1993 and 2007 and who had adequate clinical data. The relevance of test results to clinical symptoms was ranked on a 3-point scale. Treatments were noted, and their benefit was ranked on a 5-point scale.

Results indicate that among 142 pediatric patients identified, postural tachycardia syndrome was most common (71%), while orthostatic hypotension was rare (5%). Testing provided relevant information regarding the patient's symptoms in 88% of the cases. Beta-blockers were the most commonly prescribed medication (59%); 73% of patients showed improvement.

Conclusions highlight that postural tachycardia syndrome was common in this large pediatric population, whereas orthostatic hypotension was infrequent. The symptomatic improvement in the majority bears an unclear relationship to treatment. Prospective studies are needed.

### Heterogeneous pattern of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^113CdjrH]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysautonomic symptoms are frequent non-motor complaints in patients with Parkinson's disease. Numerous neuropathological studies have shown that Lewy bodies and neurites, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, are widely distributed throughout the peripheral autonomic nervous systems and across end organs. However, few investigations integrally explored the symptoms and physiology of dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease. We, therefore, performed a comprehensive evaluation of the autonomic function in a prospective group of 45 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

- **Autonomic components**: Pupillomotor, tear, salivary, cardiovascular, digestive, urinary, sexual, sudomotor functions, and skin sensitivity were evaluated using questionnaires and functional tests. Skin biopsy was performed for intraepidermal nerve fibre density quantification. In addition, all patients underwent polysomnography and a complete neuropsychological and neurological assessment.

- **Analysis and findings**: The analysis of association of autonomic components showed that dysautonomic signs and symptoms were heterogeneously distributed among patients. Skin denervation, as assessed by intraepidermal nerve fibre density quantification, was only associated with quantitative thermal sensory testing (OR = 12.0, p = 0.02), constipation (OR = 5.5, p = 0.01), and ocular dryness symptoms (OR = 8.29, p = 0.04). Cognitive alteration was associated with cardiovascular symptoms (OR = 4.33, p = 0.03) and dysfunction (OR = 5.83, p = 0.02) as well as with constipation (OR = 5.38, p = 0.02).

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic hypotension associated with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes [^111Wm8qk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction plays a significant role in the blood pressure (BP) decrease associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The clinical picture of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes includes reduced extracellular fluid volume and normotension or hypotension. However, no study has explored autonomic nervous system status in patients experiencing hypotensive episodes associated with these diseases.

We tested sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function in four patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes who have chronic hypotension. Each patient underwent a battery of autonomic reflex tests, which included BP and heart rate response to orthostatic challenge, the Valsalva maneuver, the cold-pressor test, the hand-grip test, and deep breathing exercises. Plasma catecholamines were also measured.

BP was monitored during tests using continuous noninvasive finger BP recording. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in one patient who experienced syncope episodes. The Valsalva ratio ranged from 1.21 to 1.61. During the cold-pressor test, systolic and diastolic BP increases ranged from 8 to 31 mm Hg and 6 to 24 mm Hg, respectively. During the hand-grip test, systolic and diastolic BP increases ranged from 10 to 39 mm Hg and 8 to 32 mm Hg, respectively. During hyperventilation, the difference between the highest and lowest heart rates was 12 or more beats per minute in all patients. Patients' plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased during standing.

Our preliminary results suggest that chronic hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes is not associated with sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113bmx3o]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically with respect to screening for diabetic neuropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing for symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy. These include orthostatic dizziness, syncope, resting tachycardia, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities. Assessment should begin at diagnosis and occur at least annually thereafter in patients with evidence of other microvascular complications, particularly kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1132ZTDm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Determination of the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination, including supine and standing BP measurements and an ECG. If determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, then autonomic function testing is warranted.

- **Diagnostic algorithm and treatment options for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension**: BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; DBP, diastolic BP; HR, heart rate; MI, myocardial infarction; nOH, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; OH, orthostatic hypotension; SBP, systolic BP.

The underlying causes of nOH can be varied, and there are multiple factors to be considered in the management of nOH, especially in the face of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient who presented with autonomic nervous system impairment and OH with systemic organ involvement, including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with PD and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia because the symptoms overlapped with those seen in nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before diagnostic testing for nOH was even considered. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms.
