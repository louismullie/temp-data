## Question

What is a diagnostic mammogram

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a diagnostic mammogram is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and how it differs from screening mammography. Then, I should verify the clinical indications that trigger a diagnostic mammogram. Next, I will examine the technical approach and imaging protocols, including special views and tomosynthesis. After that, I need to check the reporting framework and BI-RADS categories, including when to use Category 0. Finally, I should consider workflow, supervision, communication, and how diagnostic mammography fits into the broader diagnostic pathway with ultrasound and biopsy decisions.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental definition. A diagnostic mammogram is an X-ray examination of the breast performed when the patient has signs or symptoms of breast disease or when an abnormality is identified on screening, whereas screening mammography is performed in asymptomatic patients for early detection; this distinction is foundational and consistently defined across authoritative sources.

> Wait, let me verify the indications so I don't overgeneralize. Diagnostic mammography is used to evaluate clinical findings such as a palpable lump, nipple discharge, skin changes, or focal pain, and it is also used to work up abnormal screening results; it may be requested to characterize findings from other modalities like MRI or CT, and it is appropriate for short-interval follow-up of probably benign findings per BI-RADS, which I should explicitly note to avoid confusion with screening workflows [^f610d9b4] [^0eb76f4a] [^d0045232].

> I will now examine the technical approach, because diagnostic mammography is not just a repeat screening. It typically includes standard craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views plus targeted supplemental views such as spot compression, magnification, or tangential views to evaluate the area of concern; digital breast tomosynthesis may be added to improve characterization of masses, asymmetries, and architectural distortion, and the interpreting physician should be immediately available to direct the study and correlate with clinical findings [^f0bdca97] [^0eb76f4a].

> Hold on, I should verify the reporting framework and BI-RADS usage in the diagnostic setting. Reports must state that the examination is diagnostic, document the clinical concern, describe breast density using BI-RADS categories, detail findings with BI-RADS terminology, assign a final assessment category, and provide management recommendations; importantly, Category 0 is not used for diagnostic mammography when further MRI is warranted — instead, a final assessment should be issued for the combined diagnostic workup and MRI recommended if needed, whereas Category 0 is reserved for incomplete evaluations requiring additional imaging or prior studies [^041b46f8] [^9ef9deca] [^2b00e3b0].

> Let me consider workflow and supervision, because these affect quality and timeliness. Diagnostic mammography should be performed under the immediate supervision of the interpreting physician, which can include telemammography with real-time availability; facilities must have processes to convert screening to diagnostic when symptoms are elicited, and they should maintain systems for same-day add-on diagnostic imaging and, when indicated, image-guided biopsy to minimize delays and return visits [^f0bdca97] [^f610d9b4] [^f8aa4a66].

> Next, I should review communication requirements so I don't miss patient-facing obligations. Patients must receive a written lay summary within 30 days, and for BI-RADS 4 or 5 assessments, facilities should attempt direct verbal communication within 5 working days and document it; for self-referred patients, communication should occur within 5 working days and facilities must have referral pathways documented, with the radiologist able to act as the referring physician if willing and appropriate [^32cb7e20] [^d98b7f77] [^691cac25].

> But wait, what if the diagnostic mammogram is negative and symptoms persist? I need to ensure I address next steps. Ultrasound is commonly used as an adjunct to evaluate palpable findings, characterize masses, and guide biopsy, and in selected scenarios MRI may be considered when conventional imaging is negative but clinical suspicion remains high; biopsy decisions should integrate imaging and clinical findings rather than relying on a single modality, and short-interval follow-up is reasonable for probably benign assessments with very low malignancy risk [^a81432b7] [^789fe36a] [^d0045232].

> I should double-check how diagnostic mammography fits into the broader diagnostic pathway so I don't overstate its role. Diagnostic mammography is a key step after abnormal screening or clinical findings, but it does not replace tissue diagnosis when suspicion is high; image-guided core needle biopsy is the standard for suspicious lesions, and diagnostic imaging helps localize, stage, and plan interventions while minimizing unnecessary surgery or delays in care [^c65a049b] [^84de2f00] [^1e7b0834].

> In summary, a diagnostic mammogram is a problem-focused, physician-supervised breast X-ray study performed to evaluate symptoms or abnormal screening results, employing targeted views and often tomosynthesis, with standardized BI-RADS reporting and integrated pathways to ultrasound and biopsy; it is distinct from screening mammography in purpose, technique, and reporting, and its effective use reduces diagnostic delays and improves alignment of imaging with clinical management [^fd0ca021] [^f0bdca97] [^041b46f8].

A diagnostic mammogram is a **targeted breast X-ray** used to evaluate symptoms (e.g. lump, pain, nipple discharge) or abnormal screening results [^bd007a91]. It includes **additional views** (spot compression, magnification, or tomosynthesis) to characterize findings and guide next steps, such as ultrasound or biopsy [^f0bdca97] [^f2d0f098]. Unlike screening mammograms, diagnostic mammograms are performed when there is a clinical concern and are interpreted immediately, with results typically available the same day [^f610d9b4] [^f0bdca97].

---

## Indications for diagnostic mammography

Diagnostic mammography is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Palpable lump**: A new or changing lump detected by the patient or clinician [^a81432b7].
- **Abnormal screening mammogram**: Suspicious findings on a screening mammogram require further evaluation [^f610d9b4].
- **Breast symptoms**: Nipple discharge, skin changes (dimpling, retraction), persistent breast pain, or other clinical concerns [^15ca9287].
- **Short-interval follow-up**: Monitoring probably benign (BI-RADS 3) lesions identified on previous imaging [^f610d9b4] [^d0045232].
- **Post-biopsy or post-surgical evaluation**: Assessing surgical sites, scar tissue, or recurrence [^b98b36b5].

## Differences between screening and diagnostic mammography

| **Feature** | **Screening mammography** | **Diagnostic mammography** |
|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Detect asymptomatic breast cancer in average-risk women | Evaluate symptoms or abnormal findings |
| Patient population | Asymptomatic women | Symptomatic women or those with abnormal screening results |
| Views obtained | Standard two views (CC and MLO) | Additional views (spot compression, magnification, tomosynthesis) |
| Interpretation | Interpreted later; results sent to patient | Interpreted immediately; results discussed with patient |
| Follow-up | Routine recall intervals | Immediate further imaging or biopsy if indicated |

---

## Procedure and techniques

During a diagnostic mammogram, the following steps are typically followed:

- **Clinical history**: The radiologist reviews symptoms, prior imaging, and medical history [^5115960a].
- **Additional imaging**: Spot compression, magnification views, or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) are used to better visualize the area of concern [^f0bdca97].
- **Immediate interpretation**: The radiologist reviews images in real-time, often correlating with clinical findings [^f0bdca97].
- **Further evaluation**: If suspicious findings are identified, ultrasound or image-guided biopsy may be recommended [^f2d0f098].

---

## Role of diagnostic mammography in breast cancer diagnosis

Diagnostic mammography plays a critical role in breast cancer diagnosis by:

- **Characterizing abnormalities**: Differentiating benign from malignant lesions [^f2d0f098].
- **Guiding interventions**: Identifying the exact location and extent of suspicious areas for biopsy or surgical planning [^c65a049b].
- **Reducing unnecessary biopsies**: Helping avoid unnecessary procedures by identifying benign features [^d8fcaed2].
- **Facilitating early detection**: Enabling timely diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer [^6a8d1fd2].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While diagnostic mammography is highly valuable, it has limitations:

- **False negatives**: Some cancers, particularly in dense breasts, may not be visible on mammography [^15ca9287].
- **False positives**: Benign lesions may appear suspicious, leading to additional testing or biopsy [^6a8d1fd2].
- **Radiation exposure**: Minimal but cumulative with repeated exposures [^6a8d1fd2].
- **Patient anxiety**: Waiting for results or undergoing additional testing can cause stress [^6a8d1fd2].

---

## Patient experience and communication

Patients undergoing diagnostic mammography typically experience:

- **Immediate results**: Results are often provided the same day, reducing anxiety and enabling prompt follow-up [^72c52abf].
- **Clear communication**: Radiologists explain findings and recommend next steps, including any need for additional imaging or biopsy [^c4f48e96].
- **Emotional support**: Staff provide reassurance and support throughout the process [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

A diagnostic mammogram is a **targeted breast X-ray** used to evaluate symptoms or abnormal screening results, providing detailed images that guide clinical decisions. It differs from screening mammography in its indications, techniques, and immediacy of results, playing a crucial role in the accurate diagnosis and management of breast disease.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of screening and diagnostic mammography [^bd007a91]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — screening and diagnostic mammography outlines the purpose, benefits, and definitions of mammographic imaging. The goal of mammography is the detection, characterization, and evaluation of findings suggestive of breast cancer and other breast diseases. Annual screening mammography of age-appropriate asymptomatic patients results in the greatest breast cancer mortality reduction, diagnosis at an earlier stage, and more treatment options with less treatment-related morbidity. Mortality from breast cancer is reduced by more than 40% in screened patients compared to unscreened patients, due to benefits of early detection of smaller, lower stage tumors. A screening mammogram is an X-ray examination of the breast of an asymptomatic patient, whereas a diagnostic mammogram is an X-ray examination of the breast of a patient with signs or symptoms of breast disease.

Diagnostic evaluation is performed to confirm the diagnosis and extent of the disease. The evaluation begins with a careful history and physical examination. Major changes have occurred in the diagnostic evaluation of patients. Frequently the diagnosis is suspected because of an abnormal mammogram or ultrasound, and image-guided biopsies have all but replaced open biopsy. For the primary care physician, the best strategy is to refer the patient to a specialist or a multidisciplinary breast center.

Screening and diagnostic mammography

Mammography is the most important imaging procedure for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The general aim is to enable early treatment of breast cancer, to improve survival rates and to reduce the need for aggressive treatment such as mastectomy, also in the current era of modern therapies. It can be performed in a screening setting or a diagnostic setting. In both settings, whenever possible, preference should be given to full-field digital mammography (not phosphor-plate computer radiography) instead of film-screen mammography, taking in consideration a number of relevant advantages for the women who get a mammogram and for the general population, including lower x-ray dose, higher image quality, possibility of post-processing, digital archiving, image transmission and no chemical pollution.

Screening mammography

Screening is performed periodically in order to find small cancers before they are detected through self-palpation or clinical breast examination. Mammography is performed every 1, 2 or 3 years from the age of 40–50 years until around 70–75, depending on national/regional screening programmes. European guidelines suggest the 2-year interval for the general female population from 50 to 70 years of age. Relevant differences in screening programmes across European countries, including ways of reporting, are due to differences in culture, technical circumstances, biopsy options, financial restrictions and breast cancer prevalence. Women with a high frequency of breast cancer in their family should start even earlier with periodic imaging, possibly with protocols including contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after consulting specialised centres, since mammograms in those conditions may have a very limited diagnostic power.

Screening mammography is a standardised procedure composed of four views (also named projections), two for each breast: the cranio-caudal projection and the medio-lateral oblique projection. In some countries, clinical breast examination is a part of the procedure, even though its added value in the screening setting, when mammography is performed, is negligible. Screening mammography can be performed by a radiographer alone; the resulting images are usually read by two radiologists, independently, in separate sessions. If the examination is judged to not reveal any abnormality suspicious for malignancy, the woman receives a letter communicating this result. If something suspicious is found, the woman is recalled for a tailored further assessment that can be variably composed of additional mammographic views, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, MRI, CESM or needle biopsy. When this assessment is concluded, a formal written report will be prepared by the radiologist and given to the woman during a dedicated interview for complete information.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of screening and diagnostic mammography [^5115960a]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

ACR Practice Parameter — request for diagnostic mammography specifies that the written or electronic request for a diagnostic mammography examination evaluation should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination and allow for its proper performance and interpretation. Documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes 1) signs and symptoms and/or 2) relevant history (including known diagnoses), and additional information regarding the specific reason(s) for the examination or a provisional diagnosis would be helpful and may at times be needed to allow for the proper performance and interpretation of the examination. The request for a diagnostic examination must be originated by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider, and the accompanying clinical information should be provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider familiar with the patient's clinical problem or question and consistent with the state.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^d26bc032]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose:

The aim of this study was to develop a prioritization strategy for scheduling immediate screening mammographic interpretation and possible diagnostic evaluation.

Methods:

A population-based cohort with screening mammograms performed from 2012 to 2020 at 126 radiology facilities from 7 Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registries was identified. Classification trees identified combinations of clinical history (age, BI-RADS ® density, time since prior mammogram, history of false-positive recall or biopsy result), screening modality (digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis), and facility characteristics (profit status, location, screening volume, practice type, academic affiliation) that grouped screening mammograms by recall rate, with ≥ 12/100 considered high and ≥ 16/100 very high. An efficiency ratio was estimated as the percentage of recalls divided by the percentage of mammograms.

Results:

The study cohort included 2,674,051 screening mammograms in 925,777 women, with 235,569 recalls. The most important predictor of recall was time since prior mammogram, followed by age, history of false-positive recall, breast density, history of benign biopsy, and screening modality. Recall rates were very high for baseline mammograms (21.3/100; 95% confidence interval, 19.7–23.0) and high for women with ≥ 5 years since prior mammogram (15.1/100; 95% confidence interval, 14.3–16.1). The 9.2% of mammograms in subgroups with very high and high recall rates accounted for 19.2% of recalls, an efficiency ratio of 2.1 compared with a random approach. Adding women < 50 years of age with dense breasts accounted for 20.3% of mammograms and 33.9% of recalls (efficiency ratio = 1.7). Results including facility-level characteristics were similar.

Conclusions:

Prioritizing women with baseline mammograms or ≥ 5 years since prior mammogram for immediate interpretation and possible diagnostic evaluation could considerably reduce the number of women needing to return for diagnostic imaging at another visit.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of invasive breast cancer [^c1a28033]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes should be determined based on evidence-based guidelines. It is important to understand the indications for extent of disease evaluation and staging, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and even result in adverse outcomes. In asymptomatic patients that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrence. Routine surveillance with an annual 2-D mammogram and/or tomosynthesis is recommended to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of breast cancer, and MRI is increasingly used as an additional screening tool in this population, especially in women with dense breasts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Communicating results of diagnostic mammography: what do patients think? [^72c52abf]. Academic Radiology (2000). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate women's preferences for who (radiologist or referring physician) should communicate the results of diagnostic mammography.

Materials and Methods

Data from 153 women presenting to two sites for diagnostic mammography between February and June 1995 were collected with a 24-item, self-administered, closed-ended survey. For both normal and abnormal hypothetical results, contingency tables with chi2 tests and multiple logistic regression were used to determine the association, if any, between women's characteristics and their preferences.

Results

Women undergoing diagnostic mammography preferred that their radiologists disclose their normal (90%) and abnormal (88%) mammogram results to them immediately after their examination, rather than have their referring physicians disclose results at a later time. In the case of normal findings, women whose regular physicians were specialists were less likely to want to hear first from their radiologists (odds ratio [OR] = 0.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01, 0.77; P = 0.03), but women who were nervous about learning their results were more likely to want to hear first from their radiologists (OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 17.3; P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Radiologists may want to consider assessing women's preferences for who communicates their mammogram results, as most women in this study preferred to hear these results from their radiologists rather than waiting to hear from their referring physicians.

### Mammography: an update of the EUSOBI recommendations on information for women [^15ca9287]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic performance of mammography

No diagnostic test is perfect. This rule also applies to mammography. When thinking about screening, women should be aware that about 28% of cancers can be missed, especially in pre-menopausal women and in those with dense breasts. This means that if we consider 1000 women getting a screening mammogram, if 8–10 cancers are present, 2 or 3 can be missed, mostly because they are difficult to distinguish from normal breast tissue. Still, mammography is the best proven method for screening average-risk women.

Note F. Do not underestimate the importance of breast symptoms (especially a new palpable lump, skin/nipple retraction or nipple discharge), regardless of the timing of your last negative mammogram. Go to your radiologist and ask for a visit. Tell her/him your symptoms and she/he will decide the best course of action for you. Conversely, not all suspicious findings visualised on a mammogram are cancers: depending on the level of suspicion, cancer is confirmed in a highly variable proportion of cases. When the suspicion is confirmed after further assessment, image-guided needle biopsy is mandatory before planning any treatment.

Note G. A suspicious mammographic finding is not a confirmed cancer. However, do not postpone further assessment and, if necessary, needle biopsy.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^1c91e77d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to develop a prioritization strategy for scheduling immediate screening mammographic interpretation and possible diagnostic evaluation.

Methods

A population-based cohort with screening mammograms performed from 2012 to 2020 at 126 radiology facilities from 7 Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registries was identified.

An efficiency ratio was estimated as the percentage of recalls divided by the percentage of mammograms.

Results

The study cohort included 2,674,051 screening mammograms in 925,777 women, with 235,569 recalls. The most important predictor of recall was time since prior mammogram, followed by age, history of false-positive recall, breast density, history of benign biopsy, and screening modality. Recall rates were very high for baseline mammograms (21.3/100; 95% confidence interval, 19.7–23.0) and high for women with ≥ 5 years since prior mammogram (15.1/100; 95% confidence interval, 14.3–16.1).

### Performance goals for an adjunct diagnostic Test to reduce unnecessary biopsies After screening mammography: analysis of costs, benefits, and consequences [^bd289663]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because benign biopsies resulting from false-positive mammographic findings are a known harm of breast cancer screening, physicians and test manufacturers are searching for ways to reduce their frequency. The aim of this study was to estimate potential costs and consequences associated with using an adjunct diagnostic test for triaging women with suspicious mammographic findings before biopsy.

Methods

A decision model was developed to compare the use of an adjunct test before biopsy to the current standard of care for suspicious mammographic findings. The decision analysis was performed from the perspective of a national health payer, with a 1-year time horizon among women representative of the US screening population aged 40 to 79 years. Three primary outcomes were assessed: (1) incremental costs, (2) number of benign biopsies avoided, and (3) number of missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened. Input parameters were obtained from the medical literature and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of uncertainty in parameter estimates.

Results

The base-case analysis demonstrated that the use of an adjunct diagnostic test with 95% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a cost of $1,000 would eliminate 8,127 unnecessary breast biopsies per million women screened. However, this would cost the US health care system an additional $6,462,977 and result in 255 missed opportunities for diagnosing cancer per million women screened.

Conclusions

The addition of an adjunct test for triaging women for breast biopsy after abnormal findings on screening mammography would likely eliminate many unnecessary biopsies but also increase overall health care costs. This exploratory analysis highlights the fact that mammography remains a relatively inexpensive and effective breast cancer screening and diagnostic modality.

### Breast cancer screening and diagnosis: a synopsis of the European breast guidelines [^12a36b1d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The European Commission Initiative for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis guidelines (European Breast Guidelines) are coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The target audience for the guidelines includes women, health professionals, and policymakers.

Methods

An international guideline panel of 28 multidisciplinary members, including patients, developed questions and corresponding recommendations that were informed by systematic reviews of the evidence conducted between March 2016 and December 2018. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to structure the process and minimize the influence of competing interests by enhancing transparency. Questions and recommendations, expressed as strong or conditional, focused on outcomes that matter to women and provided a rating of the certainty of evidence.

Recommendations

This synopsis of the European Breast Guidelines provides recommendations regarding organized screening programs for women aged 40 to 75 years who are at average risk. The recommendations address digital mammography screening and the addition of hand-held ultrasonography, automated breast ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging compared with mammography alone. The recommendations also discuss the frequency of screening and inform decision making for women at average risk who are recalled for suspicious lesions or who have high breast density.

### Current breast imaging modalities, advances, and impact on breast care [^a9e9aa9c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Mammography will continue as the breast cancer screening imaging study of choice for the foreseeable future. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely available adjunctive studies for women with suspicious mammographic or clinical findings, and MRI is a screening tool for women with specific increased risks for breast cancer. Options for diagnosis will continue to evolve and progress. This article discusses a wide variety of imaging options currently used and in development, their strengths, limitations, and potential future roles in the continuing pursuit of early breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^8484d950]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Breast cancer screening (PDQ ®)-health professional version… [^05386daa]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Mammography is the most widely used screening modality for the detection of breast cancer. There is evidence that it decreases breast cancer mortality in women aged 50 to 69 years and that it is associated with harms, including the detection of clinically insignificant cancers that pose no threat to life. The benefit of mammography for women aged 40 to 49 years is uncertain. The Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2, which evaluated women aged 50 to 59 years, found a fourfold increase in DCIS cases in women screened by clinical breast examination plus mammography, compared with those screened by CBE alone, with no difference in breast cancer mortality. generally increasing sensitivity, decreasing specificity, and increasing detection of ductal carcinoma.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on nonpalpable mammographic findings (excluding calcifications) [^dffee1b8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Screening mammography can detect breast cancer before it becomes clinically apparent. However, the screening process identifies many false-positive findings for each cancer eventually confirmed. Additional tools are available to help differentiate spurious findings from real ones and to help determine when tissue sampling is required, when short-term follow-up will suffice, or whether the finding can be dismissed as benign. These tools include additional diagnostic mammographic views, breast ultrasound, breast MRI, and, when histologic evaluation is required, percutaneous biopsy. The imaging evaluation of a finding detected at screening mammography proceeds most efficiently, cost-effectively, and with minimization of radiation dose when approached in an evidence-based manner. The appropriateness of the above-referenced tools is presented here as they apply to a variety of findings often encountered on screening mammography; an algorithmic approach to workup of these potential scenarios is also included. The recommendations put forth represent a compilation of evidence-based data and expert opinion of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) Expert Panel on Breast Imaging.

### Radiologists' interpretive skills in screening vs. diagnostic mammography: are they related? [^b540e365]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to determine whether radiologists who perform well in screening also perform well in interpreting diagnostic mammography.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated the accuracy of 468 radiologists interpreting 2,234,947 screening and 196,164 diagnostic mammograms. Adjusting for site, radiologist, and patient characteristics, we identified radiologists with performance in the highest tertile and compared to those with lower performance.

Results

A moderate correlation was noted for radiologists' accuracy when interpreting screening versus their accuracy on diagnostic examinations: sensitivity (r spearman = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.80; P = 0.0006) and specificity (r spearman = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.49; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Different educational approaches to screening and diagnostic imaging should be considered.

### Breast cancer screening modalities, recommendations, and novel imaging techniques [^8c83314b]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Among women, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mammography remains the only validated screening tool to reduce breast cancer mortality. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that average-risk women undergo breast cancer screening every year starting at age 40. This article reviews the fundamentals of mammography screening, current age-based mammography screening recommendations, supplemental breast cancer screening recommendations in high-risk women, and novel imaging technologies. This review summarizes recommendations from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and published guidelines from major societies to reflect a range of evidence-based perspectives regarding mammographic screening.

### Evaluation of abnormal mammography results and palpable breast abnormalities [^f2d0f098]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Because approximately 1 in 10 women with a breast lump or abnormal mammography result will have breast cancer, a series of decisions must be taken by a primary care practitioner to exclude or establish a diagnosis of breast cancer among these women.

Purpose

To determine the most accurate and least invasive means to evaluate an abnormal mammography result and a palpable breast abnormality.

Data Source

MEDLINE search (January 1966 to March 2003) for articles and reviews describing the accuracy of clinical examination, biopsy procedures, and radiographic examination for patients with abnormal mammography results or palpable breast abnormalities.

Study Selection

The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that provided relevant primary data. Studies were included if 1) mammography, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or core-needle biopsy was performed before a definitive diagnosis was obtained; 2) the study sample included 100 or more women; and 3) breast cancer status was determined from histopathology review of excisional biopsy specimens, from linkage with a state cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, or from clinical follow-up of 95% or more of the study sample.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted results. Methods were evaluated for major potential biases, but methodologic scoring was not performed.

Data Synthesis

Likelihood ratios for first screening mammography were 0.1 for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category "negative or benign finding", 1.2 for "probably benign finding", 7 for "need additional imaging evaluation", 125 for "suspicious abnormality", and 2200 for "highly suggestive of malignancy". For fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a palpable lump performed by formally trained physicians, the likelihood ratio was infinity for an assessment of "malignant", 2.6 for "atypical/suspicious", and 0.02 for "benign". When diagnostic mammography was used to evaluate a palpable lump or nonpalpable breast abnormality, the positive likelihood ratios were 5.6 and 9.4, and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.15 and 0.19, respectively.

Conclusions

Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as "suspicious abnormality" or "highly suggestive of malignancy" have a high risk for breast cancer and should undergo core-needle biopsy or needle localization with surgical biopsy. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as "need additional imaging evaluation" have a moderate risk for breast cancer and should undergo diagnostic mammography or ultrasonography to decide whether a nonpalpable breast lesion should be biopsied. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as "probably benign finding" have a low risk for breast cancer and can undergo follow-up mammography in 6 months. Either fine-needle aspiration biopsy or ultrasonography is recommended as the first diagnostic test of a palpable breast abnormality to distinguish simple cysts from solid masses. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy also allows characterization of a solid mass. Diagnostic mammography does not help determine whether a palpable breast mass should be biopsied and should not affect the decision to perform a biopsy.

### In the setting of negative mammogram, is additional breast ultrasound necessary for evaluation of breast pain? [^1d319c03]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether in the setting of negative diagnostic mammogram for breast pain additional ultrasound is necessary.

Methods

Retrospective IRB-approved review of our database identified 8085 women who underwent ultrasound evaluation for breast pain from 1/1/2013–12/31/2013. Of 8085 women, 559 women had mammogram evaluation preceding the ultrasound and these women comprise the basis of this study. The patient's age, type of mammogram examination (screening or diagnostic), Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density (BD), type of breast pain (focal, diffuse, cyclical, unilateral, bilateral), additional breast symptoms (palpable concern, nipple discharge, skin changes, others), mammogram or ultrasound findings and final BI-RADS assessment, follow-up imaging, and follow-up biopsy results were reviewed and recorded.

Results

The median age of patients was 46 years old (range: 27–97). Patients recalled from negative screening mammogram were 29.8% (167/559). Patients with preceding negative diagnostic mammogram were 70.2% (392/559). The BI-RADS BD distribution was BD1: 5.5%, BD2: 39.9%, BD3: 46.0%, BD4: 8.6%. Final BI-RADS assessments were BI-RADS 1/2 (79%), BI-RADS 3 (12.9%), BI-RADS 4 (8.1%), BI-RADS 5 (0%). Majority (66.9%, 374/559) of the patient had breast pain alone. Additional breast symptoms were also noted as follows: palpable concern (24%), nipple discharge (3.9%), skin changes or other (5.2%). On follow-up evaluation, 26 findings were recommended for tissue sampling yielding 2 malignancies (0.4%, 2/559) in 2 patients. In the setting of negative mammogram and clinical symptom of breast pain alone yielded no malignances (NPV, 100%, 374/374) and was not impacted by BD. In patients with additional symptoms accompanying pain, malignancies were present despite negative mammogram in 2 patients; nipple discharge (4.5%, 1/22), and palpable concern (0.7%, 1/134).

Conclusion

In the setting of negative mammogram and breast pain alone, additional evaluation with ultrasound is likely low yield and may be unnecessary. However, with additional symptoms such as palpable concern or nipple discharge, ultrasound is likely an important adjunct modality for identifying mammographically occult tumors.

### Mammography: an update of the EUSOBI recommendations on information for women [^1b77fd06]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Mammography report and classification systems

Diagnostic mammography and also diagnostic assessment of recalled women after mammography screening should be formally carried out by a certified breast radiologist. A detailed report should include a description of the clinical context, if relevant, as well as image findings, including breast density and structure according to different classification systems, interpretation of the described findings and a final conclusion with recommendations. In many European countries, standardised classification systems for the conclusions of mammography reports are used. A European system uses the five-level scale from R1 to R5, where R stands for radiography. R1 means no abnormalities, R2 benign findings, R3 equivocal findings, R4 suspected cancer and R5 strongly suspected cancer. A system developed in the USA, the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), also used in many European countries, includes a similar scale, from BI-RADS 1 to BI-RADS 5. The main difference is for BI-RADS 3, which implies a very low probability of cancer (less than 2%), allowing the possibility of waiting for a short interval (usually 3–6 months) before a repeat mammogram. Conversely, the R3 category indicates a probability of cancer that is higher than that of BI-RADS 3. Moreover, the BI-RADS score system also includes BIRADS 0 (examination insufficient for a diagnostic conclusion; further work-up needed) and BI-RADS 6 (evaluation of an already diagnosed cancer).

Note E. In practice, if you have an R4–R5 or a BI-RADS 4–5 finding, needle biopsy is recommended. In case of R3 or BI-RADS 3, meet your radiologist and ask for a detailed explanation of this result, of the risks and probabilities associated with different options.

### A survey by the European society of breast imaging on radiologists' preferences regarding quality assurance measures of image interpretation in screening and diagnostic mammography [^ba0504f9]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

To address these differences while continuing to increase the standards of care, EUSOMA has developed a voluntary certification scheme for diagnostic and screening units, signifying that the quality standards have been achieved. According to this scheme, breast radiologists are required to interpret a minimum of 1000 mammography cases annually whereas those who participate in an organised population-based screening programme must have a workload of at least 5000 cases per year.

Compared to the European guidelines, the USA image readers are required to interpret a smaller number of cases. According to the American College of Radiology, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) requires all personnel involved in reporting mammograms to examine at least 960 cases over a 24-month period.

More than half of the responders stated that they have established quality assurance measures in their workplace in order to work within a specialist framework. Although such measures are partially mandatory for private practice, the majority of responders working in a private sector are also required to follow QA practices. To comply with performance indicators and targets, all breast radiologists need to take part in internal and external audit procedures with corrective action being undertaken as required to achieve optimum performance and interpretation of breast images. Benchmarking provides the quantitative evidence to assess and monitor their radiological performance, determine potential problems and understand areas for improvement. Recording and analysing individuals' actual data is important although data often needs to be accumulated over several years to give robust cancer detection figures.

Performance feedback to radiologists is a quality assurance measure that facilitates awareness of their key performance indicators (such as recall rate, cancer detection, interval cancer rate and false-positive recall) but also highlights their need for further training. Tailored to specific needs training activities and participation in continuing medical education improve readers' image interpretation skills, reading performance and confidence in decision making — particularly to those who are less experienced. It is evident that new or less experienced readers who regularly participate in assessment tests and receive feedback in their reading performance rapidly improve their cancer detection skills.

In order to maintain radiological performance and improve outcomes, it is also vital for readers to participate in regular MDT meetings with expert specialists from different disciplines. Attending such meetings is beneficial for feedback and educational purposes, as readers can discuss cases both pre- and post-operatively with other professional colleagues, access patients' cytological and pathological results and better conform to evidence-based guidelines that outline the standards for readers and describe methods to best achieve them. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of MDT participation to improve radiologists' screening performance and patient outcomes.

### Advances in breast imaging with current screening recommendations and controversies [^53a86195]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last several decades, breast imaging has undergone transformation. Technological advances in mammography and ultrasound and the development and increased availability of imaging modalities used in supplemental screening and diagnostic settings, including tomosynthesis and breast MRI, have allowed for improved breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Image-guided core breast biopsies have largely replaced fine needle aspirations. This article discusses the current status of breast imaging in the screening and diagnostic settings and is intended to inform the referring physician of why and how common studies and procedures are performed in the breast imaging clinic.

### Overdiagnosis and risks of breast cancer screening [^6a8d1fd2]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Since its widespread introduction 30 years ago, screening mammography has contributed to substantial reduction in breast cancer-associated mortality, ranging from 15% to 50% in observational trials. It is currently the best examination available for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, when survival and treatment options are most favorable. However, like all medical tests and procedures, screening mammography has associated risks, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment, false-positive examinations, false-positive biopsies, and radiation exposure. Women should be aware of the benefits and risks of screening mammography in order to make the most appropriate care decisions for themselves.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of screening and diagnostic mammography [^9ef9deca]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment use in diagnostic versus screening mammography — For diagnostic breast imaging when further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is warranted, BI-RADS category 0 should not be used; the radiologist should issue a final assessment for the combined diagnostic mammography and ultrasound (US) examinations before MRI and, if MRI is warranted, incorporate this recommendation into the combined mammography/US patient management recommendations, with the combined diagnostic breast imaging report standing as issued if the recommended MRI is not performed. For screening mammograms, a BI-RADS Category 3, 4, or 5 assessment is strongly discouraged; instead, patients with screening abnormalities should be given a BI-RADS category 0 assessment and recalled for further diagnostic studies.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of screening and diagnostic mammography [^45443d78]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

Cisgender females — special circumstances for screening mammography include prior treatment, lactation, older age, and ordering status. Asymptomatic patients previously treated for breast cancer may undergo annual screening or annual diagnostic mammography, as determined by the imaging facility. Lactating patients may undergo screening mammography; breast feeding and/or pumping immediately prior to the examination may help minimize any effect of lactation on mammographic density. Screening should continue without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy or ability to accept treatment; one in five breast cancers occurs in patients 75 years or older; screening mammography has increasingly favorable metrics among patients age 74–90 years; screening in patients age 75 or over reduces treatment-related morbidity; and quality-adjusted life-years remain positive for screening up to age 90. A patient may present for a screening mammogram without an advance order from a physician or health care provider, including as a self-referred patient or a self-requesting patient who provides the name of their physician or health care provider.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^f8aa4a66]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although immediate interpretation of screening mammograms alleviates the need for a woman to return on a different day for diagnostic imaging, it also introduces challenges for implementation. Revising a facility's clinical template to support immediate interpretation of screening mammograms likely involves increasing the length of screening mammography appointments to include additional time for imaging interpretation and results communication. Without extending clinic hours and staffing, increasing screening appointment lengths may reduce a clinic's screening mammography capacity. For facilities only offering screening mammography without an on-site radiologist, radiology IT and workflow updates may be needed to enable off-site immediate interpretation and partnership with another facility with same-day access for diagnostic workup. For facilities offering screening and diagnostic imaging services, additional clinical template revisions may be needed to support same day add-on diagnostic mammography and ultrasound appointments. Accommodating same day add-on image-guided biopsies would warrant further revisions to a clinic's interventional appointment template. Although these clinical template revisions support timely resolution of screening episodes, holding these appointments for same-day use may result in decreased overall clinic volume if the same-day appointments are not fully used.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS (FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2)

Diagnostic work-up of an abnormality in the breast

Clinical examination

Figure 1
Diagnosis–clinically detectable breast abnormality.

Figure 2
diagnosis–impalpable mammographic abnormality.

In patients with locally and regionally advanced disease, clinical examination is likely to be of greater diagnostic value than in patients with less advanced disease (standard). Tumours with the following characteristics are unlikely to be operable, and are associated with a poor short-term prognosis: inflammatory change, deep extension, lymphadenopathy, breast oedema and/or lymphoedema in the upper limbs. These factors also indicate an increased risk of locoregional and metastatic recurrence (standard). Thus, nonoperability is not always due to difficulties associated with the surgery itself. Surgery may still be appropriate, however, to achieve local control, despite a poor prognosis. Imaging can be used to confirm findings from clinical examination. In some cases, clinical examination will be normal, so that the diagnosis will only be possible following imaging (standard).

Diagnostic imaging

A standard bilateral mammogram with two views (front and external oblique), can be complemented by other views and by ultrasonography (standard). The equipment used for mammography should undergo regular quality control (standard). To confirm the diagnosis, additional views and enlargements may be necessary (option).

Specific imaging is not indicated in the examination of lymphadenopathy. Standard reporting of mammograms should be used in which the stated diagnosis is based on the mammographic features suspicious of malignancy using the American College of Radiology classification (recommendation).

The diagnostic findings should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. When the level of suspicion from imaging justifies histological verification, this should be done using interventional breast diagnostic techniques in an outpatient setting under a local anaesthetic.

Pretreatment diagnosis

The diagnosis of malignancy can be obtained from cytology (fine-needle aspiration) or tissue sample (core biopsy), whereas the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma can only be made from a biopsy sample (standard).

The histological diagnosis of impalpable lesions should be compared with the diagnostic hypotheses generated from diagnostic imaging (recommendation). The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical hyperplasia from a needle biopsy sample should always be reconfirmed using a sample obtained by surgical excision (recommendation, level of evidence: B1). Regular assessment of the diagnostic performance of image-guided biopsy systems is recommended (recommendation, expert agreement).

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of screening and diagnostic mammography [^f0bdca97]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

ACR Practice Parameter — diagnostic mammography technique and supervision states that a diagnostic mammogram may include full-field CC, MLO, and/or supplemental views to evaluate an area of clinical or imaging concern. Supplemental mammographic views may include spot compression, spot compression with magnification, or other special views, and when determining which views to perform, the distance from the area of concern to the digital detector (or image receptor) should be minimized if possible. DBT may be performed, and lesion characterization may be improved with DBT, especially for noncalcified lesions, spiculated masses, and asymmetries. Diagnostic mammography should be performed under the immediate supervision of the interpreting physician, with immediate supervision defined as the physician being present and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure; immediate supervision may also be accomplished via telemammography as long as the interpreting physician is immediately available.

### ACR appropriateness criteria breast cancer screening [^e67a86ac]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Mammography is the recommended method for breast cancer screening of women in the general population. However, mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women. Therefore, supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound is recommended in selected high-risk populations. Screening breast MRI is recommended in women at high risk for breast cancer on the basis of family history or genetic predisposition. Ultrasound is an option for those high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI. Recent literature also supports the use of breast MRI in some women of intermediate risk, and ultrasound may be an option for intermediate-risk women with dense breasts. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other imaging modalities, such as thermography, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emission mammography, and optical imaging, for breast cancer screening. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review includes an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering screening clinical breast examination in asymptomatic, average-risk females in the context of an informed, shared decision-making approach recognizing the uncertainty of additional benefits and the possibility of adverse consequences of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography. Consider using intervals of every 1–3 years in females aged 25–39 years and annually in females aged ≥ 40 years if it is performed. Perform clinical breast examination as part of evaluation in high-risk females and females with symptoms.

### A bimodal nomogram: a non-invasive tool to assist breast radiologists in decision-making [^d8fcaed2]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, various imaging methods have been successfully incorporated into clinical practice for the study of breast cancer. However, mammography (MG) and ultrasound (US) continue to be by far the most widely used breast imaging methods.

MG is the accepted test for breast cancer screening, and every day a large number of mammograms are performed worldwide, with the aim of diagnosing a smaller breast cancer, improving the prognosis and therapeutic possibilities for this disease. Nonetheless, we know that mammography has limitations, the most important being low sensitivity, especially in women with dense breasts. US is commonly used to supplement MG and improve the detection of mammographically occult cancers.

The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) offers a standardized method to describe MG and US findings, assigns a category based on the probability for malignancy, and offers precise management recommendation. It is not uncommon to find discrepancies between the resulting categories on MG and US. In these cases, the management option will depend on the highest category. If the result of one or both methods is a BI-RADS category 4 or 5, the recommendation will be to perform a biopsy. Thus, although the combined use of MG and US improves cancer detection, it presents low specificity and a high number of benign biopsies. Approximately 57–71% of biopsies of lesions with discordant assessments are unnecessary, which increases healthcare costs and patient distress. It would be desirable to have the information provided by MG and US, maximizing cancer detection and minimizing the number of benign biopsies.

### An assessment of the likelihood, frequency, and content of verbal communication between radiologists and women receiving screening and diagnostic mammography [^c4f48e96]. Academic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Research on communication between radiologists and women undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography is limited. We describe community radiologists' communication practices with patients regarding screening and diagnostic mammogram results and factors associated with frequency of communication.

Materials and Methods

We received surveys from 257 radiologists (70% of those eligible) about the extent to which they talk to women as part of their health care visit for either screening or diagnostic mammograms, whether this occurs if the exam assessment is positive or negative, and how they use estimates of patient risk to convey information about an abnormal exam where the specific finding of cancer is not yet known. We also assessed characteristics of the radiologists to identify associations with more or less frequent communication at the time of the mammogram.

Results

Two hundred and forty-three radiologists provided complete data (95%). Very few (< 6%) reported routinely communicating with women when screening mammograms were either normal or abnormal. Fewer than half (47%) routinely communicated with women when their diagnostic mammograms were normal, whereas 77% often or always communicated with women when their diagnostic exams were abnormal. For positive diagnostic exams, female radiologists were more likely to be frequent communicators compared to males (87.1%-72.8%; P = 0.02) and those who spend 40%-79% of their time in breast imaging (94.6%) were more likely to be frequent communicators compared to those who spend less time (67.2%-78.9%; P = 0.02). Most radiologists convey risk information using general rather than numeric statements (57.7% vs. 28.5%).

Conclusions

Radiologists are most likely to convey information about diagnostic mammographic findings when results are abnormal. Most radiologists convey risk information using general rather than numeric statements.

### BI-RADS 3 on screening breast ultrasound: what is It and what is the appropriate management? [^9df4a2a9]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

US is widely used in breast imaging for diagnostic purposes and is also used increasingly for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. US frequently depicts masses that are occult on mammography, even after tomosynthesis, and the vast majority of such masses are benign. Many masses seen only on screening US are easily recognized as benign simple cysts. Probably benign, BI-RADS 3, or low suspicion, BI-RADS 4A masses are also common and often prompt short-interval follow-up or biopsy, respectively, yet the vast majority of these are benign. This review details appropriate characterization, classification, and new approaches to the management of probably benign masses seen on screening US that can reduce false positives and, thereby, reduce costs and patient anxiety.

### Positive predictive value of mammography: comparison of interpretations of screening and diagnostic images by the same radiologist and by different radiologists [^0bea1860]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the positive predictive value (PPV) after a recommendation for biopsy differs when one as opposed to more than one radiologist performs the workup after abnormal findings are discovered at screening mammography.

Materials and Methods

Using data in a mammography registry for the years 1996–2005, we identified 6,391 diagnostic examinations with a recommendation for biopsy that were performed on a day other than the day of the screening examination. The PPV after a recommendation for biopsy was calculated for two scenarios. In the first scenario, the radiologist interpreting the diagnostic images had interpreted the screening images. In the second scenario, the radiologist read diagnostic images after another radiologist had read the screening images. We used conditional logistic regression analysis to perform within-radiologist comparisons, controlling for covariates known to be associated with PPV after a recommendation for biopsy.

Results

Of the screening examinations with positive findings, 2,335 (36.5%) were scenario 1, and 4,056 (63.5%) were scenario 2. We found no difference between the two scenarios with respect to PPV after a recommendation for biopsy when we controlled for age, breast density, family history of breast cancer, history of breast procedures, time since last mammogram, use of ultrasound at any point in the workup after abnormal results of screening mammography, and interval in days between the screening and diagnostic studies.

Conclusion

Who interprets the follow-up images after screening mammograms show abnormal findings does not appear to be an important factor influencing the wide variability in PPV among radiologists.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® male breast cancer screening [^9ce7173d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer screening recommendations have been established historically for women, but, have been less clearly outlined for men. For average-risk men and younger men less than 25 year of age, imaging is not usually appropriate as a screening test for breast cancer. For men of higher-than-average risk, screening with mammography as annual surveillance imaging is usually appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Mammography remains the primary modality for breast cancer diagnosis. Other imaging studies, most commonly ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, are also used to characterize breast lesions, stage breast cancer, and aid in surgical planning. Although mammography is the only screening examination demonstrated to decrease breast cancer mortality in the general population, other imaging studies have been shown to be beneficial for screening high-risk patients. In the future, new technologies may also improve the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening and detection.

### Patient and radiologist characteristics associated with accuracy of two types of diagnostic mammograms [^d35c0322]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Earlier studies of diagnostic mammography found wide unexplained variability in accuracy among radiologists. We assessed patient and radiologist characteristics associated with the interpretive performance of two types of diagnostic mammography.

Materials and Methods

Radiologists interpreting mammograms in seven regions of the United States were invited to participate in a survey that collected information on their demographics, practice setting, breast imaging experience, and self-reported interpretive volume. Survey data from 244 radiologists were linked to data on 274,401 diagnostic mammograms performed for additional evaluation of a recent abnormal screening mammogram or to evaluate a breast problem, between 1998 and 2008. These data were also linked to patients' risk factors and follow-up data on breast cancer. We measured interpretive performance by false-positive rate, sensitivity, and AUC. Using logistic regression, we evaluated patient and radiologist characteristics associated with false-positive rate and sensitivity for each diagnostic mammogram type.

Results

Mammograms performed for additional evaluation of a recent mammogram had an overall false-positive rate of 11.9%, sensitivity of 90.2%, and AUC of 0.894; examinations done to evaluate a breast problem had an overall false-positive rate of 7.6%, sensitivity of 83.9%, and AUC of 0.871. Multiple patient characteristics were associated with measures of interpretive performance, and radiologist academic affiliation was associated with higher sensitivity for both indications for diagnostic mammograms.

Conclusion

These results indicate the potential for improved radiologist training, using evaluation of their own performance relative to best practices, and for improved clinical outcomes with health care system changes to maximize access to diagnostic mammography interpretation in academic settings.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPalpable breast Masses [^a78c3114]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and the second leading cause of female cancer death in the United States. Although the majority of palpable breast lumps are benign, a new palpable breast mass is a common presenting sign of breast cancer. Any woman presenting with a palpable lesion should have a thorough clinical breast examination, but because many breast masses may not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is necessary in almost all cases to characterize the palpable lesion. Recommended imaging options in the context of a palpable mass include diagnostic mammography and targeted-breast ultrasound and are dependent on patient age and degree of radiologic suspicion as detailed in the document Variants. There is little role for advanced technologies such as MRI, positron emission mammography, or molecular breast imaging in the evaluation of a palpable mass. When a suspicious finding is identified, biopsy is indicated. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging in breast cancer screening: impact of an immediate-read screening mammography program implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic [^dbdcc142]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND. The need for second visits between screening mammography and diagnostic imaging contributes to disparities in the time to breast cancer diagnosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an immediate-read screening mammography program was implemented to reduce patient visits and decrease time to diagnostic imaging. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of an immediate-read screening program with focus on disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal findings are made at screening mammography. METHODS. In May 2020, an immediate-read screening program was implemented whereby a dedicated breast imaging radiologist interpreted all screening mammograms in real time; patients received results before discharge; and efforts were made to perform any recommended diagnostic imaging during the visit (performed by different radiologists). Screening mammographic examinations performed from June 1, 2019, through October 31, 2019 (preimplementation period), and from June 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (postimplementation period), were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics were recorded from the electronic medical record. Multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient age, race and ethnicity, language, and insurance type were estimated to identify factors associated with same-day diagnostic imaging. Screening metrics were compared between periods. RESULTS. A total of 8222 preimplementation and 7235 postimplementation screening examinations were included; 521 patients had abnormal screening findings before implementation, and 359 after implementation. Before implementation, 14.8% of patients underwent same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. This percentage increased to 60.7% after implementation. Before implementation, patients who identified their race as other than White had significantly lower odds than patients who identified their race as White of undergoing same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal screening results (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10–0.86; p = .03). After implementation, the odds of same-day diagnostic imaging were not significantly different between patients of other races and White patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.50–1.71; p = .80). After implementation, there was no significant difference in race and ethnicity between patients who underwent and those who did not undergo same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal results of screening mammography (p > .05). The rate of abnormal interpretation was significantly lower after than it was before implementation (5.0% vs 6.3%; p < .001). Cancer detection rate and PPV1 (PPV based on positive findings at screening examination) were not significantly different before and after implementation (p > .05). CONCLUSION. Implementation of the immediate-read screening mammography program reduced prior racial and ethnic disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. CLINICAL IMPACT. An immediate-read screening program provides a new paradigm for improved screening mammography workflow that allows more rapid diagnostic workup with reduced disparities in care.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^3b97c194]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — implementation details — Screen women aged 40 to 74 years with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or "3D mammography") are effective mammographic screening modalities. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram.

### Screening for breast cancer [^1dd203b6]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The goal of screening is to detect breast cancers when still curable to decrease breast cancer-specific mortality. Breast cancer screening in the United States is routinely performed with mammography, supplemental digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and/or MR imaging. This article aims to review the most commonly used breast imaging modalities for screening, discuss how often and when to begin screening with specific imaging modalities, and examine the pros and cons of screening. By the article's end, the reader will be better equipped to have informed discussions with patients and medical professionals regarding the benefits and disadvantages of breast cancer screening.

Breast cancer screening overdiagnosis and program aims: The panel characterizes overdiagnosis as contested but affirms its existence while acknowledging uncertainty in magnitude, stating that "The issue of overdiagnosis is controversial", and that "The evidence review judged the evidence for the existence of overdiagnosis as high, but evidence for estimating the magnitude of overdiagnosis as low". Programmatically, "The main goal of mammography screening programs is to reduce breast cancer mortality by reducing the incidence rate of advanced breast cancer", recognizing that "A screening test that is successful in detecting small invasive cancers also will detect some precursors", and that "this likely does result in some overdiagnosis, but in other instances, it advances the time of diagnosis of a progressive lesion".

### Cancer screening test receipt-United States, 2018 [^4f14931a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings reported reflect receipt of tests within recommended screening intervals. They do not reflect test overuse, screening quality, or adequacy of follow-up. For example, positive results on CRC screening stool tests need follow-up colonoscopy to complete evaluation, and problems in CRC screening quality exist.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data are self-reported and potentially subject to social desirability and recall bias. Second, survey questions about tests have changed over time. Third, the 2018 sample adult response rate was 53%, and nonresponse bias might exist despite survey weight adjustments; response rates for earlier years have been published. Fourth, because of limited sample sizes, estimates could not be generated for all groups. Finally, percentages might include tests performed for diagnostic purposes. NHIS data from 2018 include self-reported reasons for mammograms but not for cervical cancer tests or the CRC screening measure. Among women who received a mammogram within 2 years in the current analysis, 95% reported that it was part of a "routine exam". A study of CRC tests also suggested that a majority of respondents reported that tests were performed for screening. Consistent with HP2020 measures †† and previous reports, the current analysis included all tests because those receiving diagnostic tests might be considered screened in effect and therefore up to date with screening recommendations.

Continued monitoring can help assess whether national screening targets are achieved, and inform efforts that promote screening test receipt as recommended and reduce barriers for underserved populations to eliminate disparities. To promote screening for these three cancers, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends evidence-based interventions that increase client demand for, access to, and provider delivery of screening services. §§ The Task Force noted that evidence-based interventions can be selected and adapted to meet the needs of communities and specific populations and can be combined to address multiple barriers, potentially at multiple levels. Resources are available to help identify, implement, and evaluate evidence-based approaches through The Community Guide, Evidence-Based Cancer Control Programs and Cancer Control P.L. A.N.E.T. (Plan, Link, Act, Network with Evidence-based Tools). *

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable breast masses: 2022 update [^a81432b7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk [^d016a523]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease diagnosed in women worldwide. Screening with mammography has the ability to detect breast cancer at an early stage. The diagnostic accuracy of mammography screening largely depends on the radiographic density of the imaged breasts. In radiographically dense breasts, non-calcified breast cancers are more likely to be missed than in fatty breasts. As a consequence, some cancers are not detected by mammography screening. Supporters of adjunct ultrasonography to the screening regimen for breast cancer argue that it might be a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce the false negative rates of the screening process. Critics, however, are concerned that performing supplemental ultrasonography on women at average risk will also increase the rate of false positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via OvidSP) and EMBASE up until February 2012. To detect ongoing or unpublished studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and the National Cancer Institute's clinical trial database until June 2012. In addition, we conducted grey literature searches using the following sources: OpenGrey; National Institute of Health RePORTER; Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRPROJ); Hayes, Inc. Health Technology Assessment; The New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Index and Conference Papers Index.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with either individual or cluster randomisation, and prospective, controlled non-randomised studies with a low risk of bias and a sample size of at least 500 participants. In addition to studies eligible for efficacy, we considered any controlled, non-randomised study with a low risk of bias and a study size of at least 500 participants for the assessment of harms. Our population of interest were women between the ages of 40 and 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. None of the studies met our inclusion criteria.

Main Results

Our review did not detect any controlled studies on the use of adjunct ultrasonography for screening in women at average risk for breast cancer. One ongoing randomised controlled trial was identified (J-START, Japan).

Authors' Conclusions

Presently, there is no methodologically sound evidence available justifying the routine use of ultrasonography as an adjunct screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast cancer screening [^f7f07221]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer screening recommendations are based on risk factors. For average-risk women, screening mammography and/or digital breast tomosynthesis is recommended beginning at age 40. Ultrasound (US) may be useful as an adjunct to mammography for incremental cancer detection in women with dense breasts, but the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination should be considered in the decision. For intermediate-risk women, US or MRI may be indicated as an adjunct to mammography depending upon specific risk factors. For women at high risk due to prior mantle radiation between the ages of 10 to 30, mammography is recommended starting 8 years after radiation therapy but not before age 25. For women with a genetic predisposition, annual screening mammography is recommended beginning 10 years earlier than the affected relative at the time of diagnosis but not before age 30. Annual screening MRI is recommended in high-risk women as an adjunct to mammography. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Effect of specialized diagnostic assessment units on the time to diagnosis in screen-detected breast cancer patients [^26b96f5b]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the recent controversy over its efficacy, breast cancer screening remains one of the most important strategies for reducing breast cancer mortality. The benefits of breast cancer screening depend on the timely follow-up of an abnormal mammogram and timely treatment initiation. Delayed diagnosis can lead to increased patient anxiety, the need for more aggressive treatment, and adverse clinical outcomes.

The Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) is an organised provincial screening programme established in 1990 that provides biennial breast screening services accessible to all women aged 50 and older. In 2011, there were 155 OBSP screening sites across the province. The OBSP screened 43.2% of Ontario women aged 50–74 during 2010–2011, and a further 17.6% of women in this age group received screening mammograms ordered by a medical doctor outside of the OBSP, also known as opportunistic screening.

In the usual care route (UC), positive screening mammogram results (either through the OBSP or opportunistically) are sent back to the primary care physician, who must then order diagnostic tests and specialist consultation. This UC route creates a disconnection between screening and assessment that can prolong the diagnostic interval.

The OBSP introduced Breast Assessment Affiliates (BAA) in 2004 to improve the transition between an abnormal screen (or symptomatic presentation) and diagnosis and to ensure access to high-quality diagnostic services. Access to a BAA is through the OBSP or a primary care provider referral (for those who are symptomatic or screened opportunistically). BAAs are based in hospitals or independent facilities and include a multidisciplinary health-care team with a nurse navigator who coordinates diagnostic tests following a detailed pathway and who also provides psychosocial and information support. At a BAA, the performance of diagnostic tests and specialist consultation to investigate a positive screening mammogram does not require referral recommendations from the patient's primary care physician. Diagnostic tests and specialist consultation are directly arranged on the advice of the reading radiologist. BAAs provide care according to the Canadian Association of Radiologist standards and are required to meet OBSP quality thresholds to maintain BAA status. Each BAA must ensure the availability of diagnostic specialists and have sufficient imaging, surgical biopsy and pathological assessment capacity. BAA structure varies. Some provide complete assessment in a single location, whereas others are virtual entities that coordinate diagnostic services across multiple institutions.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^9944e673]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Effect of using the same vs different order for second readings of screening mammograms on rates of breast cancer detection: a randomized clinical trial [^f9fe27a7]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Interpreting screening mammograms is a difficult repetitive task that can result in missed cancers and false-positive recalls. In the United Kingdom, 2 film readers independently evaluate each mammogram to search for signs of cancer and examine digital mammograms in batches. However, a vigilance decrement (reduced detection rate with time on task) has been observed in similar settings.

Objective

To determine the effect of changing the order for the second film reader of batches of screening mammograms on rates of breast cancer detection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, double-blind, cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at 46 specialized breast screening centers from the National Health Service Breast Screening Program in England for 1 year (all between December 20, 2012, and November 3, 2014). Three hundred sixty readers participated (mean, 7.8 readers per center)-186 radiologists, 143 radiography advanced practitioners, and 31 breast clinicians, all fully qualified to report mammograms in the NHS breast screening program.

Interventions

The 2 readers examined each batch of digital mammograms in the same order in the control group and in the opposite order to one another in the intervention group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cancer detection rate; secondary outcomes were rates of recall and disagreements between readers.

Results

Among 1,194,147 women (mean age, 59.3; SD, 7.49) who had screening mammograms (596,642 in the intervention group; 597,505 in the control group), the images were interpreted in 37,688 batches (median batch size, 35; interquartile range [IQR]; 16–46), with each reader interpreting a median of 176 batches (IQR, 96–278). After completion of all subsequent diagnostic tests, a total of 10,484 cases (0.88%) of breast cancer were detected. There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate with 5272 cancers (0.88%) detected in the intervention group vs 5212 cancers (0.87%) detected in the control group (difference, 0.01% points; 95% CI, -0.02% to 0.04% points; recall rate, 24,681 [4.14%] vs 24,894 [4.17%]; difference, -0.03% points; 95% CI, -0.10% to 0.04% points; or rate of reader disagreements, 20,471 [3.43%] vs 20,793 [3.48%]; difference, -0.05% points; 95% CI, -0.11% to 0.02% points).

Conclusions and Relevance

Interpretation of batches of mammograms by qualified screening mammography readers using a different order vs the same order for the second reading resulted in no significant difference in rates of detection of breast cancer.

### Screen-detected breast cancer outcomes by mammography participation in immediate past screening [^29d7865f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is missing the preceding screening round associated with clinically significant detection delays among women with screen-detected breast cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study of 8602 participants, women who did not participate in the immediate past screening round before the diagnostic round had worse tumor characteristics and consequently poorer breast cancer–specific survival during the next 20 years.

Meaning

These findings suggest that women with screen-detected breast cancer who missed their immediate past screening experienced clinically relevant worse outcomes and that advancing the next invitation date for women who miss a screening may improve breast cancer outcomes in this population.

### Management of radiographic lesions of the breast [^c65a049b]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and management of breast disease. From screening asymptomatic patients to evaluating clinical abnormalities on diagnostic studies, breast imaging provides critical information to the breast surgeon. Available imaging studies include those that have been proved over many years, like mammography, and those that take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology, like breast MRI. Image-guided biopsy provides a safe means of evaluating indeterminate findings on imaging. Understanding how these tools are best used can help breast surgeons provide the best care for their patients.

### Utilization and cancer yield of probably benign assessment category in the national mammography database: 2009 to 2018 [^d0045232]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Data on utilization rate and cancer yield of BI-RADS® category 3 in routine clinical practice in diagnostic mammography are sparse. The aim of this study was to determine utilization rate and cancer yield of BI-RADS 3 in diagnostic mammography in the ACR National Mammography Database (NMD).

Methods

Retrospective analysis of NMD mammograms from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2018, was performed. BI-RADS 3 utilization rate in diagnostic setting was calculated and stratified by patient, facility, and examination-level variables. Patient-level cancer yield was calculated among women with BI-RADS 3 assessment and adequate follow-up (imaging follow-up ≥ 24 months or biopsy). Logistic regression was performed to assess the odds of utilization of BI-RADS 3, with respect to facility, examination, and patient variables, and the odds of malignancy among patients with probably benign findings. Chi-square and t tests were used to determine significance (P < .05).

Results

Data from 19,443,866 mammograms from 500 NMD facilities across 31 states were analyzed, of which 3,039,952 were diagnostic mammograms. Utilization rate of BI-RADS 3 was 15.5% (470,155 of 3,039,952) in the diagnostic setting. There was a statistically significant difference in BI-RADS 3 utilization rate across all collected variables (P < .001). Patient-level cancer yield at 2-year follow-up was 0.91% (2,009 of 220,672; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87%-0.95%) in the diagnostic setting. Patient and examination variables associated with significantly higher likelihood of malignancy included calcifications (odds ratio, 4.27; 95% CI, 2.43–7.51), patient age > 70 years (odds ratio, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.49–5.7), and presence of prior comparisons (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07–1.42).

Conclusions

In the NMD, BI-RADS 3 assessment was common in diagnostic mammography (15.5%), with an overall cancer yield of 0.91%, less than the benchmark of 2%. Utilization trends in diagnostic mammography warrant further research for optimization of use.

### Breast cancer screening-NCI… [^199abf7d]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast Cancer Screening Key Points
- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- Mammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer.
- Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.
- Whether a woman should be screened for breast cancer and the screening test to use depends on certain factors.
- Other screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials.
- Breast exam
- Thermography
- Tissue sampling
- Ultrasound exam
- Screening tests for breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Mammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer. A mammogram is a picture of the inside of the breast. Mammography may find tumors that are too small to feel. It may also find ductal carcinoma in situ. In DCIS, abnormal cells line the breast duct, and in some women may become invasive breast cancer.

There are different types of mammograms:

- Screen-film mammography is an x-ray picture of the breast.
- Digital mammography is a computer picture of the breast.
- Digital breast tomosynthesis uses x-rays to take a series of pictures of the inside of the breast from many different angles. A computer is used to make 3-D pictures of the breast from these x-rays.
- Synthetic 2-dimensional mammography uses x-rays to take pictures of the inside of the breast, usually from two different angles. A computer or x-ray film is used to make 2-D pictures of the breast. Many factors affect whether mammography is able to detect breast cancer:

- The age and weight of the patient.
- The size and type of tumor.
- Where the tumor has formed in the breast.
- How sensitive the breast tissue is to hormones.
- How dense the breast tissue is.
- The timing of the mammography within the woman's menstrual cycle.
- The quality of the mammogram picture.
- The skill of the radiologist in reading the mammogram. An MRI is more likely than mammography to find a breast mass that is not cancer. Women with dense breasts who have supplemental screening show higher rates of breast cancer detection, but there is limited evidence about whether this leads to better health outcomes.

Medical outcomes audit requirements — MQSA regulations require that each facility establishes and maintains a mammography medical outcomes audit program, designed to ensure reliability, clarity, and accuracy in the interpretation of mammograms. An audit program allows each facility to follow up BI-RADS categories 4 and 5 assessments, and correlate pathology results with the interpreting physician's findings, and the ACR also strongly recommends follow-up of BI-RADS category 0 assessments. The ACR National Mammography Database provides benchmarks for outcomes data including recall rates, cancer detection rates and positive predictive values.

### Timeliness of breast diagnostic imaging and biopsy in practice: 15 years of collecting, comparing, and defining quality breast cancer care [^f829ca23]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The NQMBC is a time-tested tool for evaluating timeliness of breast cancer care across diverse breast cancer care delivery systems in the USA. Time from screening mammogram to diagnostic mammogram and from diagnostic mammogram to biopsy decreased from 2005 to 2019 (in the era before the COVID-19 pandemic). Successive improvement was seen in each 5-year segment compared with the prior 5 years. There are regional and care delivery differences in timeliness. Centers with the slowest times showed greatest improvement during the time interval, indicating the power of measurement and comparison for improving quality in breast cancer care.

### Accuracy of short-interval follow-up mammograms by patient and radiologist characteristics [^99c66127]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to examine the accuracy of short-interval follow-up mammograms and evaluate patient and radiologist characteristics associated with accuracy.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated 45,007 initial short-interval follow-up mammograms from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium interpreted 3–9 months after a probably benign assessment on a screening or diagnostic examination between 1994 and 2004. We linked these mammograms with patient characteristics and breast cancer diagnoses within 12 months. A subset of short-interval follow-up examinations (n = 13,907) was merged with radiologist characteristics collected from survey data from 130 interpreting radiologists. Using logistic regression, we fit generalized estimating equations to model sensitivity and specificity of short-interval follow-up mammograms by patient and radiologist characteristics.

Results

For every 1,000 women, 8.0 women (0.8%) were diagnosed with breast cancer within 6 months and 11.3 (1.1%) within 12 months. Sensitivity was 83.3% (95% CI, 79.4–87.3%) for cancers diagnosed within 6 months and 60.5% (56.2–64.7%) for those diagnosed within 12 months. Specificity was 97.2% (96.9–97.6%) at 6 months and 97.3% (96.9–97.6%) at 12 months. Sensitivity at 12 months increased among women with unilateral short-interval follow-up mammograms (odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.06–2.29]) and when the interpreting radiologist spent more than 10 hours a week in breast imaging (odds ratio, 3.25 [1.00–10.52]).

Conclusion

Initial short-interval follow-up mammography examinations had a lower sensitivity for detecting breast cancer within 12 months than other diagnostic mammograms (61% for short-interval follow-up vs 80% for diagnostic mammograms reported in the literature). However, sensitivity within the 6-month interval that is usually recommended for subsequent follow-up was 83%. Accuracy of short-interval follow-up mammograms was influenced by few patient and radiologist characteristics.

### Imaging management of palpable breast abnormalities [^53cd3a69]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Women commonly present to imaging departments with a palpable breast abnormality. However, widespread confusion remains regarding the most appropriate sequence and extent of imaging required. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evidence informing current management guidelines for the care of patients with palpable breast abnormalities.

Conclusion

Ultrasound is a highly effective imaging tool for guiding effective evaluation of women with palpable breast abnormalities and should be used for all women with suspicious findings at clinical breast examination. The exception is cases in which mammography shows a clearly benign correlate or a normal, fatty area of breast tissue in the location of the palpable finding. Breast ultrasound should be the primary imaging tool for women with palpable lumps who are pregnant, lactating, or younger than 30 years. For women 40 years old and older, mammography, followed in most cases by ultrasound, is recommended. For women 30–39 years old, ultrasound or mammography may be performed first at the discretion of the radiologist or referring provider. There is little to no role for breast MRI or other advanced imaging technologies in the routine diagnostic evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging after breast surgery [^b98b36b5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that 20% to 40% of women who have percutaneous breast biopsy subsequently undergo breast surgery, knowledge of imaging women with a history of benign (including high-risk) disease or breast cancer is important. For women who had surgery for nonmalignant pathology, the surveillance recommendations are determined by their overall risk. Higher-than-average risk women with a history of benign surgery may require screening mammography starting at an earlier age before 40 and may benefit from screening MRI. For women with breast cancer who have undergone initial excision and have positive margins, imaging with diagnostic mammography or MRI can sometimes guide additional surgical planning. Women who have completed breast conservation therapy for cancer should get annual mammography and may benefit from the addition of MRI or ultrasound to their surveillance regimen. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^9a8ada2e]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mammography

The most common method of screening women for breast cancer is mammography, either offered by an organized program or in the form of opportunistic screening. In most European countries, mammographic screening programs include all women, with age being the only determinant: screening is offered starting at the age of 40–50 years until the age of 64–74 years or even illimitable if women are in good health (e.g. in Austria) at intervals of 1–2 years (3 years in the UK). Population-based effectiveness of mammography screening programs depend on high participation levels, and the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis recommend that at least 70–75% of a population participates in regular mammography screening. Despite the overall survival advantages achieved with the use of mammographic screening, this "one-size-fits-all" approach is associated with several drawbacks, not least that mammography alone is not sufficient to achieve early diagnosis in the high-risk population. It has been reported that program sensitivities of 86–89% in women with largely fatty breasts drop to 62–68% in the case of women with dense breasts (Fig. 1–3). Considering that about 40–50% of women have dense breasts (heterogeneously and extremely dense breast), this represents a non-negligible issue. Breast density category after performing mammography screening should always be reported since this has important implications for the performance of supplemental and/or alternative imaging methods.

Breast density categories according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from the American College of Radiology. Depending on the breast composition, four different categories are identified: a entirely fatty; b scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c heterogeneously dense, which may obscure masses; and (d) extremely dense

Key points
- If a screening mammogram is abnormal, doctors use more tests to find or diagnose breast cancer.
- If breast cancer is diagnosed, other tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. How breast cancer is diagnosed If a screening mammogram is abnormal, doctors use more tests to find out if it is breast cancer. They may refer women to a breast specialist or a surgeon. This does not mean that she has cancer or that she needs surgery. These doctors are experts in diagnosing breast problems. Breast ultrasound. A machine that uses sound waves to make pictures, called sonograms, of areas inside the breast. Diagnostic mammogram. If you have a problem in your breast, such as lumps, or if an area of the breast looks abnormal on a screening mammogram, doctors may have you get a diagnostic mammogram.

This is a test that removes tissue or fluid from the breast to be looked at under a microscope and do more testing. There are different kinds of biopsies. Staging If breast cancer is diagnosed, other tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. Whether the cancer is only in the breast, is found in lymph nodes under your arm, or has spread outside the breast determines your stage of breast cancer.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^50b0dc22]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We used data from 126 US-based radiology facilities in the BCSC to identify subgroups of mammograms with combinations of individual characteristics (age, family history of breast cancer, prior false-positive recall, prior benign biopsy result, and breast density), time since prior mammogram, and screening modality associated with very high, high, moderate, and low recall rates. Radiology facilities could use our results to schedule women for immediate mammographic interpretation and possible same-day diagnostic evaluation on the basis of their capacity to do so. For example, facilities with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to only 5% of mammograms could prioritize first mammograms, which consistently had the highest recall rates of 20% to 23%. Facilities with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to 9% of mammograms could add mammograms in women with ≥ 5 years since prior mammogram. Those with the capacity to offer immediate interpretation to 20% of screening mammograms could add women < 50 years of age with 1 to 4 years since prior mammogram and dense breasts. If facilities prefer a simpler prioritization method to alleviate the burden on the scheduling team eliciting health history questions from the patient or the medical records, they could additionally prioritize all women < 50 years of age regardless of breast density, including the small group of women < 50 years of age with fatty breasts (0.8%) despite being at low risk for recall, thereby considerably reducing the number of women being recalled for diagnostic imaging at a follow-up visit (40.2%) by performing immediate interpretation of only 26% of mammograms.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast cancer screening [^0d363d8c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in intermediate-risk females (personal history of breast cancer, lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or 15–20% lifetime risk of breast cancer). Consider obtaining MRI as an adjunct to mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on risk factors. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### The evolving role of new imaging methods in breast screening [^db563cee]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The potential to avert breast cancer deaths through screening means that efforts continue to identify methods which may enhance early detection. While the role of most new imaging technologies remains in adjunct screening or in the work-up of mammography-detected abnormalities, some of the new breast imaging tests (such as MRI) have roles in screening groups of women defined by increased cancer risk. This paper highlights the evidence and the current role of new breast imaging technologies in screening, focusing on those that have broader application in population screening, including digital mammography, breast ultrasound in women with dense breasts, and computer-aided detection. It highlights that evidence on new imaging in screening comes mostly from non-randomised studies that have quantified test detection capability as adjunct to mammography, or have compared measures of screening performance for new technologies with that of conventional mammography. Two RCTs have provided high-quality evidence on the equivalence of digital and conventional mammography and on outcomes of screen-reading complemented by CAD. Many of these imaging technologies enhance cancer detection but also increase recall and false positives in screening.

### Screening for breast cancer with mammography [^7525be1c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of estimates of the benefits and harms of mammographic screening for breast cancer have been published and national policies vary.

Objectives

To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.

Search Strategy

We searched PubMed (June 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Seven completed and eligible trials involving half a million women were identified. We excluded a biased trial from analysis. Two trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, relative risk (RR) 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.09) at 13 years; four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, RR 0.75 (0.67 to 0.83) (P = 0.02 for difference between the two estimates). RR for all six trials combined was 0.80 (0.73 to 0.88). The two trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, RR 1.02 (0.95 to 1.10) after 10 years, or on all-cause mortality, RR 1.00 (0.96 to 1.04) after 13 years. We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups, RR 1.31 (1.22 to 1.42) for the two adequately randomised trials; the use of radiotherapy was similarly increased.

Authors' Conclusions

Screening likely reduces breast cancer mortality. Based on all trials, the reduction is 20%, but as the effect is lower in the highest quality trials, a more reasonable estimate is a 15% relative risk reduction. Based on the risk level of women in these trials, the absolute risk reduction was 0.05%. Screening also leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, with an estimated 30% increase, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged. In addition, 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be diagnosed as breast cancer patients and will be treated unnecessarily. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. Women invited to screening should be fully informed of both benefits and harms.

### Effect of specialized diagnostic assessment units on the time to diagnosis in screen-detected breast cancer patients [^6c1f4cf9]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

This study had two key strengths. First, it was population-based, thus mitigating any concerns about selection bias. Second, it took advantage of a natural experiment in which DAU use is primarily determined by where a woman lives. This natural experiment assertion is supported by the balanced covariate distribution we observed between the DAU and UC groups and by the fact that our DAU effect did not meaningfully change with adjustment.

This study has several limitations. We were restricted to the study of breast cancer patients rather than all women being investigated for a possible cancer due to the complexity of identifying this latter group in administrative data. Patients with benign diagnosis have been shown to wait longer for a final resolution compared with cancer patients. Our observed DAU's effect is not generalisable to that group. We had to assume that an opportunistic screening mammogram performed within 6 months before diagnosis was abnormal because we did not have the test results. This may have increased the length of the diagnostic interval but errors were unlikely to be associated with DAU status. New physician billing codes specifying the purpose for the mammogram (screening vs diagnostic) as being for screening were introduced in 1 October 2010 and might not have been completely adopted in clinical practice during the study period. So, some opportunistically screened patients may have been left out of our study through use of the old, non-specific mammography code. We think the magnitude of this influence is likely to be small as frequency of use of the new code increased from October through December 2010 and had levelled off by 2011. DAU use determination was subject to misclassification with sensitivity estimated at 90.1% and specificity at 84.6%. This misclassification only applies to the smaller (20.5%) group of patients detected through opportunistic screening. It would have resulted in an underestimate of the difference in time to diagnosis between DAU and UC. In addition, the facilities assigned to the UC route varied in the amount of diagnostic coordination they conducted with some of these facilities containing partial diagnostic assessment services. This variation would have decreased the magnitude of DAU's effect that we were able to observe. Some invasive cancer cases that were included in the study based on histology in the OCR had stage 0 disease in the collaborative staging data. We decided to use histology instead of stage to identify invasive cases, as the OCR's experience with this variable is much longer than its experience with collecting collaborative stage data. We excluded recent immigrants who did not have OHIP coverage in 3 years prior to the diagnosis because of our interest in capturing usual health utilisation patterns. Our study results cannot be generalised to very recent immigrants. We used an area-level proxy measure of socio-economic status based on the smallest census geographic unit available. Differences in individual-level socio-economic status between the DAU and UC groups may have persisted in our adjusted results. Lastly we were not able to measure some potential confounders and others were not measured optimally because of our use of administrative databases. Unmeasured confounding and residual confounding effects might have influenced the study results.

### False-negative screening and diagnostic mammograms in the national mammography database from 2010 to 2022 [^917348c6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: False-negative (FN) mammograms typically delay breast cancer diagnoses and may impact clinical outcomes. However, systematic evaluations of FN mammograms are challenging to conduct due to interval cancers' low incidence. Objective: To evaluate the rates of FN screening and diagnostic mammograms in the National Mammography Database (NMD), and to assess associations of FN rates with patient- and facility-level characteristics. Methods: This retrospective study included all screening and diagnostic mammograms in the NMD performed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2022. Patient- and facility-level factors were extracted from the NMD. FN mammograms were defined as those with a negative result in a patient with a tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within the subsequent 1 year. FN rates per 1000 examinations were computed. Separate multivariable analyses were performed to identify associations with FN results for screening and diagnostic examinations. Results: The analysis included 38,304,525 mammography examinations in 15,585,433 women (mean age, 58.8 ± 11.7 years). Of 32,267,238 screening examinations, the FN rate was 1.9 (minimum, 0.7 in 2010; maximum, 2.5 from 2020 to 2022). Of 6,037,287 diagnostic examinations, the FN rate was 4.0 (minimum, 2.3 in 2010; maximum, 5.4 in 2020). In multivariable analysis for screening examinations, the likelihood of a FN examination was lower for race categories other than White (OR = 0.30–0.95), higher for breast density categories other than almost entirely fatty breasts (OR = 1.60–2.00), higher for women with personal (OR = 3.69) or family (OR = 1.29) history of breast cancer, and higher for academic or university-based facilities (OR = 1.37); for diagnostic examinations, the likelihood of a FN examination was lower for race categories of Asian (OR = 0.91) and Hawaiian (OR = 0.77) and higher for a race category of Black (OR = 1.12), lower for Hispanic patients (OR = 0.70), higher for heterogeneously (OR = 1.46) or extremely (OR = 1.86) dense breasts, higher for women with personal (OR = 7.82) or family (OR = 1.31) history of breast cancer, and higher for academic or university-based facilities (OR = 1.37). Conclusion: Rates of FN screening and diagnostic mammograms increased over time and showed significant associations with patient and facility characteristics. Clinical Impact: Exploration of the causes of the observed associations could inform quality assurance efforts to reduce the risk of delayed breast cancer diagnoses.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® female breast cancer screening: 2023 update [^6f8a967c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Early detection of breast cancer from regular screening substantially reduces breast cancer mortality and morbidity. Multiple different imaging modalities may be used to screen for breast cancer. Screening recommendations differ based on an individual's risk of developing breast cancer. Numerous factors contribute to breast cancer risk, which is frequently divided into three major categories: average, intermediate, and high risk. For patients assigned female at birth with native breast tissue, mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are the recommended method for breast cancer screening in all risk categories. In addition to the recommendation of mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis in high-risk patients, screening with breast MRI is recommended. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals.

### Access to diagnostic mammography in the San Francisco bay area [^574ffdfa]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It is important to assess access to diagnostic mammography because of the high likelihood of breast cancer among women who need diagnostic evaluation. We studied access to diagnostic mammography in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area.

Methods

We identified facilities that provide diagnostic mammography in nine counties in Northern California. We tried to schedule a diagnostic mammogram for a 40-50-year-old simulated patient without health insurance who recently discovered a palpable breast mass. The study had three parts. First, the simulated patient called mammography facilities to schedule a mammogram without a physician's referral; second, she called mammography facilities to schedule a mammogram with a physician's referral; third, she called primary care facilities to schedule a physician's visit in order to obtain a diagnostic mammography referral. For each scenario, our simulated patient recorded the time from the phone call until the first available visit.

Results

Overall, 86 mammography facilities were identified. Only 3 facilities were willing to schedule diagnostic mammography without a physician's referral. With a physician's referral, the median wait time for diagnostic mammography was 5 days (standard deviation [SD] 15 days.) The average wait time to schedule a primary care visit to evaluate the breast mass was longer than to schedule diagnostic mammography (mean wait time for a new primary care visit 38.5 days, SD 62.4 days.)

Conclusions

Access to diagnostic mammography was good in the Greater SF Bay Area if a woman had a physician's referral. It was more difficult to schedule a primary care visit to assess a palpable breast mass than to schedule the diagnostic mammography. Difficulty accessing primary care physicians may contribute to delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer, and this might be particularly relevant for underserved patients who may be less likely to have a primary care provider.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^ed358f45]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### State of the art of current modalities for the diagnosis of breast lesions [^8c743300]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

With the availability of numerous diagnostic techniques comes the possible risk of the unjustified use of such techniques and a lack of rational clinical application. Clearly, errors of this nature would affect the diagnostic accuracy and therefore reduce the possibilities for treatment. It is not uncommon for women and also for general practitioners to be misinformed about which is the most suitable technique or rather, which is the best combination of the various techniques. For this reason, inappropriate tests are often requested or, conversely, there is failure to request tests which would in fact make a useful contribution to safeguarding the patient's health. This work has the following aims: (a) to set out precisely the real diagnostic contribution of each method, both radiological and otherwise, and suggest methods of application and indications consistent with the state of the art, and (b) to suggest the most effective and rational combinations of the various techniques and organisation of diagnostic activities.

### Is there a role for magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing palpable breast masses when mammogram and ultrasound are negative? [^789fe36a]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for screening high-risk patients is well established. However, the role of MRI as a diagnostic problem-solving tool is less well studied. With the increasing availability of MRI, its use for problem solving has increased. This small retrospective study examines the use and utility of breast MRI in evaluating palpable breast masses with negative diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound studies.

Methods

We reviewed our breast MRI database, selecting breast MRI studies performed to assess palpable abnormalities with negative mammogram and ultrasound findings. Evidence of cancer was determined by biopsy.

Results

Seventy-seven studies were included, comprising 1.3% of all breast MRI studies performed at our institution during the study period (2005–2011). Twenty-two patients underwent biopsy, and 55 were followed clinically without biopsy. Approximately half (27 of 55) of the patients without biopsy were lost to follow-up after negative MRI, and the rest had no evidence of cancer on imaging or clinical examination at 1 year. Of the 22 patients who underwent biopsy, 2 were diagnosed with cancer, both with positive MRI studies. Sensitivity of MRI when compared to tissue diagnosis was 100%, and specificity was 70%. Positive and negative predictive values were 25% and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

When used for evaluation of a palpable breast mass with negative traditional imaging, breast MRI likely offers low yield of cancer diagnosis and low specificity. Negative MRI results may cause a low compliance rate for recommended follow-up. Because a biopsy is indicated for persistent palpable masses, the addition of diagnostic MRI only adds another step, with associated costs and burdens.

### Reactions to uncertainty and the accuracy of diagnostic mammography [^e4fb703f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Reactions to uncertainty in clinical medicine can affect decision making.

Objective

To assess the extent to which radiologists' reactions to uncertainty influence diagnostic mammography interpretation.

Design

Cross-sectional responses to a mailed survey assessed reactions to uncertainty using a well-validated instrument. Responses were linked to radiologists' diagnostic mammography interpretive performance obtained from three regional mammography registries.

Participants

One hundred thirty-two radiologists from New Hampshire, Colorado, and Washington.

Measurement

Mean scores and either standard errors or confidence intervals were used to assess physicians' reactions to uncertainty. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit via generalized estimating equations to assess the impact of uncertainty on diagnostic mammography interpretive performance while adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

When examining radiologists' interpretation of additional diagnostic mammograms (those after screening mammograms that detected abnormalities), a 5-point increase in the reactions to uncertainty score was associated with a 17% higher odds of having a positive mammogram given cancer was diagnosed during follow-up (sensitivity), a 6% lower odds of a negative mammogram given no cancer (specificity), a 4% lower odds (not significant) of a cancer diagnosis given a positive mammogram (positive predictive value [PPV]), and a 5% higher odds of having a positive mammogram (abnormal interpretation).

Conclusion

Mammograms interpreted by radiologists who have more discomfort with uncertainty have higher likelihood of being recalled.

Diagnostic evaluation for abnormal clinical findings — imaging and tissue sampling. Women with abnormal findings on initial clinical examination require further evaluation, and additional testing can include diagnostic imaging and tissue sampling. Often, positive findings on the initial evaluation of a woman who has breast-related symptoms will require diagnostic breast imaging with ultrasonography, mammography, or digital tomosynthesis, with management dependent on the patient's age, clinical suspicion, the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category, and other imaging characteristics. Based on clinical or imaging findings, a tissue diagnosis may be indicated.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^af5f3906]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, USPSTF 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasound or MRI in females identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.

### Prioritizing screening mammograms for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation on the basis of risk for recall [^fd0ca021]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study is one of the largest evaluations of recall rates using data representative of recent US practice. Nonetheless, our study had several limitations. We did not include women with personal histories of breast cancer because diagnostic views were often performed during the screening examination, and we could not determine if these diagnostic views were part of surveillance imaging or for the evaluation of a new finding. Although prior research has shown higher recall rates when comparison images are unavailable to the reading radiologist, most facilities in the BCSC do not provide data on comparison image availability. However, among subsequent screening examinations with complete information on comparison images, only 0.8% indicated no comparison films. Other approaches to identify mammograms at high risk for recall should be explored. For example, artificial intelligence algorithms applied directly to the mammographic images while a woman waits may help in determining which screening mammograms are likely to be recalled and thus who should receive immediate interpretation and diagnostic workup. We did not evaluate cancer detection rates or which recalled examinations are likely to have true-positive findings. Facilities with a limited capacity to offer immediate interpretation could further prioritize by risk for having a cancer detected. Our models focused on identifying women at high risk for recall and did not consider the risk of not returning if recalled. Future studies should consider how to balance the risk for recall and the risk of not returning when prioritizing immediate interpretation and diagnostic workup. Although we hypothesize our approach for prioritizing immediate interpretation and diagnostic imaging will improve compliance with additional workup on the basis of prior studies, we did not directly evaluate this.

In conclusion, time since prior mammogram and age were the most important risk factors associated with high and very high risk for recall, regardless of facility-level characteristics. Scheduling baseline mammograms and women with ≥ 5 years since prior mammogram for immediate interpretation and diagnostic evaluation could avert one-fifth of recalls for diagnostic imaging at follow-up visits, reducing diagnostic delays and patient anxiety.
