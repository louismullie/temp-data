## Question

DVT treatment heparin monitoring parameters

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treatment, including when to use aPTT versus anti-Xa, how to set therapeutic ranges, how often to check labs, and what to do in special populations and scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why UFH is chosen over LMWH. Then, I should verify the primary monitoring test and its validated therapeutic range. Next, I will examine the alternative anti-Xa assay and when it is preferred. After that, I need to check the monitoring cadence and dose-adjustment algorithms. I will then review safety monitoring for bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Finally, I should consider special populations and summarize a practical, stepwise approach with caveats and corrections where needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. UFH is typically reserved for DVT when rapid reversibility is needed, in renal failure, in pregnancy, or when LMWH is unavailable or contraindicated, whereas LMWH is preferred for most patients because of predictable pharmacokinetics and no routine monitoring needs. This frames why we are discussing UFH monitoring at all [^117LhKW7] [^111icyia].

> I need to verify the primary monitoring test. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is the standard test for UFH titration, but wait, let me verify the therapeutic range because it is reagent-specific and often misquoted as a fixed ratio. The historical 1.5–2.5 times control heuristic is unreliable across platforms, and the FDA label supports a target of 1.5–2.0 times normal, which still requires local validation against heparin concentration or anti-Xa activity to ensure clinical equivalence to 0.3–0.7 IU/mL anti-Xa [^113CKp2u] [^116GT7TF] [^111w1u6k].

> Hold on, I should verify the alternative assay. Anti-factor Xa activity correlates more directly with heparin concentration and is less affected by acute-phase reactants like fibrinogen and factor VIII. However, I should double-check whether outcomes differ between aPTT and anti-Xa monitoring, and the best available evidence shows no significant differences in bleeding or thrombosis, so either can be used if locally validated, with anti-Xa favored when aPTT is discordant or confounded [^112YRuDX] [^1146J2VL] [^112rypuu].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence. Initially, I was going to say check aPTT every 6 hours, but wait, the FDA labeling recommends checking aPTT approximately every 4 hours after initiation or dose changes until stable, then at appropriate intervals. For subcutaneous UFH, mid-interval aPTT measured about 6 hours post-injection is reasonable, and I need to ensure platelet counts are obtained at baseline and periodically to screen for HIT [^113CKp2u] [^113bM71p] [^112Kgv8B].

> I will now examine dose-adjustment frameworks. Weight-based nomograms for IV UFH improve time to therapeutic aPTT; similarly, weight-adjusted subcutaneous UFH regimens can be used, and I should confirm that some outpatient protocols allow fixed, unmonitored SC UFH dosing, though this is a conditional recommendation and requires careful patient selection and institutional protocols [^114XfzXF] [^115Fp1ZY].

> Let me consider safety monitoring beyond aPTT or anti-Xa. I need to ensure platelet counts are monitored from day 4 to day 14 in patients without recent heparin exposure to detect HIT, with earlier and more frequent checks if there was recent heparin exposure. I should also confirm that periodic hematocrit and stool occult blood testing are advised during heparin therapy to detect occult bleeding [^112Kgv8B] [^115i1r16] [^1127UwFY].

> But wait, what if the aPTT and anti-Xa do not align. Discordance is common, especially with elevated fibrinogen or factor VIII, and in such cases I should favor anti-Xa for dose titration to avoid under- or over-anticoagulation. I should double-check that local lab characteristics are known because inter-reagent variability is a major driver of discordance [^116GT7TF] [^112rypuu] [^115M7J2U].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred, but if UFH is used, aPTT monitoring is less reliable and anti-Xa may be considered. In pediatrics, higher UFH doses are often required and anti-Xa may outperform aPTT, so I need to ensure age-appropriate targets and consistent use of one assay. In obesity, anti-Xa can help navigate altered pharmacokinetics. In renal failure, UFH is preferred over LMWH for treatment dosing due to clearance considerations, reinforcing the need for vigilant aPTT or anti-Xa monitoring [^112nAs7E] [^111dC8Wg] [^113bM71p] [^111icyia].

> I should confirm the practical, stepwise approach. Start UFH with a validated weight-based regimen, obtain baseline aPTT, INR, and platelet count, recheck aPTT about 4 hours after initiation or dose changes until stable, then monitor daily; if aPTT is discordant or confounded, switch to anti-Xa and titrate to 0.3–0.7 IU/mL; monitor platelets for HIT and watch for bleeding; overlap with warfarin until INR is therapeutic for at least 24 hours and total heparin duration is at least 5 days [^113CKp2u] [^116ceJ2x] [^116GT7TF].

> Let me reconsider and summarize to ensure internal consistency. UFH for DVT is monitored primarily with aPTT using a locally validated therapeutic range that corresponds to 0.3–0.7 IU/mL anti-Xa, with anti-Xa as an acceptable alternative when aPTT is unreliable; check aPTT frequently early on, monitor platelets for HIT, and tailor for special populations; evidence does not show superiority of anti-Xa over aPTT for hard outcomes, so the choice should be guided by local validation and clinical context [^116GT7TF] [^112YRuDX] [^113CKp2u].

---

For DVT treatment with heparin, **monitor aPTT every 4–6 hours** [^113CKp2u] after initiation or dose changes until stable, then daily; target a therapeutic aPTT of 1.5–2.5 times the baseline [^116GT7TF] or an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL [^116nSAFJ] if aPTT is unreliable [^111w1u6k]. Also check **platelet counts every 2–3 days** from day 4–14 to detect HIT [^115i1r16], and monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit for bleeding. Routine anti-Xa monitoring is not required for LMWH [^113Sm1Za] but may be considered in obesity, renal impairment, or pregnancy [^1123AFc6]. Adjust dosing to keep aPTT in range, and switch to anti-Xa if discordant or in special populations [^111icyia].

## Monitoring parameters for unfractionated heparin (UFH)

### Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)

- **Frequency**: Check aPTT every 4–6 hours after initiation or dose changes until stable, then daily [^113CKp2u] [^11437bW7].

- **Therapeutic range**: Target 1.5–2.5 times baseline [^116GT7TF] (typically 60–85 seconds [^114V9wL3]), but validate locally due to reagent variability [^111w1u6k].

- **Dose adjustment**: Titrate to maintain aPTT in the therapeutic range; use institutional nomograms [^116nSAFJ].

---

### Anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels

- **Indication**: Use when aPTT is unreliable (e.g. lupus anticoagulant, high fibrinogen, heparin resistance) [^111icyia] or in special populations (obesity, renal impairment, pregnancy) [^1123AFc6].

- **Therapeutic range**: 0.3–0.7 IU/mL [^116nSAFJ].

- **Frequency**: Measure every 4–6 hours initially until stable, then daily.

---

### Platelet count monitoring

Check a **baseline platelet count** before starting heparin [^114vWZwd], then monitor every 2–3 days from days 4–14 [^112Kgv8B] [^115i1r16] to detect HIT. Suspect HIT if the platelet count falls by > 50% or drops below 100,000/µL; if suspected, stop heparin and start a non-heparin anticoagulant [^115mcuX6].

---

### Hemoglobin and hematocrit

Monitor for **bleeding** by checking hemoglobin and hematocrit regularly during therapy.

---

## Monitoring parameters for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

### Anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels

Routine monitoring is **not required** for LMWH due to predictable pharmacokinetics [^113Sm1Za]. Consider monitoring in obesity, renal impairment, or pregnancy, targeting peak anti-Xa of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL (drawn 4 hours post-dose) [^1123AFc6] [^113Sm1Za].

---

### Platelet count monitoring

Obtain a **baseline platelet count** and monitor periodically; the risk of HIT is lower than with UFH but not zero [^113J1nBv].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with monitoring

- **Recurrent thromboembolism**: Maintaining therapeutic aPTT or anti-Xa reduces recurrence [^114V9wL3].

- **Bleeding complications**: Supratherapeutic levels increase bleeding risk; monitor and adjust dosing to minimize this [^112qvxe3].

- **HIT**: Early detection via platelet monitoring prevents thrombotic complications [^notfound].

---

## Heparin monitoring parameters for DVT treatment

| **Parameter** | **UFH** | **LMWH** |
|-|-|-|
| aPTT | Every 4–6 hours until stable, then daily | Not routinely monitored |
| Anti-Xa | Use if aPTT unreliable or in special populations | Not routinely monitored; consider in obesity, renal impairment, pregnancy |
| Platelet count | Baseline, then every 2–3 days (days 4–14) | Baseline, then periodic |
| Hemoglobin/hematocrit | Regularly during therapy | Regularly during therapy |

---

## Special considerations

- **Obesity**: May require anti-Xa monitoring and dose adjustment [^1123AFc6].

- **Renal impairment**: Anti-Xa monitoring may be needed; adjust dose as indicated [^113Sm1Za].

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer LMWH; consider anti-Xa monitoring if using LMWH [^112nAs7E].

---

Effective DVT management with heparin requires **aPTT or anti-Xa monitoring** [^116GT7TF] to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation, plus platelet surveillance for HIT [^112Kgv8B] and hemoglobin/hematocrit checks for bleeding. LMWH generally needs no routine monitoring, but anti-Xa levels may be used in obesity, renal impairment, or pregnancy [^113Sm1Za].

CDT. Usual adult initial dosing of t-PA for DVT is in the range of 0.5 mg/h to 1 mg/h. For children, weight-based dosing of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per hour has been reported with a maximum of 2 mg/h. In case series of pediatric patients with PE treated with CDT, weight-based dosing of 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg per hour up to a maximum dose of 2 mg/h was used.

CONCOMITANT ANTICOAGULATION WITH THROMBOLYSIS. There is no consensus for the concomitant use of heparin with thrombolysis. With standard-dose infusions of t-PA, the bleeding risk may be increased with the use of anticoagulation and there is limited experience for its safety. However, in published regimens with low-dose systemic thrombolysis or CDT, UFH is commonly used. Both low-dose UFH (5–10 U/kg per hour) and therapeutic UFH have been reported. Less commonly, LMWH has also been used with thrombolysis but is not usually recommended because of safety concerns, given that LMWH has a longer half-life and is less readily reversible compared with UFH.

Monitoring

There is no therapeutic range for thrombolytic agents; however, fibrinogen levels, aPTT, and prothrombin time are commonly monitored during thrombolytic infusions. t-PA binds to clot-bound fibrin; however, systemic depletion of fibrinogen may be observed. Fibrinogen values of < 150 mg/dL have been associated with increased bleeding.

AEs

Between 10% and 40% of patients treated with t-PA will experience major AEs. The most common AE is bleeding, and bleeding is more likely in patients who weighed less, had a longer duration of therapy, a greater decrease in fibrinogen levels, and who failed to have resolution of their clot. Hypersensitivity reactions are among the less common AEs described with t-PA use. Allergic reactions have been reported and resolve with conventional treatment methods.

Periprocedural management

Although it has a very short half-life (5 minutes), fibrinolytic effects of t-PA may continue for up to 1 hour after discontinuation. Thus, the infusion should be discontinued accordingly in preparation for any procedure(s).

Recommendation 17

For pediatric patients with VTE, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using DOACs (rivaroxaban/dabigatran) over SOC anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin [UFH], vitamin K antagonists [VKAs], and fondaparinux; conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: The panel concluded that there was a small benefit of DOACs over SOC, in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence rate and increased rate of thrombus resolution. The undesirable effects of DOACs vs SOC were felt to be small, with a reduction in major bleeding albeit with an increase in clinically relevant non major bleeding (CRNMB). The panel acknowledged the limitations of these data when evaluating the outcomes of mortality, recurrence, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), and major/CRNMB due to the small number of events reported. Given the natural history of PTS and thrombus recurrence, evaluation at 3 to 6 months was considered to be too soon to provide accurate representation of these outcomes. The monitoring of drug level and dose adjustment of dabigatran during the DIVERSITY trial raised concern about the potential effect on efficacy and safety of routine use according to current approvals, which do not require such monitoring. Although data on QOL, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of an oral agent that does not require monitoring were lacking, the panel felt that these were important factors when making this recommendation.

Recommendation 18

For pediatric patients with VTE the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using rivaroxaban over SOC anticoagulants (LMWH, UFH, VKA, and fondaparinux; conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: The panel concluded that there was a small benefit of rivaroxaban over SOC, in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence and improved thrombus resolution. The undesirable effects of rivaroxaban vs SOC were felt to be small, with a reduction in major bleeding countered by an increase in CRNMB. These data were limited by the small number of important outcomes that were reported, that is mortality, recurrence, PTS, and major bleeding/CRNMB. The panel noted that some individuals were excluded from the EINSTEIN-Junior trial, including those aged < 6 months with low birth weight and those with severe liver or renal impairment. The panel also noted reports of heavier menstrual bleeding while on rivaroxaban and felt that this was an important consideration when choosing an anticoagulant.

ASH 2019 venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention — outcomes, subgroup handling, and safety monitoring are defined as follows: The panel rated as critical for decision making "mortality, symptomatic PEs, symptomatic proximal DVTs, symptomatic severe distal DVTs, major bleeding, and reoperation", and determined that "all symptomatic proximal DVTs and PEs confirmed by objective diagnostic imaging were considered of moderate severity and were clinically important", while "only 'severe' distal DVTs were rated as clinically important distal DVTs". Where possible, analyses used studies "that reported symptomatic outcome events", and "in the absence of reports of symptomatic VTE… modeling was performed using estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic DVTs that would become clinically important symptomatic events". Major bleeding definitions from individual studies were applied, with the exception that "the need for a blood transfusion itself was not considered major bleeding unless other criteria for major bleeding were met", and "the definition of reoperation was not specific for reoperation caused by or related to major bleeding". Studies included cancer and noncancer populations; analyses "tested potential differences… with > 50% and < 50% of participants with cancer", and "subgroup analyses did not demonstrate a difference… [so] recommendations do not distinguish between cancer and noncancer patients". For prophylaxis methods, the panel "advises to follow manufacturer's recommendations regarding patient-specific restrictions… (such as levels of renal function for patients receiving LMWHs or DOACs)" and "advises periodic monitoring of the platelet count for patients receiving LMWH and, in particular, UFH, as postoperative prophylaxis in consideration of the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia".

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^116cnEcC]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT thrombolysis — prevention of bleeding emphasizes technical access, dose limits, and monitoring. It should be confirmed that venous access was routinely obtained with US guidance and a micropuncture needle, and the popliteal vein may be used as the preferred access site. When recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is used, weight-based dosing at 0.01 mg/kg/h (not to exceed 1.0 mg/h) is recommended. Monitoring should include blood draws for hematocrit, platelet count, and PTT at least every 12 hours, and serial fibrinogen monitoring during CDT may help to prevent complications. It should be confirmed that arterial punctures and intramuscular injections did not occur during thrombolysis, and that thrombolytic progress was assessed by venography at least every 24 hours. For unfractionated heparin, subtherapeutic dosing — 1.2–1.7 times the control PTT — was reasonably effective and safe in one randomized trial, and low molecular weight heparin at twice-daily, weight-based, FDA-approved dosing may also be a safe method during CDT/PCDT though data are limited. One small study suggests argatroban may also be safe, but heparin-based therapy should be preferred in patients without contraindications until larger studies are available.

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [^115ZNu6w]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attack and stroke. Sequelae occurring after venous thromboembolism include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis share common risk factors and the common pathophysiological characteristics of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Clinical probability assessment helps to identify patients with low clinical probability for whom the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can be excluded solely with a negative result from a plasma D-dimer test. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with compression ultrasound showing deep vein thrombosis or with chest CT showing pulmonary embolism. Most patients with venous thromboembolism will respond to anticoagulation, which is the foundation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary embolism should undergo risk stratification to establish whether they will benefit from the addition of advanced treatment, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy. Several novel oral anticoagulant drugs are in development. These drugs, which could replace vitamin K antagonists and heparins in many patients, are prescribed in fixed doses and do not need any coagulation monitoring in the laboratory. Although rigorous clinical trials have reported the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prevention with low, fixed doses of anticoagulant drugs, prophylaxis remains underused in patients admitted to hospital at moderate risk and high risk for venous thromboembolism. In this Seminar, we discuss pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis of the legs.

### Anticoagulation monitoring part 2: unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin [^1172LYqC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the availability, mechanisms, limitations, and clinical application of point-of-care (POC) devices used in monitoring anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs).

Data Sources

Articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-August 2004), device manufacturer Web sites, additional references listed in articles and Web sites, and abstracts from scientific meetings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature from clinical trials was reviewed to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and clinical application of POC monitoring devices.

Data Synthesis

The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) are common tests for monitoring anticoagulation with UFH. Multiple devices are available for POC aPTT, ACT, and heparin concentration testing. The aPTT therapeutic range for UFH will vary depending upon the reagent and instrument employed. Although recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Seventh Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy, establishing a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for UFH is rarely performed. Additional research evaluating anti-factor Xa monitoring of LMWHs using POC testing is necessary.

Conclusions

Multiple POC devices are available to monitor anticoagulation with UFH. For each test, there is some variability in results between devices and between reagents used in the same device. Despite these limitations, POC anticoagulation monitoring of UFH using aPTT and, more often, ACT is common in clinical practice, particularly when evaluating anticoagulation associated with interventional cardiology procedures and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### Treatment and management of acute venous thromboembolic disease [^1138t7qF]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease consists of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Either low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously or unfractionated heparin administered intravenously are used for the initial treatment. Simultaneously, warfarin therapy is initiated. Thrombolytic therapy plays a limited role. Following the initial heparin treatment, anticoagulation clinics provide an excellent means of monitoring the oral anticoagulation. Patient education is important and patients should be well versed in the basic features of oral anticoagulation. The duration of oral anticoagulation is dependent on a number of factors including the presence of inherited risk factors, bleeding risk and patient reliability. Residual thrombus in the affected vein may indicate the need for prolonged anticoagulation. The low intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 1.5–2.0) is useful in preventing recurrent thrombosis following the initial treatment period with full intensity oral anticoagulation.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113Sm1Za]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets — coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

Therapeutic range

A therapeutic range for heparin was derived from experimental animal studies in which the whole-blood clotting time was used. A prospective study using aPTT for monitoring heparin therapy in adult patients with VTE showed that the risk of recurrent VTE was associated with failure to obtain an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value and that a heparin concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration correlated with this aPTT range. This aPTT ratio became the standard for the lower limit of the therapeutic range in adults.

A therapeutic range for UFH in children is largely extrapolated from adult studies and recommend targeting an aPTT range that reﬂects a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, but this has yet to be confirmed by RCTs. The measured response to the aPTT and the anti-FXa varies between reagents and instruments used to measure these tests. Additionally, there are multiple variations to the anti-FXa assay that change the response to UFH, and there are no data to confirm which test variation is clinically optimal. Therefore, clinicians must understand the specifics/pitfalls of the tests run in their laboratories.

The evidence for adjusting the dose of heparin to maintain a therapeutic range is weak and is based on a post hoc subgroup analysis of a descriptive study. There is a paucity of data on the performance of the aPTT or anti-FXa for UFH monitoring in children, and a therapeutic UFH dose targeting an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds and anti-FXa activity of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL is most commonly used.

### Heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111icyia]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article about unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. UFH is a heterogeneous mixture of glycosaminoglycans that bind to antithrombin via a pentasaccharide, catalyzing the inactivation of thrombin and other clotting factors. UFH also binds endothelial cells, platelet factor 4, and platelets, leading to rather unpredictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Variability in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents necessitates site-specific validation of the aPTT therapeutic range in order to properly monitor UFH therapy. Lack of validation has been an oversight in many clinical trials comparing UFH to LMWH. In patients with apparent heparin resistance, anti-factor Xa monitoring may be superior to measurement of aPTT. LMWHs lack the nonspecific binding affinities of UFH, and, as a result, LMWH preparations have more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. LMWHs have replaced UFH for most clinical indications for the following reasons: (1) these properties allow LMWHs to be administered subcutaneously, once daily without laboratory monitoring; and (2) the evidence from clinical trials that LMWH is as least as effective as and is safer than UFH. Several clinical issues regarding the use of LMWHs remain unanswered. These relate to the need for monitoring with an anti-factor Xa assay in patients with severe obesity or renal insufficiency. The therapeutic range for anti-factor Xa activity depends on the dosing interval. Anti-factor Xa monitoring is prudent when administering weight-based doses of LMWH to patients who weigh > 150 kg. It has been determined that UFH infusion is preferable to LMWH injection in patients with creatinine clearance of < 25 mL/min, until further data on therapeutic dosing of LMWHs in renal failure have been published. However, when administered in low doses prophylactically, LMWH is safe for therapy in patients with renal failure. Protamine may help to reverse bleeding related to LWMH, although anti-factor Xa activity is not fully normalized by protamine. The synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux is a promising new antithrombotic agent for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing and monitoring in children are outlined, including an initial loading dose range, therapeutic target, and a monitoring recommendation. A loading dose of 75 to 100 IU/kg is reported to achieve therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in most children, and the maintenance dose needed to reach the adult therapeutic range corresponding to an anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 is higher in neonates than older children and is gestational age dependent. Both aPTT and anti-FXa are used clinically, but studies show poor correlation and no superiority for predicting thrombosis or bleeding; therefore, we suggest that clinicians consistently use 1 test to monitor patients on UFH anticoagulation.

### Clinical outcomes with unfractionated heparin monitored by anti-factor Xa vs. activated partial thromboplastin time [^1146J2VL]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) monitoring of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is associated with less time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation compared to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, it is unknown whether clinical outcomes differ between these methods of monitoring. The aim of this research was to compare the rate of venous thrombosis and bleeding events in patients that received UFH monitored by anti-Xa compared to the aPTT. A retrospective review of electronic health records identified adult patients that received UFH given intravenously (IV) for ≥ 2days, with either anti-Xa or aPTT monitoring at an academic tertiary care hospital. This was a pre/post study design conducted between January 1 to December 30, 2014 (aPTT), and January 1 to December 30, 2016 (anti-Xa). All UFH adjustments were based on institutional nomograms. The primary outcome was venous thrombosis and the secondary outcome was bleeding, both of which occurred between UFH administration and discharge from the index hospitalization. A total of 2500 patients were in the anti-Xa group and 2847 patients aPTT group. Venous thrombosis occurred in 10.2% vs 10.8% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.49). Bleeding occurred in 33.7% vs 33.6% of patients in the anti-Xa and aPTT groups, respectively (P = 0.94). Anti-Xa monitoring was not an independent predictor of either outcome in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study found no difference in clinical outcomes between anti-Xa and aPTT-based monitoring of UFH IV.

### Suboptimal monitoring and dosing of unfractionated heparin in comparative studies with low-molecular-weight heparin [^111w1u6k]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Site-specific validation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic range is required to ensure administration of the optimal dose of unfractionated heparin. Therapeutic ranges of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control value are subtherapeutic for most modern aPTT reagents.

Purpose

To audit the appropriateness of aPTT monitoring in clinical trials comparing unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with venous thromboembolism.

Data Sources

Search of PubMed database from 1984 to 2001.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that compared unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Data Extraction

Use of unvalidated and potentially suboptimal therapeutic ranges for aPTT in patients assigned to receive unfractionated heparin.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. Only 3 studies used a validated aPTT therapeutic range, and 11 studies used a range that included aPTT values 1.5 times the control value. Ten studies reported unfractionated heparin doses, and 7 of these documented a reduction to less than 30 000 U/d in response to aPTT results.

Conclusions

Most studies monitored unfractionated heparin inappropriately. This shortcoming could be responsible for the reduced efficacy of unfractionated heparin in clinical trials.

Dabigatran

The pivotal published study on dabigatran was RECOVER I, which enrolled patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This was a phase III non-inferiority, double blind, double dummy trial, which included sham monitoring of international normalised ratio and sham titration of vitamin K antagonists in the experimental group. To obtain regulatory approval, the study was repeated (RECOVER II) with a similar design and the results published in abstract. Both patients who received dabigatran and those who received vitamin K antagonists received a full five day course of low molecular weight heparin before starting the study drug.

Ximelagatran

We found two published studies that looked at ximelagatran. THRIVE I was a short phase II study (n = 138) on patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with an imaging endpoint.THRIVE I also reported event data. The phase III, THRIVE II and THRIVE V studies were reported together as one trial (referred to as THRIVE II/V in this study). The THRIVE II/V trial enrolled 2489 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism in a double blind, double dummy randomised design similar to the RECOVER studies for dabigatran. Patients randomised to ximelagatran received dummy low molecular weight heparin with dummy vitamin K antagonists during the initial phase of the study.

Risk of bias assessment

Of the nine studies, we assessed the risk of bias as low in four studies and unclear in five studies (table 1). In the open label studies (with the exception of the THRIVE I study), outcome data were recorded with a routine structured technique and were adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to study drug allocation. In three of the five studies graded as having unclear potential for bias this was due to only a single domain, with all other domains classified as low potential for bias. One study (RECOVER II) has been published only in abstract form, so we could not completely assess potential biases or extract demographic data. As its design was similar to RECOVER I, however, we assumed that its potential bias would be either low or unclear at most. The funnel plots indicated low risk of publication bias for all analyses (see supplementary fig 1).

### Algorithm for subcutaneous heparin treatment of DVT… [^11437bW7]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities are usually treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. Nomograms may help to determine the rate of intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin that ensures prompt, adequate anticoagulation. Subcutaneous heparin has been shown to be as effective and safe as intravenous heparin. Prandoni and associates devised a weight-based algorithm for subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin following administration of an intravenous loading dose. Seventy symptomatic outpatients with a first episode of proximal venous thrombosis were given an intravenous bolus of sodium heparin and a subcutaneous injection of calcium heparin in dosages adjusted according to body weight.

The activated partial thromboplastin time was first measured after six hours, and subsequent dosage adjustments during the first 48 hours were scheduled according to the algorithm. The aPTT was performed in the mid-interval. After the first 48 hours, heparin administration was managed on the basis of daily aPTT determinations. Therapy was discontinued if the International Normalized Ratio was greater than 2 for two consecutive days in patients who had received heparin for at least five days and who started sodium warfarin therapy on the first or second day. Therapy with sodium warfarin was continued for 12 weeks, and patients were followed after one and three months. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Proper anticoagulation was achieved in 87 percent of patients within 24 hours and in 99 percent of patients within 48 hours.

None of the patients had major bleeding or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism recurred in only three patients. The mean daily amount of heparin required to prolong the aPTT during the first 24 hours was greater than the dosage usually required with intravenous heparin administration. The authors conclude that the use of a weight-based algorithm for the subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin may simplify the initial treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders. This regimen allows early patient mobilization and early discharge of appropriate patients. This approach is significantly less expensive than similar treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins.

### New anticoagulant drugs for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113wm4Gw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and atrial fibrillation are common conditions in Western countries. The mainstay of treatment and prevention for these diseases is fast-acting anticoagulant drugs such as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The use of these drugs is, however, complex and demanding for both patients and physicians. Recently, new antithrombotic drugs that act directly by inhibiting activated coagulation factors such as factor X or thrombin have been developed and investigated in phase III clinical trials. The aim of this article is to review: (i) the need to develop new drugs; (ii) their efficacy/safety as demonstrated in clinical trials; (iii) the need for laboratory monitoring and (iv) the direction towards the use of these new drugs in the real-life clinical situation.

Use of UFH when LMWH cannot be used or is preferred — UFH can be given as initial IV therapy followed by adjusted-dose subcutaneous UFH every 12 h or as twice-daily adjusted-dose subcutaneous UFH; with subcutaneous therapy, UFH doses should be adjusted to prolong a midinterval activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measured 6 h postinjection into the therapeutic range, recognizing aPTT monitoring is less reliable in pregnancy; the use of fondaparinux is described as inadvisable in pregnancy; routine anti-Xa monitoring with LMWH is stated as difficult to justify.

### Tinzaparin sodium (Innohep) [^117HusiA]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tinzaparin sodium is a low molecular weight heparin with antithrombotic properties. Tinzaparin sodium inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood including the formation of fibrin clots, both in vitro and in vivo. It acts as a potent co-inhibitor of several activated coagulation factors, especially Factors Xa and IIa (thrombin). The primary inhibitory activity is mediated through the plasma protease inhibitor, antithrombin.

Bleeding time is usually unaffected by tinzaparin sodium. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged by therapeutic doses of tinzaparin sodium used in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prothrombin time (PT) may be slightly prolonged with tinzaparin sodium treatment but usually remains within the normal range. Neither aPTT nor PT can be used for therapeutic monitoring of tinzaparin sodium.

Neither unfractionated heparin nor tinzaparin sodium have intrinsic fibrinolytic activity; therefore, they do not lyse existing clots. Tinzaparin sodium induces release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which may contribute to the antithrombotic effect. Heparin is also known to have a variety of actions that are independent of its anticoagulant effects. These include interactions with endothelial cell growth factors, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of lipoprotein lipase, suppression of aldosterone secretion, and induction of platelet aggregation.

Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics

Anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities are the primary biomarkers for assessing tinzaparin sodium exposure because plasma concentrations of low molecular weight heparins cannot be measured directly. Because of analytical assay limitations, anti-Xa activity is the more widely used biomarker. The measurements of anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities in plasma serve as surrogates for the concentrations of molecules which contain the high-affinity binding site for antithrombin (anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities). Monitoring patients based on anti-Xa activity is generally not advised. The data are provided in Figure 1 and Table 2. below.

Studies with tinzaparin sodium in healthy volunteers and patients have been conducted with both fixed- and weight-adjusted dose administration. Recommended therapy with tinzaparin sodium is based on weight-adjusted dosing (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

2.2	Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injections.

Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

2.4	Pediatric Use

Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116rAoYV]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Heparin selection and monitoring in critically ill COVID-19 with proximal DVT or PE — Unfractionated heparin has an unpredictable dose response and a narrow therapeutic window; therefore, monitoring is essential to ensure optimal efficacy and safety, whereas body weight-adjusted doses of LMWH or fondaparinux can be administered subcutaneously without laboratory monitoring in the majority of these patients. UFH, not LMWH, can be affected by heparin resistance (including when the aPTT does not reflect the anti-Xa effect) and this may delay attainment of therapeutic levels; based on this, and to avoid risk of exposure for staff, we suggest that LMWH or fondaparinux be used over UFH in critically ill COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE. UFH might be preferred over LMWH or fondaparinux in patients at high bleeding risk (including those with severe renal failure [creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min]) or with overt or imminent hemodynamic decompensation due to PE, and patients with VTE in the setting of COVID-19 are considered to have a provoking factor, and thus initial treatment should be for at least 3 months.

### Anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis: caught between a rock-liver and a hard place [^116F6skU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current literature for anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis and provide a summary of the effects of cirrhosis on the coagulation cascade, therapeutic monitoring through interpretation of antifactor Xa (anti-Xa), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) as well as current prophylaxis and treatment recommendations in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

A systematic electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed using the key termsanticoagulation, warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin(LMWH), unfractionated heparin(UFH), target-specific oral anticoagulants, deep-vein thrombosis(DVT), pulmonary embolism(PE), portal vein thrombosis(PVT), venous thromboembolism, anti-Xa, activated partial thromboplastin time, anticoagulation therapeutic monitoring, coagulopathy, coagulation cascade, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, anddecompensated liver disease

Study Selection

Studies written in the English language from January 2000 to December 2015 were considered for this review article. All search results were reviewed, and the relevance of each article was determined by authors independently.

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for both bleeding and thrombosis-related complications. Cirrhosis affects production of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, thus resulting in increased INR and aPTT levels and decreased anti-Xa levels. LMWH is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of DVT/PE/PVT in patients with cirrhosis, and monitoring with anti-Xa levels for dose adjustment is not recommended. UFH is an alternative in cirrhotic patients for shorter-term use and in cases of severe renal dysfunction and/or hemodynamic instability. Cirrhotic patients on anticoagulation therapy should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding and thrombosis.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^1123AFc6]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins

LMWHs are derived from UFH through chemical or enzymatic depolymerisation, have approximately one third the molecular weight of UFH (Table 3), and have largely superseded UFH. LMWHs have reduced anti-IIa activity relative to anti-Xa activity because of their shorter molecular length (mean weight corresponds to ~15 saccharide units), a greater bioavailability and a longer duration of anticoagulant effect than UFH, permitting once/twice daily dosing. Although molecular and thus pharmacological heterogeneity still exists within and between LWMHs, it is less pronounced than for UFH, meaning LMWHs are routinely prescribed without monitoring. In VTE treatment, LMWH is used for both rapid anticoagulation during warfarinisation (LMWH therapy continuing until a stable therapeutic INR has been achieved), and when heparin-based anticoagulation is indicated for the duration of VTE treatment (e.g. in pregnancy). The dosing of LMWHs is mostly fixed for VTE thromboprophylaxis, but is weight-based for VTE treatment.

LMWH anti-Xa monitoring

Although LMWH therapy is generally unmonitored, monitoring has been suggested in specific clinical settings including adult patients receiving LMWH with concomitant renal dysfunction, morbid obesity, during pregnancy, and to check compliance. Consensus-based paediatric guidelines also recommend monitoring therapeutic LMWH in paediatric patients. The recommended monitoring test is the chromogenic anti-Xa assay, which indirectly determines drug concentration (in anti-Xa International Units/mL) by measuring ex vivo the extent to which exogenous factor Xa is inhibited by LMWH-antithrombin complexes present in the patient's blood sample. Clinical factors associated with anti-Xa activity on LMWH include dose, body weight, renal function (see later) and levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and TFPI-Xa complexes; the latter two being consistent with heparin-induced TFPI mobilisation.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes using activated partial thromboplastin time versus antifactor-Xa for monitoring therapeutic unfractionated heparin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YRuDX]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a mainstay of therapeutic anticoagulation in the acute setting. The two most common laboratory tests for monitoring UFH are the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) heparin assay. We reviewed the available evidence to evaluate if the choice of monitoring test for UFH therapy is associated with a difference in the clinical outcomes of bleeding, thrombosis, or mortality.

Materials and Methods

MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and conference abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Society of Hematology, and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy were searched for all studies comparing aPTT and anti-Xa monitoring for therapeutic UFH that evaluated outcomes for bleeding, thrombotic events, or mortality. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Pooled relative risk ratios were calculated using an inverse variance-weighted random-effects model.

Results

Ten studies (n = 6677) were included for analysis. The use of anti-Xa compared to aPTT was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.8–1.22 I² = 4%) or an increased risk of thrombotic events (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.76–1.30, I² = 3%). There was no difference in mortality within individual studies but the data were not suitable for pooled analysis.

Conclusions

Pooled data comparing aPTT vs. anti-Xa for monitoring therapeutic UFH did not suggest differences in the outcomes of bleeding or thrombosis.

Bivalirudin, also a direct thrombin inhibitor administered IV, has enzymatic elimination ("Enzymatic (25 min)"), is dosed by continuous infusion ("0.15 mg/kg/h"), and laboratory monitoring states "Adjust to aPTT 1.5–2.5 times baseline". Danaparoid, an indirect factor Xa inhibitor given IV with renal elimination ("Renal (24 h)"), guides dosing by "anti-Xa activity of 0.5–0.8 units/mL".

### Pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^115iv1JQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is based on antithrombotic therapy, initially with parenteral administration of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for five to seven days, then subsequent long-term therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Pentasaccharides are novel anticoagulants that may be favourable over standard therapy due to their predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a harmful effect of heparins, appears to be rare during treatment with pentasaccharides.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and harms of pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (22 March 2017) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2) (searched 22 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people 18 years of age or older with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, idraparinux, or idrabiotaparinux) for the treatment of DVT in comparison with standard therapy or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data characterising the included trials according to the methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and employed the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of the evidence. The main primary outcome for efficacy was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the main primary outcome for harm was major and clinically relevant bleeding. Since our outcomes were dichotomous, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined the effects of different comparisons through a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials of 6981 participants comparing pentasaccharides with standard therapy or other pentasaccharides. The quality of the evidence varied depending on the outcome and was judged as of moderate to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to risk of bias or imprecision, or both. Two studies evaluated fondaparinux, at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg, plus vitamin K antagonist in comparison with standard therapy. A meta-analysis of these two studies showed no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.47; 2658 participants); moderate-quality evidence. The frequencies of major bleeding were similar between interventions in the initial period of treatment (approximately five days) (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.44; 2645 participants) and at three months' follow-up (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; 2645 participants). We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate. One study (757 participants) compared idrabiotaparinux (3.0 mg) with idraparinux (2.5 mg) and demonstrated no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at six months' follow-up (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at six-month follow-up was less frequent in participants receiving idrabiotaparinux versus participants treated with idraparinux (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71); low-quality evidence. The effect of an initial treatment with LMWH followed by three months of idraparinux (10 mg) showed no clear difference from standard therapy for risk of recurrent VTE (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.90; 263 participants); very low-quality evidence; one study. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. The frequency of major and other clinically relevant bleeding at three months' follow-up ranged from 2% to 15% in participants receiving LMWH and increasing doses of idraparinux of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg. When dosage groups were combined, there was no clear difference in major plus other clinically relevant bleeding or in major bleeding alone between the idraparinux treatment group and the standard therapy group (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.40; 659 participants; RR 3.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.19; 659 participants, respectively); very low-quality evidence. One study (2904 participants) compared idraparinux (2.5 mg) to standard therapy. There was no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at three months' follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at three months of follow-up appeared to be similar in the idraparinux group and the standard therapy group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47); very low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that the effects of fondaparinux at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg plus vitamin K antagonist are similar in terms of recurrent VTE and risk of major bleeding compared with standard treatment for DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests equal efficacy of idraparinux at 2.5 mg and the equimolar dose of 3.0 mg of idrabiotaparinux with regard to recurrent VTE, but a higher frequency of major bleeding was observed in participants treated with idraparinux. We judged evidence on the effectiveness of idraparinux compared with standard therapy, with or without initial treatment with LMWH, and on associated bleeding risk to be low to very low quality, therefore we have very limited confidence in the estimated effects. The observed similar effectiveness in terms of recurrent DVT and harmful effects in terms of bleeding risk with fondaparinux plus vitamin K antagonist compared to standard treatment for DVT suggest that it may be an alternative to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of DVT in certain circumstances.

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^111mAF5b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^113PcAoY]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT — timing and selection: Prompt achievement and maintenance of fully therapeutic anticoagulation are essential for patients with acute iliofemoral DVT unless major contraindications exist (Level of Evidence A, Strength of Recommendation Strong), and consideration of ETR should not be permitted to delay the rapid achievement of fully therapeutic anticoagulation; weight-based, twice-daily, subcutaneously injected LMWH for most ETR candidates is suggested because it achieves therapeutic levels faster than intravenous UFH, enables consistent anticoagulation, and the safety of concomitantly using direct-acting oral anticoagulants with fibrinolytic drugs is uncertain; UFH is reasonable for periprocedural use provided therapeutic levels are reached quickly, active monitoring and timely dose adjustments are important, UFH may be maintained at fully therapeutic levels during on-table components and reduced to subtherapeutic levels during fibrinolytic drug infusions, and the patient's individualized risk of bleeding should be carefully considered when calibrating UFH levels.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^116x78d6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Frequent inpatient monitoring of serum coagulation parameters may be feasible for some LMIC facilities, but limited in many others. In situations where the costs of inpatient laboratory testing are passed to the patient or the family, these costs can quickly become prohibitive, so laboratory testing must be ordered judiciously.

The most common anticoagulant used in many LMIC settings for initial inpatient treatment is UFH. The major feasibility issue with UFH is the need for frequent blood draws to monitor activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) levels.

Limited laboratory capacity in some LMIC settings may preclude safe inpatient administration of continuous UFH infusion, although a fixed-dose weight and renal adjusted UFH protocol may be a safe alternative where LMWH is unavailable. Low molecular weight heparin requires no laboratory monitoring, but is typically more expensive for inpatients and may not be as readily available in some settings. Despite the high drug cost, studies from Europe and Brazil suggest that outpatient treatment of VTE with LMWH may save as much as US$1,641 per patient compared with inpatient UFH therapy. This cost saving analysis likely is irrelevant for the hospitalized COVID-19 patient given the low likelihood of outpatient therapy for this disease.

After the initial heparin-based therapy, the most common outpatient anticoagulant used in LMICs is warfarin. Warfarin is well studied, having been used for many years, and low cost generic versions are readily available throughout the world. The need for and costs associated with necessary laboratory monitoring of INR for warfarin patients, however, may be difficult in most resource-limited settings in LMICs. Even in facilities with relatively ample resources, appropriate treatment based on INR can be challenging.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, even in the absence of testing (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or DOACs for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight and renal function, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence)

How should COVID-19 patients on treatment for VTE be routinely monitored in LMICs?

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^114NwUKM]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography. In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months; the decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. Several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents are undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in patients with venous thromboembolism.

### Use of the activated partial thromboplastin time for heparin monitoring [^115M7J2U]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the relationship between heparin concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) results, define a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for each aPTT instrument, compare aPTT- and heparin concentration-guided dosage adjustment decisions, and compare laboratory- and bedside aPTT-guided decisions. In phase 1, 102 blood samples were analyzed for bedside and laboratory aPTTs and heparin concentration (used to establish aPTT therapeutic range). In phase 2, 100 samples were analyzed in the same manner. Correlations for aPTT compared with heparin ranged from 0.36 to 0.82. Dosage adjustment decisions guided by the aPTT agreed with those based on heparin concentration 63% to 80% of the time. Laboratory and bedside aPTT dosage adjustment decisions agreed 59% to 68% of the time. The correlation of aPTT with heparin concentration and agreement between aPTT- and heparin-guided decisions vary with the aPTT instrument. Decisions guided by laboratory aPTT results often disagree with decisions guided by bedside aPTT results.

### Correlation between thrombus regression and recurrent venous thromboembolism. examining venographic and clinical effects of low-molecular-weight heparins: a meta-analysis [^116ycpz1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

We analyzed the correlation between thrombus regression on control venography performed after discontinuation of heparin therapy and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during clinical follow-up in randomized trials comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Data were abstracted from MEDLINE, conference abstracts and reference lists of previous reviews. Randomized, controlled trials comparing LMWH and UFH for the treatment of DVT using a combined venographic and clinical assessment and with at least 2 months of follow-up were selected. The proportions of patients with thrombus regression on control venography performed soon after discontinuation of heparin therapy and recurrent VTE at 2–6 months were independently collected by two researchers. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a strong inverse correlation between thrombus regression and recurrent VTE (r = - 0.70; P = 0.008). The venographic effect varied between the different LMWHs (P = 0.013). A very strong correlation was found when the results were pooled by the type of LMWH used (r = - 0.84; P = 0.037). No influence of the dose interval used on the venographic effect (P = 0.156) or on recurrent VTE (P = 0.218) was shown. The lack of thrombus regression in venography, performed soon after heparin discontinuation, was correlated with clinical recurrence. Non-invasive imaging techniques should be relevant to identify non-responders and to assess the optimal duration of initial heparin treatment in daily clinical practice.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115tMygH]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcome estimation — strategy 3 (baseline risk from observational studies without surveillance, relative effect from RCT combined end points) begins with identifying observational studies of symptomatic VTE without venographic or ultrasound surveillance and then applying relative risk reductions from RCTs using the combined symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) end point. Advantages are that baseline risks come from real-world populations, are not subject to biases from treating asymptomatic events or misattributing symptoms after discovering venographic DVT, and can be reasonably precise with large samples; a key disadvantage is the persisting assumption that treatment effects are identical for symptomatic and asymptomatic events. The authors judge that the advantages outweigh disadvantages only if large observational studies have a low risk of bias and specify prophylaxis exposure, ideally reporting results separately for those receiving and not receiving prophylaxis; such studies are rarely available.

### Shorter hospital stays and lower costs for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for venous thrombosis admissions [^116Jdt1L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are manifestations of venous thromboembolic disease processes that result in serious and chronic comorbidities (eg, vascular insufficiencies, pulmonary hypertension) or death. 1 In the United States, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is estimated to occur in about 100 persons per 100 000 annually, with about two thirds of cases being DVT. 1, 2, 3 The economic and healthcare system burden of VTE is substantial, with estimated annual costs ranging from $13.5 to $27.2 billion (2011 US dollars). 4

Standard therapy for VTE is early treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, with the main goals of preventing extension and recurrence of the thrombotic event. 5 Acute DVT is more often treated at home than in the hospital, while acute PE is typically treated in the hospital since it is associated with much higher short‐term mortality. 5 Anticoagulation has traditionally been initiated with subcutaneous or intravenous heparin, either low‐molecular‐weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, given in combination with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), most commonly warfarin, started concurrently or shortly after initiating the heparin therapy. 5 VKAs have several clinical limitations. Warfarin is slow‐acting, with a narrow therapeutic range, unpredictable anticoagulant effects due to food and drug interactions, and highly variable metabolism. 6 Routine coagulation (laboratory) monitoring and dose adjustment are needed to maintain blood coagulation within the desired therapeutic window.

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events. The DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. The specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making. Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority in order to understand if we could do better through dose individualisation.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardised tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants of coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients (prolonged PT and aPTT, increased drug concentration in plasma). These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. Pros and Cons laboratory measurements are discussed.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^111FiaFd]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosing

There are no PK dose-finding studies reported for UFH in preterm or term neonates or children. A single-center case series (n = 25 neonates; gestational age range, 25–36 weeks) giving a bolus infusion of 100 U/kg and plasma heparin levels assayed at timed intervals to measure clearance showed that UFH clearance and volume of distribution was significantly higher in all neonatal groups (greater in preterm than term neonates) than in adults. In another study, which included infants (n = 15) on continuous UFH for VTE treatment, plasma heparin levels in the therapeutic range (0.35–0.7 IU/mL) and clinical resolution of the thrombi were associated with doses of 16 to 35 IU/kg per hour (mean, 27 IU/kg per hour), which is higher than in adults. Similarly, another single-institution prospective study of UFH therapy in 65 consecutive children with age-matched controls reported an average requirement of 28 IU/kg per hour for infants to maintain therapeutic aPTT.

A weight-based nomogram for heparin doses in pediatric patients has been previously published. Subsequently, the American College of Chest Physician guidelines suggested a higher bolus dose of 75 to 100 IU/kg based on unpublished data that resulted in therapeutic aPTT values in the majority of children. The maintenance dose required to prolong the aPTT to within the adult therapeutic range, corresponding to an anti-FXa level of 0.35 to 0.7 is higher in neonates compared with older children and is also gestational age dependent.

Both aPTT and anti-FXa levels are used in clinical practice to monitor UFH therapy. Multiple preanalytic, analytic, and clinical factors affect both aPTT and anti-FXa results. Studies have demonstrated a poor correlation between these tests when used to monitor UFH therapy, and lack of superiority in predicting thrombosis or bleeding. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians consistently use 1 test to monitor patients on UFH anticoagulation. Table 6 shows the suggested loading and initial age-based doses for UFH and monitoring.

2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium injection according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with heparin sodium injection by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection.

Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

### Treatment of PE… [^115G5JMS]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of DVT The goals of treatment for DVT are to stop clot propagation and prevent clot recurrence, PE, and pulmonary hypertension. These goals usually are achieved with anticoagulation using heparin followed by warfarin. Despite some controversy about the need to treat isolated calf-vein DVT, a recent evidence-based guideline on antithrombotic therapy recommends at least six to 12 weeks of anticoagulation. UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN Treatment with unfractionated heparin is based on body weight, and the dosage is titrated based on the APTT. An APTT of 1. 5 to
2. 3 times control is desirable. 6 Weight-based heparin dosing and adjustments based on the APTT are provided in Table 2. 6 This approach to heparin therapy has been shown to achieve adequate anticoagulation quickly and safely.

7 Heparin can be stopped after four or five days of combined therapy with warfarin if the International Normalized Ratio of prothrombin clotting time exceeds 2.
0.
8. LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN Compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin offers distinct advantages: it has a longer biologic half-life, it can be administered subcutaneously once or twice daily, dosing is fixed, and laboratory monitoring is not required. In addition, some adverse effects of unfractionated heparin, such as thrombocytopenia, appear to be less likely. In patients with DVT, subcutaneous administration of heparin is at least as effective as continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in preventing complications and reducing the risk of recurrence. Promising results have been shown for a protocol in which warfarin is initiated in a dosage of 10 mg per day.

16 In one study, 16 consecutive outpatients being treated with LMW heparin for DVT or PE were randomized to a 5-mg or 10-mg warfarin protocol. An INR higher than 1. 9 was achieved an average of

1. 4 days sooner in the patients who received warfarin according to the 10-mg protocol. Clot recurrence, bleeding events, and morbidity did not differ in the two treatment groups.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) monitoring — Therapeutic dosing is "usually monitored using the aPTT", and a retrospective study "suggested that an aPTT ratio between 1.5 and 2.5" led to wide acceptance of "a therapeutic aPTT range of 1.5 to 2.5 times control", yet assay responsiveness varies such that "aPTT results ranging from 48 to 108 s can be measured in samples with a heparin concentration of 0.3 units/mL", and with "heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 anti-Xa units/mL" aPTT ratios "range from 1.6–2.7 to 3.7–6.2 times control"; in the study establishing the range, an "aPTT ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 corresponded to a heparin level of 0.2 to 0.4 units" by protamine and "0.3 to 0.7 units" by anti-Xa, and interlaboratory studies "failed to show that correlating the aPTT with anti-Xa assays improves agreement"; for coronary indications the range "is unknown" but is "about 10% lower" than VTE treatment levels, and a randomized VTE trial showing unmonitored, weight‑adjusted high‑dose subcutaneous heparin twice daily was as safe and effective as unmonitored LMWH "challenge the requirement for aPTT monitoring of heparin administered subcutaneously".

### UNBLOCK: an open-label, dose-finding, pharmacokinetic and safety study of bivalirudin in children with deep vein thrombosis [^116eW9k2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Direct thrombin inhibitors offer potential advantages over unfractionated heparin but have been poorly studied in children.

Objectives

To determine appropriate dosing of bivalirudin in children and adolescents and the relationship between activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and plasma bivalirudin concentration.

Patients/Methods

The UNBLOCK (UtilizatioN of BivaLirudin On Clots in Kids) study was an open-label, single-arm, dose-finding, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study of bivalirudin for the acute treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in children aged 6 months to 18 years. Drug initiation consisted of a bolus dose (0.125 mg kg⁻¹) followed by continuous infusion (0.125 mg kg h⁻¹). Dose adjustments were based on the APTT, targeting a range of 1.5–2.5 times each patient's baseline APTT. Safety was assessed by specific bleeding endpoints and efficacy by repeat imaging at 48–72 h and 25–35 days.

Results

Eighteen patients completed the study. Following the bolus dose and the initial infusion rate, most patients' APTT values were within the target range. The infusion rate bivalirudin correlated more closely with drug concentration than the APTT. At 48–72 h, nine (50%) patients had complete or partial thrombus resolution, increasing to 16 (89%) at 25–35 days. No major and one minor bleeding event occurred.

Conclusions

Bivalirudin demonstrated reassuring safety and noteworthy efficacy in terms of early clot resolution in children and adolescents with DVT. Although a widely available and familiar monitoring tool, the APTT correlates poorly with plasma bivalirudin concentration, possibly limiting its utility in managing pediatric patients receiving bivalirudin for DVT.

### Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: current therapy [^117LhKW7]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the two most important manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular disease in the United States. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of VTE treatment. Most patients with deep venous thrombosis or low-risk pulmonary embolism can be treated in the outpatient setting with low-molecular-weight heparin and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Inpatient treatment of VTE begins with parenteral agents, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin. Unfractionated heparin is used if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or has severe renal insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are an alternative; however, concerns include cost and use of reversing agents (currently available only for dabigatran, although others are in development). If warfarin, dabigatran, or edoxaban is used, low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin must be administered concomitantly for at least five days and, in the case of warfarin, until the international normalized ratio becomes therapeutic for 24 hours. Hemodynamically unstable patients with a low bleeding risk may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. An inferior vena cava filter is not indicated for patients treated with anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of three months. Special situations, such as active cancer and pregnancy, require long-term use of low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation beyond three months should be individualized based on a risk/benefit analysis. Symptomatic distal deep venous thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation, but asymptomatic patients may be monitored with serial imaging for two weeks and treated only if there is extension.

### Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^117H93Ei]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Low-molecular-weight heparin is the preferred choice for the initial treatment of acute, uncomplicated venous thromboembolism. In this context, unfractionated heparin is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin but requires strict laboratory monitoring. Twice-daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is more effective than, and as safe as, intravenous unfractionated heparin and may simplify patient treatment in or out of the hospital, being possibly cost saving, especially if it is used in weight-based, fixed, unadjusted doses. The present review focuses on the relative values of low-molecular-weight heparin and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Recent Findings

The major advantages of low-molecular-weight heparin over unfractionated heparin seem to be ease of administration and cost savings associated with home therapy or early hospital discharge; however, many patients with venous thromboembolism are still admitted to the hospital for treatment, and unfractionated heparin is extensively used to this purpose, especially in the United States. Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time algorithms, is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, allows for quick mobilization and early discharge of suitable patients, and represents a cost-effective strategy. Fixed-dose unfractionated heparin, like low-molecular-weight heparin, may be used for the home treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Summary

Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, targeted on activated partial thromboplastin time results or in fixed doses, may be used in or out of the hospital for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, being possibly cost effective; however, these findings need confirmation through appropriate, large-sample, randomized clinical trials.

### Monitoring heparin anticoagulation in the acute phase response [^111ecd82]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). An APTT of 1.5–2.5 times the control is usually taken as the therapeutic range and assumed to reflect an anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) level of 0.35–0.7 u/ml. However, in some cases, despite administration of sufficient heparin to achieve a therapeutic anti-Xa assay level, the APTT remains sub-therapeutic. This 'apparent heparin resistance' is commonly due to high levels of factor VIII (FVIII). In these situations, the anti-Xa is usually preferred for monitoring in order to avoid, what might be, dangerously high levels of heparin. We hypothesized that at high FVIII levels, the heparin resistance encountered may be genuine rather than apparent and that higher doses of heparin may indeed be needed for an equivalent anticoagulant effect. The relationship between heparin level, APTT and anticoagulant effect at different FVIII concentrations was determined using thrombelastography and the thrombin generation assay. Thromboelastographic and thrombin generation parameters concurred with APTT, demonstrating a genuine heparin resistance in the presence of high FVIII levels. This suggests that APTT may be a more accurate measure of anticoagulant effect in vivo than anti-Xa.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa.

Subcutaneous LMWH and fixed dosed heparin require laboratory monitoring. For patients on therapeutic UFH, serial monitoring of (PTT; also known as APTT) or factor Xa is suggested. The benefit of monitoring IV heparin once a therapeutic threshold has been exceeded is not well defined.

Anticoagulation Forum and American College of Chest Physicians both recommend monitoring anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH because of baseline artefactual abnormalities in PTT and a potential for heparin resistance. None of the guidelines recommend dosing of LMWHs based on anti-Xa levels given lack of evidence on outcomes for thrombosis or bleeding. Body weight–adjusted doses for LMWH appear safer, which may be particularly effective in overweight patients. Elevated PT or PTT is not a contraindication to thromboprophylaxis in the absence of active bleeding. A platelet count < 25 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L constitutes a bleeding risk, warranting holding of standard dose VTE prophylaxis, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation should be withheld if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L.

The role of serial hemoglobin monitoring in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is poorly defined.

We found no data from LMICs regarding the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Speculative explanations for this finding include limited availability of laboratory assays for serological confirmation of HIT, expense associated with using nonheparin anticoagulants, and a lack of awareness of the guidelines.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

A study from Nigeria identified the inability to monitor as a primary reason for reduced clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines. In a separate multicenter survey from six southeastern Nigerian tertiary hospitals, most respondents were able to recognize PT and APTT, but not anti-Xa assay, as laboratory monitoring tools for anticoagulation therapy. This finding correlated with heparin and warfarin as the most commonly administered anticoagulants among respondents.

D -dimer testing might not be readily available in some LMICs and likely would incur a higher cost, although specific pricing in various LMIC environments remains unclear. Early COVID-19 studies suggest wide use of these tests in China, an upper middle-income country.

### Should we abandon the APTT for monitoring unfractionated heparin? [^112rypuu]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) but may not accurately measure the amount of heparin present. The anti-Xa assay is less susceptible to confounding factors and may be a better assay for this purpose.

Materials and Methods

The validity of the APTT for monitoring UFH was assessed by comparing with an anti-Xa assay on 3543 samples from 475 patients (infants [n = 165], children 1–15years [n = 60] and adults [n = 250]) receiving treatment dose UFH.

Results

Overall concordance was poor. The highest concordance (66%; 168/254) was seen in children. Concordance (51.8%) or discordance (48.4%) was almost equal in adult patients. Among adult patients whose anti-Xa level was within 0.3–0.7IU/mL, only 38% had an APTT in the therapeutic range whilst 56% were below and 6% were above therapeutic range. Children and adult patients with anti-Xa of 0.3–0.7IU/mL but sub- therapeutic APTT had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared to those with therapeutic or supra-therapeutic APTT.

Conclusions

When the anti-Xa level was 0.3–0.7IU/mL, the majority of samples from infants demonstrated a supra-therapeutic APTT, whilst adults tended to have a sub-therapeutic APTT. This may lead to under anticoagulation in infants or over anticoagulation in adults with risk of bleeding if APTT is used to monitor UFH. These results further strengthen existing evidence of the limitation of APTT in monitoring UFH. Discordance of APTT and anti-Xa level in adults and children may be due to elevation of fibrinogen level.

### The pharmacoeconomics of deep vein thrombosis treatment [^111W5Qca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, remains a common and costly condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment options for initial management of DVT include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), and fondaparinux, which is the first of a new class of pentasaccharide antithrombotic agents with anti-factor Xa activity. LMWHs are an important tool in DVT management, offering advantages over UFH such as ease of dosing, lack of need for coagulation monitoring, and reduced risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fondaparinux is also characterized by a simple dosing regimen, no need for coagulation monitoring, and potentially a lower risk of HIT compared with LMWH. In a recent clinical trial of DVT management, efficacy and bleeding rates with fondaparinux appeared similar to those observed with LMWH. In contrast to LMWH, fondaparinux is generally given as a fixed dose across a range of patient weights rather than calculated per individual patient weight. Given the increasing economic burden of VTE, particularly due to its increased rate among the elderly, pharmacoeconomic analyses have become a particularly useful tool to aid in selecting among similarly effective and safe agents for VTE treatment. A recent cost-effective analysis demonstrated that fondaparinux use offers an attractive economic alternative to other agents for initial DVT therapy that could yield cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes or patient safety.

TITLE Comparison of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with intravenous standard heparin in proximal deep-vein thrombosis.

AUTHORS Prandoni P, Lensing AW, Büller HR, et al.

JOURNAL The Lancet. 1992;339(8791):441–445. PMID: 1346817

Thirty years ago, The Lancet published the results of a randomized clinical trial comparing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the treatment of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The study was carried out at a single Italian center and enrolled a total of 170 patients over 5 years (from 1986 to 1991).

At that time, the standard treatment for DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) consisted of UFH, administered by a continuous intravenous infusion for approximately 10 days, followed by vitamin K antagonists. This treatment relied on laboratory measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio and on consequent dose adjustments. Not uncommonly, patients were hospitalized (and confined to bed) for 2 weeks or more.

In the 1980s, LMWH were developed and proposed as an alternative to UFH for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. LMWH offered, for the first time, the possibility of administering an anticoagulant drug at fixed doses, without the need for laboratory monitoring. However, the first studies comparing LMWH with UFH in the treatment of venous thrombosis still used the laboratory to determine the correct dose of LMWH and all studies published before the Italian trial used surrogate markers to assess therapeutic efficacy.

It was about time to test LMWH without laboratory support and to assess the occurrence of symptomatic events, recurrence or extension of DVT and bleeding, to reflect clinical practice. Needless to say, the idea of administering an anticoagulant drug to a patient with an extensive thrombosis and at potential risk of fatal PE without any information on treatment intensity from the laboratory was not as easy to accept as we may find it now.

Fondaparinux

Therapeutic range

Fondaparinux is not routinely monitored in adults but, if required, can be monitored using an anti-FXa activity assay, calibrated with fondaparinux. Target peak concentration for therapeutic anticoagulation in adults is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and this range has been extrapolated to children treated with fondaparinux. Fondaparinux does not usually affect routine coagulation tests, prothrombin time, or aPTT, when used in therapeutic doses but can cause aPTT prolongation at higher doses.

Dosing/dose frequency

A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years. This is based on an open-label prospective study (FondaKIDS) of 24 children treated for DVT or HIT. Dosing was adjusted to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours, tested initially after the first dose, with 88% of individuals achieving the target concentration without dose adjustment.

Periprocedural management

The anticoagulant effect of fondaparinux may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function because of its long elimination half-life.

Management of bleeding

There is no antidote to fondaparinux. Bleeding should be managed as per protocols for managing bleeding due to other irreversible anticoagulants.

Warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon

Therapeutic range

Target therapeutic ranges for children are currently extrapolated from the therapeutic ranges used in adults for the different indications. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children for the treatment of VTE is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). High-risk conditions may require a higher range of 2.5 to 3.5. As yet, there have been no clinical trials to assess appropriate INR ranges for children.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^1178gnny]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Advanced management of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: emergency department and beyond [^113TG353]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent attention to the increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism has included a call to action from the surgeon general and new guidelines from various specialty organizations. The standard of care for treatment of deep venous thrombosis in the emergency department (ED), supported by the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, involves initiation of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, pentasaccharide, or unfractionated heparin. For selected appropriate patients with extensive acute proximal deep venous thrombosis, the ACCP guidelines now recommend thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation to reduce not only the risk of pulmonary embolism but also the risk of subsequent postthrombotic syndrome and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Postthrombotic syndrome is a potentially debilitating chronic cluster of lower-extremity symptoms occurring in 20% to 50% of deep venous thrombosis patients subsequent to the acute insult, sometimes not until years later. A strategy of early thrombus burden reduction or frank removal might reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome, as per natural history studies, venous thrombectomy data, observations after systemic and catheter-directed thrombolysis, and the still-limited number of randomized trials of catheter-directed thrombolysis (with anticoagulation) versus anticoagulation alone. Contemporary invasive (endovascular) treatments mitigate the drawbacks historically associated with thrombolytic approaches by means of intrathrombus delivery of drugs with greater fibrin specificity and lower allergenicity, followed by mechanical dispersion to accelerate lysis and then aspiration of remaining drug and clot debris. With a 2016 target completion date, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute — sponsored Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis trial is comparing the safety and efficacy, in terms of both deep venous thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome parameters, of the most evolved pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis devices versus standard anticoagulation therapy alone. This article reviews the grounds for use of adjunctive thrombolysis in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis and begins to identify types of deep venous thrombosis patients encountered in the ED who might benefit most from multidisciplinary consideration of early referral for possible endovascular therapy.

### Plasma anti-FXa level as a surrogate marker of the adequacy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^1158hSM4]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critical care patients are prone to venous thromboembolism (VTE) and, thus, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is generally advised. Low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have become the drug of choice in ICU patients, since their predictable and reproducible dose response. Monitoring their pharmacological effect is not usually necessary except in special occasions (i.e. with obese or renal failure patients), where anti-FXa level measuring is recommended. However, there is neither recommendation of adequate anti-FXa levels in critically ill patients nor is it known whether peak or trough level should be measured. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the recommended LMWH doses, and the reasons to monitor anti-FXa levels.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.com to identify all potentially relevant studies. Prospective studies done in critically ill patients were included if at least one anti-FXa level (i.e. peak or trough) after any specified LMWH thromboprophylaxis dose was measured.

Results

Total 18 eligible studies including 1644 patients were included. There was a wide variation in the median peak anti-FXa levels (< 0.1–0.35IU/ml). Trough levels were generally low. Of note, none of the studies detected any correlation with bleeding events and anti-FXa levels. Low trough level increased incidence of DVT in one study only.

Conclusion

Based on the current literature, no definite conclusions can be drawn on targeted anti-FXa level in critically ill patients when using LMWH thromboprophylaxis.

### A novel long-acting synthetic factor Xa inhibitor (sanOrg34006) to replace warfarin for secondary prevention in deep vein thrombosis. A phase II evaluation [^114boNCd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists for secondary prevention in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) require monitoring and dose adjustments. The synthetic factor Xa inhibitor, SanOrg34006, has predictable pharmacokinetics and may be administered once weekly without dose adjustments.

Methods

After 5–7 days of enoxaparin treatment, patients with proximal DVT were randomized to receive 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 or 10 mg of SanOrg34006 subcutaneously once weekly or warfarin (INR, 2.0–3.0) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of change in thrombotic burden, as assessed by ultrasonography and perfusion lung scanning at baseline and week 12 ± 1, and clinical thromboembolic events. This outcome was classified as normalization, no relevant change, or deterioration. Other outcomes were major and other clinically relevant bleeding.

Results

A total of 659 patients were randomized and treated. In 614 (93%) patients the primary efficacy outcome was evaluable. The rates of normalization and deterioration were similar in all SanOrg34006 groups (P = 0.4) and did not differ from the warfarin group. There was a clear dose-response for major bleeding among patients treated with SanOrg34006 (P = 0.003). Patients receiving 2.5 mg SanOrg34006 had less bleeding than did warfarin recipients (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

SanOrg34006 dosed at 2.5 mg appears as effective as higher dosages and warfarin for secondary prevention in DVT and was not associated with major bleeding. Therefore, 2.5 mg of SanOrg34006 administered subcutaneously once weekly might be a suitable alternative to dose-adjusted oral vitamin K antagonist.

### Fondaparinux sodium [^116KhoMF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of fondaparinux sodium. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. Discontinue fondaparinux sodium if the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 3% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 0.2% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in these clinical trials. During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported.

Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.

Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.6 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests

Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of fondaparinux sodium and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium. If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with fondaparinux sodium, discontinue fondaparinux sodium. In postmarketing experience, occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with fondaparinux sodium.

The anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux). The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

Quality review and follow-up practices are outlined: when the observed rate of early treatment success prompts an internal quality review, we suggest attention to the following items, including ensuring intrathrombus drug delivery was accomplished because systemic thrombolysis and flow-directed thrombolysis are not as effective as intrathrombus CDT and confirming therapeutic-level anticoagulation was provided during procedural manipulations and after procedure completion with heparin-based therapy given during the infusion CDT component; when the observed rate of recurrent thrombosis prompts review, it should be confirmed that patients received careful monitoring of anticoagulation during the initial weeks and that long-term anticoagulant therapy matched individualized recurrence risk; in general, patients with provoked DVT due to a major reversible risk factor should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulant therapy.

American Society of Hematology guidelines — pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) key points: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complicates ∼1.2 of every 1000 deliveries, and the panel agreed on 31 recommendations spanning treatment of VTE and superficial vein thrombosis, diagnosis of VTE, and thrombosis prophylaxis. The guideline states a strong recommendation for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin for acute VTE. Most recommendations were conditional, including those for either twice-per-day or once-per-day LMWH dosing for the treatment of acute VTE and initial outpatient therapy over hospital admission with low-risk acute VTE, as well as against routine anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring to guide dosing with LMWH for VTE treatment. The panel also made a strong recommendation (low certainty in evidence) for antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with a history of unprovoked or hormonally associated VTE and a conditional recommendation against antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with prior VTE associated with a resolved nonhormonal provoking risk factor.

14.4 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5,000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of once-daily dose of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal lower limb deep-vein thrombosis [^111MyZoB]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin, rather than a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is more convenient and allows for home care in some patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens for the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT.

Methods

201 patients with proximal lower limb DVT from 13 centers in Brazil were randomized in an open manner to receive either enoxaparin [1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) OD] or intravenous (i.v.) UFH (adjusted to aPTT 1.5–2.5 times control) for 5–10 days. All patients also received warfarin (INR 2–3) for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent DVT (confirmed by venography or ultrasonography), and safety endpoints included bleeding and serious adverse events. The rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) was also collected. Hospitalization was at the physician's discretion.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between groups. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH (3 versus 7 days). In addition, 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, whereas all of the patients receiving UFH were hospitalized. The treatment duration was slightly longer with enoxaparin (8 versus 7 days). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of recurrent DVT with enoxaparin versus UFH, and similar safety.

Conclusions

A once-daily regimen of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous is at least as effective and safe as conventional treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Fixed-dose versus adjusted-dose low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of patients with deep venous thrombosis [^116reXdA]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were treated with a body-weight independent dosage of 2 x 8000 aXa IU low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Certoparin. After the subcutaneous administration of 8000 IU Certoparin, pharmacodynamic parameters did not differ between patients and healthy volunteers, and the AUC of the anticoagulant effects were not related to body weight. Two clinical trials demonstrated a greater regression of thrombi and a lower occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and mortality within 14 days of initial therapy compared with intravenous heparin. D-dimer decreased, and anti-Xa activity increased in those patients with a regression of thrombosis. The benefit of the reduced occurrence of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality was maintained up to 6 months. Major bleeding was not related to the body weight in either treatment group. Treatment of acute DVT in adults with fixed dose of 2 x 8000 aXa IU LMWH Certoparin is more effective and safer than heparin.

Heparin monitoring and bleeding risk — The risk of heparin-associated bleeding increases with heparin dose and with concomitant administration of fibrinolytic agents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and it is also increased by recent surgery, trauma, invasive procedures, or concomitant hemostatic defects; in hospitalized patients, increasing number of comorbidities, age ≥ 60 y, supratherapeutic clotting times, and worsening hepatic dysfunction increase the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding. Because the anticoagulant response to heparin varies among patients, it is standard practice to monitor heparin and to adjust the dose based on the results of coagulation tests. The evidence for adjusting the dose of heparin to maintain a "therapeutic range" is weak, whereas the evidence for maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) within a "therapeutic range" in vitamin K antagonist therapy is strong.

### Cost-minimization analysis of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) compared to unfractionated heparin for inpatient treatment of cancer patients with deep venous thrombosis [^114kf63R]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has shown to be as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Although the acquisition cost of LMWH is significantly greater than that of UFH, we hypothesized that once-daily dalteparin, a LMWH, could reduce treatment costs of cancer patients with DVT by eliminating anticoagulation monitoring and shortening hospitalization.

Patients and Methods

We developed a cost-minimization model by using outcomes and resource utilization data from two retrospective matched cohorts of cancer patients who, between 1994 and 1999, were hospitalized at our comprehensive cancer center for treatment of DVT with either LMWH (n = 21) or UFH (n = 168). We assumed all LMWHs and UFH to be equally effective. The total costs for the dalteparin strategy and the UFH strategy were calculated in year 2003 U.S. dollars, from the provider's perspective, by multiplying the number of resources used for inpatient treatment of DVT by their unit costs.

Results

The mean total cost for inpatient care was $3,383 US dollars (95% CI = $2,683- $4,083) for dalteparin and $4,952 US dollars (95% CI = $4,718-$5,185) for UFH. Substantial savings resulted from shorter hospitalization among the dalteparin-treated patients (mean 3.19 versus 5.22 days). Sensitivity analysis did not change the conclusion that dalteparin is less expensive than UFH.

Conclusions

Savings realized from less anticoagulant monitoring and shorter hospitalization offset the higher acquisition cost of dalteparin. The dalteparin strategy is less expensive than the UFH strategy for the inpatient treatment of DVT among cancer patients.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^111dC8Wg]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) — therapeutic range and monitoring in children: The therapeutic range used in pediatrics is largely extrapolated from adults, recommending an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that reflects "a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti–FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL", noting that this "has yet to be confirmed by RCTs". Foundational adult data linked recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk to failure to achieve "an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value" with correlation to "0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration". For monitoring in children, "UFH monitoring using the aPTT titrated to an anti-FXa assay result of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, is associated with significant age-related variation", and "Infants and children can have significantly higher aPTT compared with adult reference ranges". The guideline notes that "Most laboratories do not adjust aPTT therapeutic ranges based on age", and that "pediatric studies report a poor correlation between aPTT and anti-FXa activity", with "some pediatric institutions" using anti-FXa monitoring for UFH.

Antifactor Xa monitoring and associated dose adjustments

What is the utility of antifactor Xa monitoring for VTE chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

A regimen for VTE prophylaxis using enoxaparin with dose adjustment based on anti-Xa levels may be considered for trauma and surgical ICU patients thought to have a low bleeding risk. Such a regimen results in more patients having anti-Xa levels in the target range than with a fixed dosing regimen. However, evidence is insufficient to determine if this practice results in lower VTE rates. This strategy may not be appropriate for some patients (eg, those with TBI) and individual patient characteristics should be considered when choosing a dosing regimen.

Discussion

The study by Geerts et al in 1996showed benefit of enoxaparin 30 mg twice a day in reducing venogram-diagnosed DVT rates, and minimal reduction with UFH (5000 units twice a day) in trauma. More recent evidence, mostly from underpowered retrospective studies, has suggested that the typical fixed dosing regimen of enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day does not inhibit factor Xa in a uniform and predictable manner in all patients. This makes intuitive sense, given the variable degree of VTE risk, hypercoagulability and sometimes unpredictable pharmacokinetics in critically ill and injured patients.

Anti-Xa activity is assessed via a functional assay that measures the degree of inhibition of factor Xa by UFH or LMWH. Blood for anti-Xa testing is typically drawn 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparin. Levels are measured in International Units per milliliter, with target prophylactic levels falling in the range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL (the target for therapeutic full anticoagulation is > 0.5 IU/mL). If levels are below target, the dose may be increase by 10 mg and levels rechecked again 4 hours after the third new dose. Data on the maximum safe dose are insufficient, but several authors have recommended not exceeding 60 mg two times per day dosing. While true therapeutic dosing often exceeds 60 mg two times per day, the conditions under which clinicians may provide prophylactic enoxaparin may differ from those for therapeutic, especially when considering bleeding risk. Also, if anti-Xa levels have not reached prophylactic targets at higher doses, one should consider heparin resistance or antithrombin-III deficiency, occult VTE with high clot burden or other undetected factors that may prompt further investigation.

### Medical management of venous thromboembolic disease [^1121k7o4]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) are common disorders with serious morbid and mortal complications. Given the varied modes of presentation, a high clinical index of suspicion in patients at risk must exist among physicians. Standard therapy has consisted of intravenous unfractionated heparin and overlapping administration of an oral Vitamin K antagonist, commonly Warfarin. Although an effective strategy, many practical limitations exist, including the need for prolonged hospitalization, frequent laboratory monitoring for anticoagulant effect, and erratic dose-response curves. Recently, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparins have emerged as safe and effective alternatives for unfractionated heparin. Appropriate patients may be treated with low-molecular-weight heparins and oral Warfarin entirely as outpatients, with similar efficacy and risk of recurrent thromboembolic events and hemorrhage. Thrombolytic therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with iliofemoral venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism resulting in hemodynamic compromise or obstructing significant pulmonary vasculature. Risks of serious hemorrhagic side effects including intracranial hemorrhage, along with the added economic burden, have limited widespread acceptance of thrombolytic therapy as primary treatment. Emerging oral direct thrombin inhibitors and other novel agents stand to move the treatment of patients with venous thromboemboli to even greater levels of safety and efficacy.

### How we changed our approach to venous thromboembolism [^113raZBL]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

In the study published in The Lancet, 85 patients received intravenous UFH with a target aPTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the pretreatment value and 85 patients received twice daily fixed, weight-adjusted doses of the LMWH nadroparin. Warfarin was started after 7 days of heparin treatment and heparins were discontinued on day 10, or later if the INR was still below 2.0. After a 6-month follow-up, 12 recurrent thrombotic events had occurred in the group treated with UFH and six in the LMWH group; four and one of these events, respectively, were diagnosed during parenteral treatment. As shown in Figure 1, three recurrent events in each group were fatal PE, but only one (in a patient on LMWH) occurred during parenteral treatment. Bleeding events defined as severe occurred in three patients receiving UFH (all retroperitoneal bleeds) and in one patient receiving LMWH (hematemesis). The study was not sufficiently powered to show statistically significant differences between groups, but LMWH clearly appeared to be at least as effective and safe as UFH and the authors hypothesized future changes in the management of venous thrombosis. These changes included the possibility of allow ing patients to be fully ambulant thanks to the subcutaneous administration of LMWH and the possibility of outpatient management thanks to the fact that laboratory monitoring was not needed.

These hypotheses were confirmed a few years later by two randomized studies that demonstrated that subcutaneous LMWH administered out of hospital without laboratory monitoring is as effective and safe as continuous infusion of UFH given in hospital. Following the results of these studies, in a few years the management of venous thrombosis changed dramatically, with more than 90% of patients with DVT and selected patients with low-risk PE being treated out of hospital. These changes clearly improved the quality of life of patients with venous thrombosis and resulted in lower costs of management.

More than 10 years later, LMWH also became the standard treatment for cancer-associated venous thrombosis, as a single-drug approach, and more than 20 years later direct oral anticoagulants are further contributing to simplify the management of venous thrombosis.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111yXEGR]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Rivaroxaban — monitoring anticoagulant intensity — The predictable pharmacologic profile of rivaroxaban allows administration at fixed doses without the need for routine laboratory monitoring or dose adjustments, though there may be rare situations (overdose, unexpected bleeding, compliance assessment, drug interactions, or drug accumulation in renal or hepatic impairment) when a quantitative clotting assay might be valuable; however, there are currently no validated laboratory assays that can be recommended to monitor rivaroxaban or any recommendations for dose adjustments based on observed test results. Thromboplastins used for prothrombin time (PT) assays have differing sensitivities to factor Xa inhibitors, the INR does not adequately correct for these differences, and PT ratios measured after adding rivaroxaban 1 µg/mL to plasma varied from 2.25 to 7.32 with different thromboplastins; in assay evaluations, there was a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the effect on the aPTT was weaker than on the PT, and rivaroxaban also prolonged thromboelastograph parameters. Neither the PT (expressed either in seconds or as a ratio) nor the aPTT should be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban.
