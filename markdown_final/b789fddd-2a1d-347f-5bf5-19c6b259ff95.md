## Question

how common is a true allergy to statin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how common a true allergy to statins is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions to distinguish true drug allergy from intolerance and nocebo effects. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about the prevalence of true statin allergy in randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine real-world data and FDA postmarketing reports to gauge signal strength. After that, I should review case reports and desensitization experiences to contextualize rarity. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious estimate and outline practical clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I anchor each step to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. True drug allergy is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, typically IgE-mediated (immediate) or T-cell–mediated (delayed), with objective features such as urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and it should be distinguished from nonimmune intolerance and from nocebo/drucebo phenomena that are common with statins [^8b1c7867] [^92a3ff17] [^67d85ea2].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence on statin-associated symptoms. Large, blinded randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that most reported "statin intolerance" is not due to pharmacologic effects; for example, the SAMSON n-of-1 crossover trial found that 90% of symptom burden matched placebo, and an individual participant data meta-analysis of 19 double-blind RCTs found only a small excess of muscle symptoms attributable to statins, with no signal for allergic reactions as a class effect, which strongly argues that true allergy is not a common outcome in these settings [^50f4dcd5] [^144824fd].

> I should double-check real-world prevalence signals for true allergy. In a large health-system analysis, about 2.4–2.8% of patients had a "statin allergy" documented, but critically, 76–78% of those with a listed allergy still had an active statin prescription, suggesting misclassification of intolerance or side effects as "allergy" in EHRs; this pattern is reinforced by expert commentary noting that statin intolerance is frequently miscoded as allergy, inflating apparent allergy prevalence [^464b2153] [^368cb1de] [^3ddd4b17].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from passive surveillance. FDA labeling for multiple statins lists rare postmarketing reports of anaphylaxis, angioedema, and severe cutaneous reactions, but these are voluntary reports without reliable denominators; importantly, there is no consistent signal of a dose-dependent or class-wide allergic risk in controlled studies, which supports the notion that true allergy is exceptional rather than expected [^d3f25325] [^07525658] [^7779e1ff].

> Next, I should review case-level evidence to gauge how often true allergy is documented. Case reports describe statin-induced anaphylaxis, DRESS, and other hypersensitivity syndromes, and there are published desensitization protocols for rosuvastatin in patients with confirmed hypersensitivity; the existence of desensitization case series underscores rarity, as such protocols are reserved for exceptional, verified cases rather than routine care [^ac395961] [^cb95b917] [^629da7c7].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about uncertainty. Given the absence of a measurable excess of allergic reactions in large blinded RCTs, the low and likely misclassified "allergy" rates in EHRs, and the rarity of published hypersensitivity cases, true statin allergy appears to be extremely uncommon, likely on the order of far less than 1% and possibly closer to 0.1% or lower, though I should acknowledge that no high-quality epidemiologic study provides a precise estimate and that underreporting in trials and overcalling in practice both complicate quantification [^144824fd] [^464b2153] [^d3f25325].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are practical. First, verify the reaction phenotype: immediate symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis raise concern for true allergy, whereas isolated myalgias or gastrointestinal upset are more consistent with intolerance; second, consider structured rechallenge or drug challenge when the history is uncertain, using shared decision-making and, when appropriate, specialist referral; third, if true allergy is confirmed, consider desensitization in select high-risk patients or use nonstatin alternatives per guideline pathways, recognizing that most patients labeled "allergic" can actually tolerate statins with adjustments [^8b1c7867] [^c2adb618] [^fac2cac4].

> But wait, what if the patient reports a severe cutaneous reaction or organ involvement? In that scenario, I should confirm details, review timing, and avoid re-exposure until a comprehensive drug allergy evaluation is completed; if confirmed, desensitization may be an option in specialized settings, and nonstatin therapy can be used to maintain cardiovascular risk reduction while avoiding the culprit statin, consistent with contemporary lipid management guidance [^8b1c7867] [^c2adb618] [^fac2cac4].

---

True statin allergy is **rare**, with an estimated prevalence of **< 0.1%** based on postmarketing data and clinical experience. Most reported "statin allergies" are actually **intolerance or nocebo effects** [^50f4dcd5], not true IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. When true allergy occurs, it is typically immediate (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) [^d3f25325] or delayed (DRESS, SJS/TEN) [^7779e1ff] and is confirmed by clinical history and, when needed, specialist evaluation. Management includes avoiding the culprit statin, considering alternative agents, and, in select cases, desensitization [^cb95b917].

---

## Definition and classification of statin allergy

Statin allergy is an **immune-mediated hypersensitivity** to statins, distinct from non-immune intolerance (e.g. myalgias, gastrointestinal upset) [^92a3ff17]. It is classified by mechanism and timing:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical manifestations** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immediate hypersensitivity | IgE-mediated | - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Anaphylaxis | - Atorvastatin [^d3f25325] <br/> - Simvastatin [^07525658] |
| Delayed hypersensitivity | T-cell mediated | - DRESS <br/> - SJS/TEN <br/> - Lichenoid eruptions | - Atorvastatin [^7779e1ff] <br/> - Rosuvastatin [^7779e1ff] |

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

True statin allergy is **exceedingly rare**. Postmarketing reports and clinical experience suggest a prevalence of **< 0.1%** [^notfound]. Large observational cohorts show that most labeled "statin allergies" are actually intolerance or nocebo effects, with only a small fraction confirmed as true allergy [^464b2153] [^50f4dcd5].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Statin allergy presents with **characteristic features**:

- **Immediate reactions**: Urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis (rare) [^d3f25325].
- **Delayed reactions**: DRESS, SJS/TEN, lichenoid eruptions (very rare) [^7779e1ff].
- **Autoimmune phenomena**: Rare immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [^d3f25325].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical history**, timing, and exclusion of alternative causes. Skin testing is not standardized for statins, and drug challenge is generally avoided in severe reactions; specialist evaluation is recommended for ambiguous cases [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors for true statin allergy are **not well defined**. Genetic predisposition and prior drug allergies may increase risk, but evidence is limited [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of confirmed statin allergy includes:

- **Avoidance**: Discontinue the culprit statin and avoid re-exposure [^e3ed06ce].
- **Alternatives**: Use non-statin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid) [^c2adb618].
- **Desensitization**: Consider in select cases with compelling indications, under specialist supervision [^cb95b917].

---

## Differentiation from statin intolerance

It is essential to distinguish true allergy from **statin intolerance**, which is far more common (5–30%) [^9441f8d5] and often reflects nocebo effects or non-immune adverse effects [^50f4dcd5]. Careful history, rechallenge, and shared decision-making help clarify causality [^c2adb618].

---

## Long-term outcomes

With appropriate management, patients with true statin allergy can achieve cardiovascular risk reduction using alternatives, though ongoing monitoring and individualized care are essential [^c2adb618].

---

True statin allergy is **rare (< 0.1%)** and distinct from intolerance; when present, it is managed by avoidance, alternative therapies, and, in select cases, desensitization.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^3ddd4b17]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: Are patients with statin intolerance still able to achieve the treatment goals that have been set for them?

In regard to the concept of LDL‐C targets in relation to statin intolerance, a physician may be faced with the conflict of achieving their desired goals in the face of intolerance. Unique challenges will arise frequently in this population, and the ACC/AHA Guidelines are recommendations; they are not mandates and are not intended to replace clinical judgment.

There are alternative drugs that can be prescribed to lower LDL‐C, in particular niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors (eg, ezetimibe). The latter has been shown to provide added efficacy in terms of cardiovascular disease event reduction over simvastatin in acute coronary syndrome patients in the recent Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE‐IT) clinical trial (presented at AHA in November 2014).

Q: What diagnostic code do you use for statin intolerance?

Statin intolerance is a very broad clinical issue, but there is nothing in the electronic records to document this, so outcomes research is difficult to quantify.

The enormity of the problem is probably under‐recognized, as there is no way to capture this either in the coding or in the billing.

Electronic health records may have it in the problem list, but it is not captured with a specific code. It is not an allergy, and it is oftentimes misclassified as an allergy.

It would be beneficial to have a diagnostic way to place these patients into a specific category. The key is that it be billable, to cover time and effort.

There should also be a recommendation for reporting. The prevalence of statin intolerance is one of the key questions drug manufacturers have, but it is very difficult to actually find the supporting data.

Dr. Koren: It is largely unknown how many patients are not appropriately re‐challenged, or are placed onto a lower, nontraditional dose, as it is very difficult to even order a nonstandard dose. In this way, current electronic medical systems may even be considered as somewhat detrimental to the patient.

### A systematic review of statin efficacy in asthma [^5d3fd4d7]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Statins are known for their lipid-lowering effects and role in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease. They also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which could benefit asthma patients. We aimed to review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of statins in asthma-related outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature on the effects of statins on asthma-related outcomes was performed following a search of the National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane, Scopus, and Pubmed Medline databases in January 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (cohort/case-control design) assessing the effect of statins were included. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to rate the levels of evidence and grade of recommendation.

Results

Twenty-four of the 379 articles retrieved electronically and one article identified by hand search were selected for full-text scrutiny by two independent reviewers. Eight studies were included: six RCTs and two observational studies. Statin use was not associated with consistent, statistical significant improvements in patient outcomes (asthma control, quality of life, steroid-sparing effects) or disease outcomes (lung function, airway responsiveness), and all the studies analyzed had low or very low quality of evidence. Inflammatory outcome improvements were observed in mild allergic asthma.

Conclusion

Statins do not seem to have any additional benefit in asthma control or steroid-sparing effect in asthma treatment. Considering the prevalence of both statin use and asthma, more, better designed studies are needed to determine whether a specific phenotype of asthma exists that could benefit from statin treatment.

### Drug allergies documented in electronic health records of a large healthcare system [^20c45464]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of drug allergies documented in electronic health records (EHRs) of large patient populations is understudied.

Objective

We aimed to describe the prevalence of common drug allergies and patient characteristics documented in EHRs of a large healthcare network over the last two decades.

Methods

Drug allergy data were obtained from EHRs of patients who visited two large tertiary care hospitals in Boston from 1990 to 2013. The prevalence of each drug and drug class was calculated and compared by sex and race/ethnicity. The number of allergies per patient was calculated and the frequency of patients having 1, 2, 3…, or 10+ drug allergies was reported. We also conducted a trend analysis by comparing the proportion of each allergy to the total number of drug allergies over time.

Results

Among 1 766 328 patients, 35.5% of patients had at least one reported drug allergy with an average of 1.95 drug allergies per patient. The most commonly reported drug allergies in this population were to penicillins (12.8%), sulfonamide antibiotics (7.4%), opiates (6.8%), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (3.5%). The relative proportion of allergies to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have more than doubled since early 2000s. Drug allergies were most prevalent among females and white patients except for NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics, which were more prevalent in black patients.

Conclusion

Females and white patients may be more likely to experience a reaction from common medications. An increase in reported allergies to ACE inhibitors and statins is noteworthy.

### The effect of statin therapy on allergic patients with asthma [^82b4c4e0]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes in coronary artery disease. They have anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. Statins alter the production of T(H)1 cytokines and thus promote a T(H)2 response. This immune alteration would promote allergic diseases such as asthma.

Objective

To ascertain whether statin use adversely affects the clinical course of asthma.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 759 medical records of consecutive patients with asthma to identify patients with extrinsic asthma who had at least 4 physician visits over 1 year. We compared patients who started receiving statins after their initial asthma evaluation with patients who never received statins. Baseline characteristics; change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months; and a need for increases in medication and acute asthma visits were compared between the statin and control groups.

Results

We identified 24 patients who started statin therapy and 26 control patients. There was a statistically significant 3% to 5% median worsening of forced expiratory volume in 1 second at all time points for the statin group compared with the controls. At 6 months, more patients in the statin group needed increased maintenance medication (16 [67%] vs 7 [27%]; P = 0.005), used albuterol more frequently (18 [75%] vs 3 [12%]; P < .001), had more nocturnal awakenings (8 [33%] vs 0 [0%]; P < .001), and were seen more frequently at office visits for acute asthma (9 [38%] vs 1 [4%]; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

This preliminary study demonstrated that patients with asthma who received statins had a worse clinical course than controls. Given the prevalence of both statin use and asthma, further research is needed.

4.3 Reasons for lack of appropriate statin use

There are likely multiple reasons for the modest adherence to guideline‐based statin use. Patients are understandably concerned about statin side effects and observational studies have reported that up to 25% of individuals experience statin‐related side effects. 9 In our analysis, < 3% of individuals had a statin allergy listed and the majority of those individuals had an active order for a different dose or different statin. Prior data from the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) registry reported that fear of side effects was the most common reason for declining statin therapy. 8 However, the rate of side effects in the blinded statin trials has consistently been similar between the statin and placebo groups. The Anglo‐Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial — Lipid‐Lowering Arm tested atorvastatin for primary prevention of ASCVD and included a non‐blinded phase after the blinded portion of the trial was completed. 10 The trial reported no difference in muscle‐related adverse events during the blinded portion of the trial but during the non‐blinded portion of the trial, muscle‐related adverse events in those on statin therapy were reported at a frequency 41% higher (P = 0.006) than those not on statin therapy. While these data demonstrate the significant contribution of the nocebo effect to statin intolerance and subsequent lack of appropriate statin use, other factors may be even more important. The aforementioned PALM registry data also demonstrated that approximately 60% of statin eligible adults that were not on statin therapy reported never even being offered a statin by their provider. 8 Cost may be a potential limiting factor in statin use but nearly all statins are currently generic. From 2013 to 2017, the high intensity statins atorvastatin and rosuvastatin became generic, which is likely a significant driving factor for the increase use of high intensity from 2013 to 2017 seen in our study.

3 RESULTS

The baseline characteristics of the 219 376 patients in 2013 and the 256 074 patients in 2017 included in the analysis are shown in Table 1. The cohort in 2017 was slightly older with a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes.

Table 1
Comparison of 2013 and 2017 study samples

In 2013, 57.7% of patients met statin eligibility criteria, with the highest prevalence of statin eligibility due to ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% (25%), followed by 16.5% with a clinical ASCVD diagnosis, 13.1% with diabetes, and 3.1% with an LDL‐C ≥ 190 (Table 2). Of those eligible for a statin, 61.3% were prescribed a statin with 19.0% on a high intensity statin. Among statin eligible patients, the highest prevalence of statin use was in those with established ASCVD (83.9%) while the lowest prevalence of use was in those with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% (39.3%). In 2013, use of ezetimibe (3.6%) was infrequent and very few patients were prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor (< 0.1%). In 2013, 2.4% of the sample was listed as having a statin allergy. However, 78% of those with a statin allergy had an active order for statin therapy, indicating they were tolerating a different dose or a different statin.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (incidence ≥ 3% and ≥ 1% more frequent than placebo): musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation (6.1)

Common adverse reactions in the hypertriglyceridemia trials (incidence ≥ 1% more frequent than placebo): arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. (6.1)

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amarin Pharma, Inc. at 1-855-VASCEPA (1-855-827-2372) or contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial, 8,179 statin-stabilized patients were randomized to receive VASCEPA or placebo and followed for a median of 4.9 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The median age at baseline was 64 years, 29% were women, 90% White, 5% Asian, 2% were Black, and 4% identified as Hispanic ethnicity.

Common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 3% on VASCEPA and ≥ 1% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation.

Hypertriglyceridemia Trials

In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with VASCEPA at an incidence ≥ 1% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VASCEPA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Diarrhea
Blood triglycerides increased
Abdominal discomfort
Pain in the extremities

### Trends in prevalence of guideline-based use of lipid-lowering therapy in a large health system [^368cb1de]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Prevalence of statin and other lipid lowering medication prescriptions stratified by ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline eligibility criteria, for patients age 40 to 75 in 2013 and 2017

The prevalence of statin eligibility was slightly higher in 2017 (62.3% overall) with a similar distribution of patients across the eligibility categories compared to 2013 (Table 2). In 2017, there was minimal change in use of statin therapy compared to 2013 with 62.3% of patients prescribed a statin. There was an increase in use of high intensity statins with 24.3% of statin eligible patients on a high intensity statin including 49.9% of those with clinical ASCVD. There was a decrease in use of statin therapy in patients at low ASCVD risk with 11.5% of low risk patient prescribed a statin in 2017 compared to 14.9% in 2013. In 2017, the use of ezetimibe remained infrequent (2.4%) with rare use of PCSK9 inhibitors (0.1%). In 2017, 2.8% of the sample was listed as having a statin allergy but 76% of those with a statin allergy had an active order for statin therapy. Using a more conservative measure for statin use by requiring an active statin prescription during the last documented patient encounter for each year resulted in a slightly lower prevalence of statin use in eligible patients (58.1% in 2013, and 59.5% in 2017).

We also examined the use of statin therapy in those statin eligible according to sex. Women were less likely to receive statin therapy in both 2013 and 2017 (Figure 2). In 2017, 72.8% of men were statin eligible, compared to 53.1% of women. Of statin eligible men, 66.4% were prescribed a statin compared to 57.4% of statin eligible women (P < .001). Women were less likely to receive treatment within each of the statin eligibility categories (Table 3).

### Hypothyroidism as a risk factor for statin intolerance [^90af8479]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications because of their proven cardiovascular benefits. However, statin intolerance occurs in 5% to 20% of patients. Understanding the basis for statin intolerance remains a key issue in preventive medicine.

Objectives

To evaluate the association of statin intolerance with hypothyroidism in a large integrated health care system, including its sex-specific relationship and subsequent statin rechallenge and prescription history.

Methods

The Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical record database identified patients (n = 2686; males = 1276, females = 1410) with a documentation of intolerance ("allergy") to at least 1 statin. Age and sex similar controls (n = 8103; males = 3892, females = 4211) were identified among patients prescribed statins without documented intolerance. Patients were evaluated for a history of hypothyroidism, development of hypothyroidism, and statin prescription history up to 5 years of follow-up.

Results

A total of 30.2% patients (210 males, 16.5%; 602 females, 42.7%) with statin intolerance had a history of hypothyroidism compared with 21.5% of statin-tolerant patients (475 males, 12.2%; 1266 females, 30.1%), for an odds ratio (OR) in the total population of 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–1.65; P < .0001); in males, OR was 1.29 (CI 1.07–1.55; P = 0.001); in females, OR was 1.60 (CI 1.41–1.82; P < .0001). During follow-up, patients with statin intolerance and hypothyroidism were less likely to be on a statin than their statin-intolerant counterparts without hypothyroidism (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.75–0.94; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Hypothyroidism is more prevalent in those with statin intolerance, both in males and, especially, in females. People with hypothyroidism are less likely to have a prescription for a statin at follow-up than those without hypothyroidism.

### Classification and epidemiology of hypersensitivity drug reactions [^abc09e4f]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Nonimmune hypersensitivity reactions are unpredictable adverse drug reactions that are clinically similar to allergic reactions for which no drug-specific antibodies or T lymphocytes are identified. Few tools allow a definite diagnosis, and most of the available ones need to be validated. True epidemiologic data are limited, and most of the available information on the incidence, mortality, and socioeconomic impact should be discussed with caution.

### Prevalence of statin intolerance: a meta-analysis [^271da7a4]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Articles were eligible if they reported the prevalence of SI either in primary or secondary prevention and met the following inclusion criteria: (i) trials or cohorts reporting SI, (ii) at least 100 participants included in the analysis, and (iii) available criteria for SI diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies with unclear methodologies to obtain the estimates of SI frequency, (ii) studies that investigated a statin that has been withdrawn from the market, (iii) ongoing trials (unless they reported relevant interim results), (iv) studies only investigating statin discontinuation without specifying intolerance, and (v) short follow-up (< 1.5 month/6 weeks).

The search, screening, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers (I.B. and J.R.); any disagreements were resolved through discussion with senior investigators (M.B. and P.E.P.). Non-relevant articles were excluded on the basis of title and abstract screening. For each trial, the risk of bias was independently assessed by the same investigators using the revised Cochrane RoB2 tool involving five domains (randomization process, deviation from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results). The risk of bias in each study was judged to be 'low', 'high', or 'unclear'. For the assessment of the risk of bias in cohort studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used. Three domains were evaluated with the following items: (i) selection, (ii) comparability, and (iii) exposure. The risk of bias in each study was judged to be 'good', 'fair', or 'poor'.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^8b1c7867]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Drug challenge decision-making — Drug challenges can be particularly helpful in determining specific drug tolerance when a reaction occurs in the setting of multiple concomitant drug exposures. Shared decision making may be used in patients with a higher pretest probability of true allergy or a history of more severe reactions when the benefit of drug therapy outweighs the risks.

### Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials on the prevalence of statin intolerance [^bc4632ca]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of intolerance varies widely. Stopping statin therapy is associated with worse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive studies, the benefits and risks of statins continue to be debated by clinicians and the lay public. We searched the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases for all randomized controlled trials of statins compared with placebo. Studies were included if they had ≥ 1,000 participants, had patients who were followed up for ≥ 1 year, and reported rates of drug discontinuation. Studies were pooled as per the random effects model. A total of 22 studies (statins = 66,024, placebo = 63,656) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed that, over a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, the rates of discontinuation were 13.3% (8,872 patients) for statin-treated patients and 13.9% (8,898 patients) for placebo-treated patients. The random effects model showed no significant difference between the placebo and statin arms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 to 1.06). The results were similar for both primary prevention (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.05, p = 0.39) and secondary prevention (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.05, p = 0.43) studies. The pooled analysis suggested that the rates of myopathy were also similar between the statins and placebos (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.62, p = 0.25). In conclusion, this meta-analysis of > 125,000 patients suggests that the rate of drug discontinuation and myopathy does not significantly differ between statin- and placebo-treated patients in randomized controlled trials. These findings are limited by the heterogeneity of results, the variable duration of follow-up, and the lower doses of statins compared with contemporary clinical practice.

### Reported muscle symptoms during statin treatment amongst Italian dyslipidaemic patients in the real-life setting: the PROSISA study [^99fe8149]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In the absence of a unique definition, Consensus documents by European and Canadian Groups proposed to define SAMS according to the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation. Moreover, withdrawal (dechallenge) and re‐exposure (rechallenge) to statin treatment have been suggested by current guidelines as useful tool to screen whether reported muscle symptoms are truly associated with statin medication. Usually, after this approach, the diagnosis of SAMS is confirmed only in 5%–6% of patients. This percentage further decreases to 2%–3% if a gradual diagnostic approach is applied, which includes the following: (i) meticulous physical examination of the patient, (ii) evaluation of previous history and (iii) evaluation of drug interactions and exclusion of possible risk factors for SAMS, including the nocebo effect, which is associated with the person's prior expectations of adverse effects from treatment as well as with conditioning in which the person learns from prior experiences to associate a medication with certain somatic symptoms or from observations of symptoms in other patients. Indeed, available data show that the reported incidence of SAMS is consistently lower in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) than in observational studies. This evidence, combined with the absence of a univocal definition and the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation, makes it challenging to estimate the incidence of this phenomenon, especially in a real‐world context. Therefore, the main aim of the PROSISA (PROject Statin Intolerance SISA) study was to assess the prevalence of statin intolerance, due to muscular symptoms, in a cohort of dyslipidaemic patients on statin therapy in a real‐life setting.

### Statin desensitization in a patient with probable familial hypercholesterolemia [^cb95b917]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Problem Overview

With cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, cholesterol-lowering medications have become a prominent focus of medical management and cardiovascular risk reduction, including the use of statins making them the most widely prescribed class of medications in the United States and are the cornerstone of management of hyperlipidemia. This case report describes a 29-year-old female with probable familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who had allergic reactions to statin therapy on two separate occasions. She required statin therapy based on her elevated carotid intima media thickness test, historic LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, elevated Lp(a), and family history significant for premature coronary heart disease. In this report, we document a case of successful oral desensitization to rosuvastatin and propose a replicable statin desensitization protocol.

Major Management

The patient was admitted for rosuvastatin desensitization following predetermined protocols, utilizing an interdisciplinary team, and monitored for 24 hours following completion of administration prior to discharge. She successfully completed desensitization to rosuvastatin 10mg by mouth daily without anaphylactic reaction. She continued to tolerate rosuvastatin 10mg daily through most recent follow-up, and with this addition, significant improvement in lipid levels was achieved.

Conclusion

This case report presented a patient with probable FH who was previously intolerant to other statin therapies that underwent successful desensitization to rosuvastatin with subsequent achievement of therapy goals.

### Assessment of pharmacogenetic tests: presenting measures of clinical validity and potential population impact in association studies [^243a7953]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This article illustrates how the clinical validity and population impact of pharmacogenetic tests may vary with the population and setting in which tests are used. ORs, variant frequencies and adverse event frequencies often differ between (sub)populations, for example, according to ethnic background and gender, and therewith cause the clinical validity and potential population impact to vary between populations. Also, changes in the definition and measurement of the adverse event phenotype may impact the observed performance of genetic tests, as the different classification of individuals with and without the adverse event may lead to different adverse event frequencies and ORs.

The calculation of the potential population impact comes with assumptions that impact its interpretation. PAF, NNT and NNG assume that changing treatment for patients who carry the genetic variant will lower their adverse event risk to the same level as the risk in the group who do not carry this variant. This assumption may be more realistic for some interventions than for others. The assumptions for PAF, NNT and NNG may hold in case the adverse event is rare. In this case, the adverse event risk after changing treatment will approximate the adverse event risk in patients who do not carry the genetic variant. A similar scenario is observed when the adverse event also has other causes than the drug treatment. For simvastatin, several placebo-controlled trials using statins have demonstrated that adverse event rates in the placebo group were comparable to the group treated with statins. For abacavir, the rate of clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity reactions that cannot be immunologically confirmed was similar to the rates of hypersensitivity reactions (2–7%) among patients not receiving abacavir in double-blind comparative-treatment studies. We therefore assumed that for both examples in this article the assumptions for PAF, NNT and NNG were reasonable.

### Atorvastatin hypersensitivity reaction within 24 hours of first dose [^ac395961]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We report a case of atorvastatin-induced hypersensitivity reaction in a 58-year-old male following first exposure to the drug. The patient took one dose of atorvastatin 40 mg and presented to the emergency department (ED) within 24 h with a chief complaint of throat swelling, trouble swallowing, and throat pain. The patient did not have pruritis or skin manifestations. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. However, the patient had leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.68 × 10 3 /mcL. Eosinophils were within normal limits at 1.6 × 10 3 /mcL. Bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 mg/dL. The patient was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, and diphenhydramine, and his symptoms began to resolve within 15 min. Statin-induced hypersensitivity reactions could be explained by statins' effects on bradykinin 2 receptors that potentiate vasodilation and leading to angioedema. In the literature, cases of hypersensitivity associated with atorvastatin present after months of cumulative exposure. Therefore, this case is unique in that a reaction developed within 24 h of that first dose.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of simvastatin: pruritus, alopecia, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails), dizziness, muscle cramps, myalgia, pancreatitis, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, anemia, erectile dysfunction, interstitial lung disease, rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis/jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, and depression.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included some of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).

### Statin myopathy: an update [^0fe32978]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction. Associated with statin popularity are misconceptions and fears of untoward side effects on muscle. This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease; explores potential pathogenic mechanisms; reviews current estimates of statin myopathy prevalence; and examines diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Summary

As a class, statins appear to be usually safe, well tolerated agents with an excellent risk: benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood owing to the relative rarity of its existence.

### Statins for asthma [^89d70043]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. People with asthma have inflammation of their airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness, with or without a cough. Statins possess multiple therapeutic effects, including lowering lipid levels in the blood. Statins are reported to have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in asthma. However, comprehensive evidence of the benefits and harms of using statins is required to facilitate decision making.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of statins as an adjunct therapy for asthma in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched for studies in the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid SP and Embase Ovid SP, from their inception dates We handsearched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences. We also searched clinical trials registries for completed, ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. The search is current to 7 February 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel-group design that assessed statins for at least 12 weeks' duration. We considered all participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma to be eligible, regardless of age, sex, disease severity and previous or current treatment. We planned to include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened and selected the studies, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We resolved any disagreement through discussion.

Main Results

We found only one trial involving a total of 60 people living with asthma. The trial compared the effect of atorvastatin with a placebo (dummy treatment containing lactose) in treating people with chronic asthma. The trial did not report data for the primary outcomes or adverse events. There was uncertainty about the relative effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group. The study did not report serious adverse effects for the interventions. The included study had internal discrepancies in its reported data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence was of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of statins to treat asthma. High-quality RCTs are needed to assess the effect of statins on people with asthma. Well-designed multicentre trials with larger samples and longer duration of treatment are required, which assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and costs, to provide better quality evidence. Future studies that include subgroups of obese people with asthma are also required.

### An assessment of statin safety by nephrologists [^a9f8e88b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Recently, concerns regarding potential adverse effects of the statins on the kidney have been raised. The Kidney Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association's (NLA) Safety Task Force, made up of 3 nephrologists, was convened to review all of the currently available evidence pertinent to determining whether statins cause kidney injury, independent of the known, rare mechanisms of rhabdomyolysis and allergic, drug-induced, interstitial nephritis. The Panel reviewed published and unpublished evidence and found none that suggested that statins, when used in doses currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cause kidney injury.

### Reported muscle symptoms during statin treatment amongst Italian dyslipidaemic patients in the real-life setting: the PROSISA study [^c33079ca]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

However, the evaluation of the prevalence of muscle‐related signs and symptoms during statin treatment is challenging. Nowadays, the true incidence is unknown: clinicians lack effective biomarkers and tests to confirm diagnosis. The majority of patients reporting SAMS do not present plasma CK elevation, making CK not a reliable nor a clinically meaningful biomarker to properly diagnose statin intolerance, whilst a pretreatment increased CK is an indication to search for primary myopathy, although there may be other reasons for an increase in CK, such as intense physical activity. Moreover, it is difficult to get rid of the supposed nocebo effect underlying a vast proportion of reported SAMS. Recent studies suggest that only 30%–50% of patients with self‐reported statin myalgia, as highlighted by a careful clinical examination of the patient, actually experience muscle pain because of statins and not from other causes, highlighted by a careful clinical examination of the patient that may be indeed associated with muscle symptoms. A large portion of supposed statin muscle side effects are likely nonspecific, and several confounders make the diagnosis and treatment of statin myalgia difficult. Accordingly, slightly more than one third of PROSISA patients complaining of SAMS still reported SAMS after dechallenge/rechallenge. However, it should be pointed out that, beside the confirmation of the diagnosis, physicians often deal with patients who complain of discomfort during the treatment and who asks to stop it (or sometimes discontinue the treatment spontaneously, without consulting the physician). A lack of 'shared decision‐making' seemed quite common amongst current statin users, and this represents a critical point to be addressed to enhance not only statin adherence, but also patient satisfaction and quality of life on statin therapy.

### Predictors of a successful statin reattempt after an adverse reaction [^dc5311eb]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients can tolerate statin therapy after an adverse reaction. However, optimal patient selection criteria and methods of reattempting statin therapy after an adverse reaction are unknown.

Objective

To identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with a successful statin reattempt after an adverse reaction.

Methods

We retrospectively studied adults treated in primary care practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers between 2000 and 2012 who reattempted statin therapy after an adverse reaction. Statin reattempts were considered successful if the patient had at least 2 statin prescriptions after discontinuation of the original statin, and had an active electronic medical record statin record at 2 years after the adverse reaction.

Results

Among 6196 patients included in the study, 4536 (73.2%) successfully reattempted statin therapy. In multivariable analysis, history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.195; P = 0.008) and reattempted treatment with a different statin (OR 1.463; P < .0001) were associated with greater odds of a successful reattempt. Adverse reaction during the first year after statin initiation (OR 0.721; P < .0001) or myalgia or myopathy (OR 0.807; P = 0.001) as well as history of adverse reactions to nonstatin drugs (OR 0.908; P < .0001) were associated with lower odds.

Conclusions

Nature and timing of the adverse reaction, patient's medical history and the medication prescribed affected the likelihood of a successful reattempt of statin therapy after an adverse reaction. These findings suggest that a patient-centered approach to restarting statins should be considered for patients at high cardiovascular risk to improve the chances of success.

### Cardiology clinic visit increases likelihood of evidence-based cholesterol prescribing in severe hypercholesterolemia [^819ac419]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

We found less than half of all patients with diabetes were on a high‐intensity statin and just over 63% of hypertension patients were receiving any intensity of statin therapy. This is slightly better than a previous study of a German diabetes registry which showed that of 51 640 SH patients with type 2 diabetes, 25.5% were prescribed a statin. 14 A recent study at another large health system found that in 2017, 59.4% of patients with an LDL > 190 were on a statin and a percentage similar to our cohort were on ezetimibe (2.5%) and PCSK9 inhibitors (0.7%). 20

Despite the overwhelming evidence for lipid‐lowering medication use, less than half of our patients with phenotypic SH were prescribed lipid‐lowering medication at a large healthcare system. Similar results have been seen in previous studies examining the use of lipid‐lowering medications. 8, 9, 21, 22 Bradley C.K. et al. 8 analyzed 5693 patients from the PALM registry (designed to evaluate lipid management practices as well as patient/provider beliefs on statin therapy) and found that 26.5% were not on treatment, while more than half of patients who were eligible for statin therapy but not taking any lipid‐lowering medication reported never being offered treatment. The trends in lipid‐lowering medication use between patients seen by cardiology and those not seen may provide some insight into why there is a such a discrepancy in treatment despite eligibility of the patients. A 2015 AHA/ACC national survey reported that 22% of the primary care providers (compared to 33% of specialists, including cardiology and endocrinology) surveyed knew the definition of high‐, intermediate‐, and low‐intensity statin therapy. 23 Results showing higher lipid‐lowering medication use in patients who have been seen by cardiology may suggest a persistent effort put forward by cardiology to re‐challenge with a statin or explore alternative agents to statins when one statin may have previously caused an allergy or intolerance to the patient. 10 In the future, adoption of quality measures that includes either appropriate percent lowering of LDL‐cholesterol, such as 50% lowering, and/or specific targets, such as LDL‐c < 70 mg/dl, should be required for those with ASCVD or for higher risk primary prevention. Those at high‐risk need to engage in a risk discussion with their clinician regarding the potential for benefit versus risk for additional cholesterol lowering therapy, such as ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Moreover, risk discussions should remind physicians to increase statin intensity as necessary for patients with a history of SH. Other options for assisting in the discrepancy between eligibility for and use of high‐intensity statins may include use of computer prompts based on diagnoses and increased use of support staff like pharmacists and nurses to educate patients about the importance of lowering their LDL‐c to goal through the use of lipid‐lowering medications.

### Breaking down statin myopathy: understanding the self-limited and autoimmune subtypes [^e6bc5a77]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used crucial drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although generally well tolerated, statin intolerance can unfortunately limit statin use, with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) being the most common side effect associated with its discontinuation. Statin intolerance is an inability to tolerate a dose of statin required to sufficiently reduce an individual's cardiovascular risk, limiting the effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statin myopathy is a broad entity encompassing self-limited/toxic and autoimmune aetiologies. As statins are a mainstay of therapy in those with or at risk for CVD and offer a mortality benefit, it is critical to determine whether one's symptoms are truly statin-associated before discontinuing the drug. This review article aims to provide an update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, evaluation and management of statin myopathy and to elucidate key differences between autoimmune and self-limited types.

### New insights into managing symptoms during statin therapy [^7e4d103e]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms during statin therapy are common and often attributed to statin intolerance. Recent data suggest few patients are truly intolerant to statins. Muscle symptoms are similar in statin and control groups in blinded treatment periods of clinical trials. The "nocebo" effect may occur during open-label statin treatment, when previously asymptomatic study participants report symptoms attributed to statin therapy, or during placebo-controlled trials. Most patients reporting statin intolerance can tolerate blinded moderate intensity statin therapy. In clinical practice the large majority of patients are willing to retry a statin, and of those who do, > 80–90% successfully remain on statin therapy long-term. Emerging evidence from brain imaging studies and contemporary approaches to pain management suggests that building trust and managing patient expectations can minimize the "nocebo" effect in statin-treated patients.

### The STatin adverse treatment experience survey: experience of patients reporting side effects of statin therapy [^6d2e3915]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Statin-associated symptoms and clinical impact — prevalence and risks are reported as follows: The number of U.S. adults for whom statin therapy is recommended increased to 56 million individuals, and during 2012 to 2013, an estimated 28% of adults aged ≥ 40 years (39.2 million individuals) were taking statins, with 43% of adults aged 60 to 74 years and 48% of adults aged ≥ 75 years receiving therapy during 2011 to 2012. In clinical practice and observational studies, approximately 10% to 29% of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms, and these adverse experiences are a major factor for a change in statin therapy, nonadherence, or discontinuation. In the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Education (USAGE) survey, muscle-related side effects were more commonly reported in former statin users (60%) vs current statin users (25%). In a real-world clinical setting, approximately 17% of patients experienced a statin-related event. In a large Medicare population (N = 105,329) receiving statin therapy after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, those who experienced statin intolerance had a 50% higher risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and a 51% higher risk of being hospitalized for recurrent cardiovascular events.

5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

VASCEPA is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 statin-treated subjects with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes plus an additional risk factor for CVD, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with VASCEPA compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy

VASCEPA contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to VASCEPA. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to VASCEPA and advise them to discontinue VASCEPA and seek medical attention if any reactions occur.

5.3 Bleeding

VASCEPA is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving VASCEPA experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on VASCEPA vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^d26d39b9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Switching Statins, Low‐Dose and/or Alternate‐Day Statins

The truly causal adverse effects of statins are probably related to efficacy in inhibition of HMG‐CoA reductase and therefore entirely attributable to intensity of statin therapy. Switching statins probably will not help reduce adverse effects except when weaker statins or lower doses of statins are used. A useful maneuver may be alternate‐day low‐dose statin in combination with ezetimibe. A case report illustrates this.

### A new case of allergic contact dermatitis to topical simvastatin used for treatment of porokeratosis [^2c2b6858]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Discussion

Porokeratosis is a heterogeneous group of cutaneous disorders characterised by abnormal keratinization secondary to somatic genetic alterations in the mevalonate pathway in some subsets, resulting in a reduction of skin cholesterol content and an accumulation of toxic metabolites (i.e. mevalonate) in these cases. Accordingly, topical cholesterol/statin therapy has recently been proposed as a pathogenesis‐directed treatment for various forms of porokeratosis to prevent the accumulation of mevalonate in the skin (via statins) while compensating for cholesterol deficiency and has proven to be effective.

Topical statin treatment is usually considered safe although the follow‐up in most reports has been brief (< 12 weeks). To our knowledge, only one case of allergic contact dermatitis to simvastatin in a compounded preparation has been reported in a patient concurrently receiving oral rosuvastatin for hypercholesterolemia without any notable side effects. In our case, chronic intermittent application over a prolonged period may have promoted sensitisation. Additionally, the potential for enhanced skin penetration of simvastatin due to the presence of glycols, such as propylene glycol and pentylene glycol in the second preparation cannot be ruled out, leading also to an increased risk of cutaneous sensitisation. Interestingly, simvastatin has already been identified as a skin sensitiser, with a few cases of airborne sensitisation, most often considered as an occupational allergic contact dermatitis. Another statin, lovastatin (which is not available in France) is also used in compounded preparations for similar indications but no cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported with this molecule to date.

Cross‐reactions with other commercially available oral statins, particularly pravastatin (which shares a naphthalene ring structure with simvastatin and lovastatin) were not observed in our patient (Figure S1).

Statin rechallenge expectations in SAMS counseling emphasize that "it can be helpful to frame expectations regarding tolerability", because "Tolerability discussions provide a helpful perspective for the patient to reflect on functional status and quality of life rather than an expectation for completely symptom-free therapy". Patients should know that "An individual could experience mild tolerable muscle symptoms for the first 2–4 weeks, which later resolve", and that "statin rechallenge may not cause the same symptoms, particularly after a dose reduction or change to another statin", with the aim that "Setting the stage for positive but realistic expectations may facilitate improved patient outcomes".

FIGURE 2
Results of a cross‐sectional cohort study, estimating statin utilization by intensity, from an electronic medical record‐based hyperlipidemia registry (n = 14 867; defined as ever having an LDL‐c ≥ 190 mg/dl since January 1, 2000)

After adjusting for age, sex, CVD, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, SH patients who had been seen by cardiology had greater odds of being on any lipid‐lowering medication, high‐intensity statin, or PCSK9 inhibitor compared to those who had not been seen by cardiology (Table 2). When comparing patients without ASCVD (n = 495), those who had been seen by cardiology were more likely to be prescribed a statin compared to patients only seen by primary care (n = 10 402; 62.4 vs. 52.1%, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between sex and lipid‐lowering medication use. Males were more likely than females to be prescribed any lipid‐lowering medication (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71–0.81), high‐intensity statin (OR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.29–0.32), or PCSK9i (OR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32–0.89).

Patients seen by cardiology had a significantly lower mean LDL‐c than those not recently seen by cardiology (126.8 + 51.6 mg/dl vs. 152.4 + 50.2 mg/dl; p < .001) (Table 1). About 38% (n = 683) of patients seen by cardiology had their LDL controlled to < 100 mg/dl and 11% (n = 198) to < 70 mg/dL compared to patients not seen by cardiology (17.6% (n = 2301) LDL‐c < 100 mg/dL and 2.9% (n = 380) LDL‐c < 70 mg/dl; Figure 3). Of the 372 patients seen by cardiology without a current lipid‐lowering medication prescription, 39.2% had a documented statin allergy or intolerance compared to 15.0% of the 5601 patients not seen by cardiology.

### Prevalence of statin intolerance: a meta-analysis [^bc49047c]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite continuous improvement of medical treatment, diagnosis, and risk factor control. It has been clearly demonstrated that statin therapy confers significant mortality and morbidity benefits in both the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Although statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy is an ongoing problem worldwide. The most common cause of discontinuation of statin therapy is statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Other possible statin-related adverse effects include neurocognitive disorders, hepatotoxicity, haemorrhagic stroke, and renal toxicity. These conditions may lead to discontinuation, but causality has been confirmed only for SAMS, temporary elevation of aminotransferase alanine, and newly diagnosed diabetes. According to the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP), statin intolerance (SI) is an inability to tolerate a dose of statin required to sufficiently reduce an individual's CV risk, limiting the effective treatment of patients at risk of, or with, CVD. The National Lipid Association (NLA) has a wider definition, including any adverse effects relating to the quality of life and leading to the decision to decrease or stop the use of an otherwise beneficial drug. The Luso-Latin American Consortium (LLAC) definition of SI is similar to that of the Canadian Consensus Working Group (CCWG). It refers to an inability to tolerate ≥ 2 statins at any dose or an inability to tolerate increasing doses. The symptoms must not be attributable to drug–drug interactions or conditions known to increase SI. They indicate that symptomatic criteria include intolerable muscle symptoms [pain, weakness, or cramps with or without creatine kinase (CK) changes] or severe myopathy, and they must appear in the first 12 weeks after initiating treatment or following an increase in dose.

The prevalence of SI is widely debated, in part because of difficulties in identification and diagnosis, possible interaction of different risk factors, different diseases, drugs, and other clinical and demographic indices. In contrast with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (prevalence usually 5–7%), cohort studies suggest that SI occurs in as many as 30% of treated patients. However, this is likely to be an overestimate or underestimate and in many cases, the symptoms are likely to be attributable to the nocebo/drucebo effect.

Because of these inconsistent findings, the present meta-analysis aimed to estimate the overall prevalence of SI, its prevalence according to various diagnostic criteria, in different disease settings, and to identify possible risk factors for SI.

### Differentiating between a prasugrel-induced hypersensitivity reaction and an atorvastatin-induced DRESS syndrome in the post-percutaneous coronary intervention setting [^629da7c7]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Statins and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel, are first-line therapies with significant mortality benefits after acute coronary syndrome, with dual-antiplatelet therapy recommended in the first month-to-year postdrug-eluting stent placement to prevent in-stent thrombosis. Although rare, hypersensitivity reactions to these agents warrant attention. Statins, particularly atorvastatin, have been associated with isolated case reports of DRESS syndrome. Conversely, although clopidogrel, another P2Y12 inhibitor, has been implicated in DRESS syndrome, prasugrel has not been previously reported as a causative agent. However, several reports of prasugrel-induced exanthematous hypersensitivity reactions have been documented, including one describing liver involvement and peripheral eosinophilia — features that may represent undiagnosed DRESS syndrome. Although DRESS syndrome typically presents 2 to 8 weeks after the initiation of the offending medication, shorter latency periods have been documented in the literature, particularly in older patients and those with multiple comorbidities. Additionally, although DRESS may take weeks to months to resolve after cessation of the offending drug, prasugrel-associated hypersensitivity reactions typically resolve within a few days.

Concurrent initiation of both medications complicates identification of the culprit drug. Considering that the majority of existing reports of prasugrel hypersensitivity reactions do not present with organ involvement, the patient's eosinophilia and liver involvement favor a diagnosis of DRESS syndrome. The higher frequency of atorvastatin-associated DRESS reported in the literature also increases suspicion of atorvastatin as the more likely offending agent. As concurrent drug reactions could not be ruled out, the decision was made to continue the alternative P2Y12 inhibitor, clopidogrel, and discontinue atorvastatin, as alternative lipid-lowering agents could considered after resolution of acute illness. Given that poststent patients are started on multiple drugs for mortality reduction, laboratory monitoring in the presence of morbilliform rash after coadministration of atorvastatin and prasugrel should be considered.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience for ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or ezetimibe or simvastatin: pruritus; alopecia; erythema multiforme; a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails); dizziness; muscle cramps; myalgia; arthralgia; pancreatitis; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy; vomiting; nausea; anemia; erectile dysfunction; interstitial lung disease; myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; hepatitis/jaundice; fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure; depression; cholelithiasis; cholecystitis; thrombocytopenia; elevations in liver transaminases; elevated creatine phosphokinase.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported.

In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely that has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).

Statin intolerance — evaluation and causality considerations emphasize risk factor assessment and acknowledgment of uncertainty. "When a statin is prescribed and/or when an intolerance is identified, it is important to evaluate for modifiable risk factors", which "may predispose a patient to experience an intolerance, and correction of the risk factor may mitigate adverse effects". The document also states, "Controversy exists regarding the causality of the associations between statin therapy and adverse experiences that produce intolerance", that placebo-controlled studies suggest a contribution from the "nocebo" effect, and that the terminology "associated with statin therapy" is used to acknowledge that causality is sometimes uncertain.

---

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^fc10538e]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statins are considered very effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. However, although adherence to statins improves morbidity and mortality, it remains suboptimal. One of the most important causes of nonadherence is the so-called statin intolerance, mainly because of muscle-related symptoms. These symptoms most often consist of myalgia unaccompanied by significant creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Less often, myositis (elevated CK > 10 times the upper limit of normal) or rhabdomyolysis (CK level > 10,000 IU/L or accompanied by significant elevation in creatinine level) develops.

In randomized controlled trials, the incidence of statin myopathy is ~1.5–5.0%. However, this low incidence may be misleading for several reasons. First, in most studies patients with a history of statin intolerance were excluded. Other studies had a single-blinded statin run-in phase, and patients experiencing muscle-related symptoms or CK elevations during this phase were excluded. Patients who tend to be at risk for developing muscle-related symptoms, such as women, elderly patients, and patients with significant comorbidity, who comprise a large proportion of statin-treated patients in real-life settings, are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials. Some studies have defined muscle-related effects by elevated CK levels only, disregarding myalgia. Last but not least, patients enrolled in studies might be motivated and so minimize reporting of mild myalgias, thus leading to underestimation of the magnitude of the problem.

### Aspirin hypersensitivity: a practical guide for cardiologists [^4757cfbc]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aspirin has been known for a long time and currently stays as a cornerstone of antithrombotic therapy in cardiovascular disease. In patients with either acute or chronic coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention aspirin is mandatory in a dual antiplatelet therapy regimen for prevention of stent thrombosis and/or new ischaemic events. Aspirin is also currently a first-option antithrombotic therapy after an aortic prosthetic valve replacement and is occasionally required in addition to oral anticoagulants after implantation of a mechanical valve. Presumed or demonstrated aspirin hypersensitivity is a main clinical problem, limiting the use of a life-saving medication. In the general population, aspirin hypersensitivity has a prevalence of 0.6%-2.5% and has a plethora of clinical presentations, ranging from aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease to anaphylaxis. Although infrequent, when encountered in clinical practice aspirin hypersensitivity poses for cardiologists a clinical dilemma, which should never be trivialized, avoiding-as much as possible-omission of the drug. We here review the epidemiology of aspirin hypersensitivity, provide an outline of pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical presentations, and review management options, starting from a characterization of true aspirin allergy-in contrast to intolerance-to suggestion of desensitization protocols.

### Continued statin prescriptions after adverse reactions and patient outcomes: a cohort study [^d8000e5f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients discontinue statin treatment, often after having a possible adverse reaction. The risks and benefits of continued statin therapy after an adverse reaction are not known.

Objective

To examine the relationship between continuation of statin therapy (any prescription within 12 months after an adverse reaction) and clinical outcomes.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Primary care practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers.

Participants

Patients with a presumed adverse reaction to a statin between 2000 and 2011.

Measurements

Information on adverse reactions to statins was obtained from structured electronic medical record data or natural-language processing of narrative provider notes. The primary composite outcome was time to a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke) or death.

Results

Most (81%) of the adverse reactions to statins were identified from the text of electronic provider notes. Among 28 266 study patients, 19 989 (70.7%) continued receiving statin prescriptions after the adverse reaction. Four years after the presumed adverse event, the cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome was 12.2% for patients with continued statin prescriptions, compared with 13.9% for those without them (difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.7%]; P < 0.001). In a secondary analysis of 7604 patients for whom a different statin was prescribed after the adverse reaction, 2014 (26.5%) had a documented adverse reaction to the second statin, but 1696 (84.2%) of those patients continued receiving statin prescriptions.

Limitations

The risk for recurrent adverse reactions to statins could not be established for the entire sample. It was also not possible to determine whether patients actually took the statins.

Conclusion

Continued statin prescriptions after an adverse reaction were associated with a lower incidence of death and cardiovascular events.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^9441f8d5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — incidence and key clinical points — notes that the incidence of statin intolerance ranges between approximately 5% and 30%, with variability by population and setting. It is reasonable to attribute some proportion of statin-associated symptoms to the nocebo effect; however, this does not make such symptoms less clinically relevant. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk related to elevated levels of atherogenic lipoproteins should be addressed in patients with statin-associated adverse effects, regardless of causality.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^5c9cbb2d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — prevalence signals from surveys indicate that statin-associated muscle symptoms are an important contributor to statin non-adherence and discontinuation. In the Statin Adverse Treatment Experience (STATE) survey of 1500 patients with high cholesterol who had taken a statin within the past two years and experienced at least one statin-associated symptom within the prior six months, 332 individuals (22.1%) reported having discontinued statin therapy; however, data from the STATE survey cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of statin intolerance in clinical practice. In the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Education (USAGE) survey, 10,138 respondents were current (n = 8918) or former (n = 1220) statin users, muscle-related side effects were reported by 60% of former statin users and 35% of current statin users, side effects were cited as the reason for stopping among 62% of former users (756 of the 1220 patients), and if these results are extrapolated to the entire USAGE participant population discontinuation due to statin-associated side effects was 7.5% (756 of 10,138).

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^d605ce0b]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement — statin intolerance definition and management defines statin intolerance as one or more adverse effects associated with statin therapy which resolves or improves with dose reduction or discontinuation and states it can be classified as a complete inability to tolerate any dose of a statin or partial intolerance with inability to tolerate the dose necessary to achieve the patient-specific therapeutic objective. Prevalence is reported in 5–30% of patients and contributes to reduced statin adherence and persistence, as well as higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. To classify a patient as having statin intolerance, a minimum of two statins should have been attempted, including at least one at the lowest approved daily dosage. The statement acknowledges the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors for statin intolerance and recognizes the possibility of a "nocebo" effect. To identify a tolerable statin regimen it is recommended that clinicians consider using several different strategies (e.g., different statin, dose, and/or dosing frequency).

### Errors in electronic health record-based data query of statin prescriptions in patients with coronary artery disease in a large, academic, multispecialty clinic practice [^35eddf73]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In our initiative, there were 4 major reasons for errors of classification by automated EHR‐based query. The most common cause of classification error was ambiguity between the umbrella term CAD versus the most recent guideline definition of coronary ASCVD. Although most clinicians agree that < 50% lesions on left heart catheterization or coronary artery calcifications represent an early spectrum of coronary ASCVD requiring further risk stratification and modification, these patients do not necessarily satisfy the criteria for a class 1 recommendation for statin therapy on the basis of clinically manifest coronary ASCVD alone. The next most common reason for erroneous classification was due to the clinical provider not appropriately revising the EHR face sheet to reflect clinical data. This includes cases in which the provider listed a statin exemption in the free‐text portion of the note only, which prevented detection by automated data query. It also includes cases in which providers did not revise or remove ASCVD‐equivalent diagnoses from the problem list if the patient was either asymptomatic or underwent negative stress testing. The third most common reason was related to the EHR detection algorithm not incorporating appropriate inclusion or exclusion criteria. This includes patients for whom the provider listed a statin exemption or prescription in a discrete EHR data field. The authors determined that the detection algorithm was overly strict in these cases because if a patient had been discontinued from a statin at any point during the review period, regardless of whether he or she had been on a statin for the majority of the year or even restarted on a statin during the review period, the patient would have been classified as not being on a statin for the year. As for statin exemptions, the Medicare GPRO specifications dictated that it was not merely sufficient to list "statins" on the allergy list. If the "reaction" to statins in the allergy list was specified as "side effect" rather than "allergy" or "intolerance", the CDW detection algorithm did not classify this as a proper statin exemption. In addition, the EHR data query algorithm included patients with NYHA class II–IV heart failure who would be exempt from statin therapy, as per AHA/ACC guidelines. Finally, the fourth most common reason for erroneous classification was integration of administrative billing data (Table 4).

### A register-based cohort study on the effectiveness and safety of anti-PCSK9 treatment in persons with hyperlipidemia [^5b5ae242]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, we analyzed the data of all persons taking alirocumab on February 1, 2021, who were still alive on December 31 of that year. In a recent meta-analysis on statin intolerance, the authors identified several risk factors that were significantly associated with statin intolerance, including female sex. This finding is consistent with our observation where we identified a statistically significant disparity in gender distribution between those who switched medications and those who did not. This pattern of sex difference aligns with the broader understanding of medication tolerance and patient responses, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment approaches in lipid management. Interestingly, our data did not reveal a difference in statin allergy between those who switched PCSK9 inhibitors and those who did not, suggesting other factors may influence this decision. Notably, we observed marked differences in practices across hospitals, indicating varying adherence to guidelines issued by the Danish Medicines Council. This variation may partly explain the observed differences in medication-switching behavior.

In conclusion, our study investigated the effects of a nationwide switch from alirocumab to evolocumab on LDL-C levels, employing two distinct analytical methods. Our findings consistently revealed no significant change in LDL-C levels following this switch. While negative expectations or nocebo effects are often a concern in treatment switch studies, the objective and difficult-to-influence nature of the study outcomes, in this case, suggest that they were not a factor. These findings indicate that there is no evidence of a change in LDL-C levels because of the nationwide mandatory switch from alirocumab to evolocumab. This leads us to conclude that alirocumab and evolocumab are comparably effective in lowering LDL-C levels, thus endorsing the feasibility of switching between these treatments without compromising efficacy.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^35e2d8a7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen hypersensitivity — prevalence, diagnostic testing, and management are summarized as follows: hypersensitivity reactions are "exceedingly rare"; in a clinic review over a 4-year period, 84 patients were identified and 13 were considered to have an allergy based on history and oral challenge testing. The validity of skin testing is unknown; currently the only intravenous formulation is 10 mg/mL, with a reported protocol using 10 mg/mL for skin prick testing and 1 mg/mL as well as undiluted 10 mg/mL for intradermal testing. Other reviews used skin prick tests up to 200 mg/mL despite evidence that concentrations more than 10 mg/mL can be irritants leading to false positives. For confirmation, the current recommendations for definitive evidence of a reaction are oral-based challenge tests, and a meta-analysis including 259 patients estimates the prevalence of true acetaminophen hypersensitivity to be 10.1% in adults and 10.2% in pediatric patients.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^c2adb618]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated side effects (SASEs) — evaluation and statin rechallenge: The most-encountered SASE in clinical practice is statin-associated muscle symptoms, which may occur in 5% to 20% of patients, and in the SAMSON trial, 90% of the adverse symptom effects experienced with drug therapy can be attributed to what is seen with a blinded placebo; for patients with SASEs who meet evidence-based guideline criteria for statin therapy, avoiding complete discontinuation of statin treatment is strongly recommended. The approach to SASEs should include discontinuation of statin therapy until resolution of symptoms and subsequent rechallenge to verify recurrence of muscle-related symptoms, and most experts recommend documentation of unacceptable muscle-related symptoms that resolve and recur on at least 2 (and preferably 3) statins, with differing metabolic pathways/lipophilicity and one prescribed at the lowest approved dose. Although not studied in RCTs nor FDA approved, alternative statin regimens may include alternate-day dosing with a long half-life statin (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), de-escalation dosing (reducing 40-mg daily dosing to alternating between a 40- and a 20-mg statin every other day), or a lower daily dose (from 40 mg daily to 20 mg daily), and the majority of patients who experience SASEs are able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alternative statin or dose reduction with the same statin.

### Cardiology clinic visit increases likelihood of evidence-based cholesterol prescribing in severe hypercholesterolemia [^7d9f2485]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Medications were pulled from the patient's active medication list. Only atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg were considered high‐intensity statins. All other statin medications and doses were considered low‐ or moderate‐intensity. Due to effectiveness in LDL lowering, patients prescribed a proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor were grouped with the high‐intensity statin cohort, while patients prescribed Ezetimibe were combined with the low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin group. Statin allergies were obtained from the patient's allergy list.

Baseline risk factors were obtained from the problem list using ICD‐10 diagnoses, recent vitals, and laboratory results. Diabetes was defined as most recent glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl or A1c ≥ 6.5% or currently taking a glucose‐lowering medication. Patients who did not have lab values or medication information on file were compared against a diabetes registry and considered diabetic if they ever had an active status. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or currently taking antihypertensive medication. Patients who did not have vitals or medication information on file were compared against a hypertension registry and considered to have hypertension if they ever had an active status. Obesity was defined as body mass index ≥ 30 mg/m 2. Smoking status was asked at the most recent visit and defined as never smoker, former smoker (quit < 12 months prior), and current smoker. Prior CVD was defined as ever having an ICD‐10 diagnosis of ASCVD on their problem list (full list of ICD‐10 codes available in Appendix A). Date and value of the highest and most recent total cholesterol, LDL‐c, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐c), and triglycerides were recorded. Approximately 5% of the cohort had missing values for total cholesterol, HDL‐c, and triglycerides (n = 794; 5.3%, n = 779; 5.2%, n = 792; 5.3%, respectively).

A Consensus-based Statement is used "when there are either no published studies, or very limited and/or weak evidence". Certainty of evidence is graded as High ("Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect"), Moderate ("Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate"), Low ("Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate"), and Very low ("Any estimate of effect is very uncertain").

### A double-blinded randomized N-of-1 trial to facilitate tolerance of unblinded rosuvastatin: the DESIFOR pilot trial [^4c751f46]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Can a "n-of-1" blinded trial be used to facilitate tolerance of unblinded rosuvastatin in patients with a history of statin intolerance?

What is the main finding?

Two-thirds of patients were able to tolerate 3 months of unblinded rosuvastatin after participating in the n-of-1 study.

Statins decrease rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events but are frequently discontinued due to perceived side effects. Blinded randomized trials of statins have suggested that only approximately 1 in 15 reported muscle-related side effects are truly due to statin therapy, and 2 recent n-of-1 trials showed approximately 90% of muscle-related side effects were secondary to nocebo effect. In both n-of-1 trials, at least half of patients were willing to start unblinded statin therapy after the trial, but tolerance in that setting remains unclear. The DESIFOR (DEtermining Statin Intolerance For Rosuvastatin) pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of utilizing an n-of-1 trial to facilitate tolerance of unblinded rosuvastatin in patients with prior statin intolerance.

### Quantitative evaluation of statin effectiveness versus intolerance and strategies for management of intolerance [^e70a5f60]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

There is disquiet about statin effectiveness and side effects in both the medical and lay media.

Methods

We searched the literature for reports on the incidence of statin intolerance (SI) in which control rates of similar events were also recorded. The number of people who must receive treatment (NNT) to prevent one atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event at 5–50% 10-year risk and LDL cholesterol 2–7 mmol/l was compared with the number of those who would experience harm attributable to statin (NNH). Using a similar method, the effectiveness of various strategies to overcome SI in preventing CVD was then compared.

Results

Observational studies with non-randomised control groups report higher rates of statin adverse events than randomised trials. Overall, at least 75 patients must be treated for one to experience a side effect. In contrast, the NNT to prevent one ASCVD event with statins as monotherapy or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications to achieve at least 50% decrease in LDL cholesterol and < 1.8 mmol/l was between 3 and 61, depending on risk and LDL cholesterol. NNH for adverse events of severity equivalent to ASCVD was > 750 (< 0.1333%). When SI is encountered, the most effective current management for most patients in terms of ASCVD reduction is to rechallenge with low dose potent statin and then up-titrate until the cholesterol target has been achieved with, if necessary, the addition of ezetimibe 10 mg daily.

Conclusions

The most severe complication of SI is discontinuation of effective cholesterol-lowering treatment in patients who, by virtue of their CVD risk and cholesterol level, might otherwise benefit.

VA/DoD dyslipidemia guideline — management of statin intolerance (Recommendation 23) states: For patients who cannot tolerate a statin, we suggest a washout period followed by a re-challenge with the same or a different statin or lower dose, and if that fails, a trial of intermittent (nondaily) dosing, with strength labeled as Weak for. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that statins can usually be continued after documentation of a statin-related adverse event and that mortality is improved by continuing the treatment; in one cohort, over 6,000 patients who discontinued statins were re-challenged and over 90% were ultimately able to tolerate a statin, more than 40% were re-challenged with the same statin, at the 12-month follow-up 37% were taking the same statin at the same or a higher dose, and on average patients were re-challenged with 1.2 unique statins. Additional cohort data showed a lower incidence of death and cardiovascular events in patients who continued statins after an adverse reaction, and examined 28,266 records of patients who had at least one presumed adverse reaction to a statin.

### Statin intolerance in a referral lipid clinic [^b7369edf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Statins effectively prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but rates of statin discontinuation after adverse events are high.

Objective

Describe the range and relative frequencies of adverse events potentially attributable to statins in lipid referral practice and assess statin rechallenge outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 642 patients with statin-associated adverse events evaluated in a referral lipid clinic between January 1, 2004 and January 27, 2011.

Results

Patients experiencing adverse events by organ system included 92% with musculoskeletal, 8% central nervous system, 10% liver, 8% gastrointestinal, 5% peripheral nervous system, 5% skin, and 3% other events. Overlap of organ system involvement occurred in 22.5%. At least 1 follow-up visit was made by 557 patients, among whom overall median follow-up was 25 months. Among patients treated with a statin in the clinic, 71% remained on a statin at the last follow-up visit. Patients with hepatic transaminase increases by history were numerically more likely than the overall group to resume or remain on statin treatment, whereas those reporting central nervous system or gastrointestinal symptoms trended lower for statin maintenance. Among patients who experienced an adverse event after statin rechallenge, the majority (64%) were being treated with intermittent, nondaily dosing at the time of the adverse event.

Conclusion

Although musculoskeletal symptoms are reported by 90% of patients with statin intolerance, symptoms involving other organ systems may be more frequent than previously supposed. Understanding the range of symptoms, time course, and impact on daily activities informs counseling in patient-centered practice, but assessment of causation by statins remains challenging.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^81c5e930]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: What are your thoughts on the findings of theTask Force on Statin Intolerance?

The NLA Statin Intolerance Task Force has similarly presented a pragmatic definition of statin intolerance: "Adverse symptoms, signs and/or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient and/or provider to a statin, and perceived by the patient to interfere with daily life activities". These include predominantly muscle‐related symptoms, with muscle aches being the most common, but also may include other symptoms, liver‐enzyme increases, and isolated muscle‐enzyme increases.

Importantly, the NLA has included the phrase "real or perceived" in further describing these symptoms.

The NLA provides practical, patient‐centered recommendations that serve as an important augmentation to the ACC/AHA Guidelines.

The NLA Task Force concluded that statin intolerance requires a patient‐centered approach in practice; reducing the dose of statin, switching to a different statin, and alternate regimens, such as every‐other‐day dosing, are recommended for patients with statin intolerance. For patients who cannot tolerate a statin using the above strategies, alternate agents alone or in combination may be considered; innovative approaches to research on statin intolerance are needed.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^f022119d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

LOW-RISK DRUG ALLERGY LABELS

Immune-mediated reactions to drugs most commonly manifest with cutaneous symptoms, although any organ can be affected. These skin manifestations are frequently benign and self-resolving generalized maculopapular exanthems or morbilliform drug eruptions. For delayed onset drug hypersensitivity reactions, early studies suggested a prevalence of 2% for cutaneous drug eruptions, with up to 90% of these being mild. Drug-induced urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis have been described as immediate drug hypersensitivity mediated by IgE or non-IgE mechanisms. However, even confirmed true IgE-mediated reactions could be transient and lost over time, as described for penicillin and cephalosporin allergies. In the pediatric population, there is an increased prevalence of viral-induced reactions compared with true drug hypersensitivity. In this context, when children develop a morbilliform drug eruption or serum sickness — like reaction, this is uncommonly positive on rechallenge and assumed to have occurred as part of a viral infection or viral drug interaction. When the drug allergy is not verified in childhood, this label can be carried to the adult age.

The drug allergy history is a key aspect of a drug allergy evaluation. This allows the clinician to differentiate between a side effect and an immune-mediated reaction. Patient-reported allergy history, in conjunction with health record review, has facilitated clinical risk stratification and guided allergy diagnostic procedures and recommendations across clinical care settings for decades. – More recently, the drug allergy history has been used to distinguish which patients may not need comprehensive allergy diagnostic testing. For example, in the context of penicillin allergy, clinical interviews, in the absence of skin testing, can assist in identifying very low-risk allergy phenotypes. Skin testing includes skin prick and intradermal testing (IDT), usually performed by allergists/immunologists or those with specialized training. Like any test with a low pretest probability, skin testing can lead to false positive results, which should be avoided in a low-risk population. A drug ingestion challenge remains the gold standard test to ensure that a patient can be successfully "delabeled". Various health care professionals can safely perform low-risk drug challenges with consensus-driven or empirically derived low-risk definitions and adequate training and resources. When an allergy entry is removed, deleted, or inactivated from the EHR, it is termed delabeling.

### Anaphylaxis: past, present and future [^15139ed9]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and recent reports suggest increased prevalence. A diverse set of primary genetic and environmental influences may confer susceptibility to anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. It often manifests with a broad array of symptoms and signs that might be similar to other diseases. The management of anaphylaxis consists of emergency treatment of acute episodes as well as preventive strategies to avoid recurrences. Treatment is complicated by its rapid onset and progression, presence of concurrent diseases or medications, and need for long-term allergen avoidance. Health care professionals must be able to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis, treat an episode promptly and appropriately, and provide preventive recommendations. Recognizing the gaps in our understanding and management of anaphylaxis may help identify promising targets for future treatment and prevention and areas that require further study.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^144824fd]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The main strength of our analyses is that they provide the first reliable estimates of the causal contribution of statins to muscle symptoms reported by a wide range of patients. The data are derived from large-scale, double-blind, randomised trials, which guarantees the avoidance of both moderate random errors and moderate biases. By contrast, non-randomised observational studies, in which outcomes are compared between individuals who received the treatment of interest and those who did not are (irrespective of their size) prone to moderate biases (especially where participants are aware of which drugs they are taking), which cannot be guaranteed to be removed through statistical adjustment (eg, propensity score matching).

However, there are some potential limitations to our analyses. Firstly, there was considerable heterogeneity in the methods used for the ascertainment of muscle symptoms, and definitions varied from trial to trial. Nonetheless, as noted above, the relative excesses appeared to be broadly consistent among the different trials and clinical circumstances. Secondly, although we sought adverse event data from all randomised, double-blind trials included in the CTT, some data were not available. However, the missing data represented less than 1% of all adverse events,(mainly because of data privacy concerns). Furthermore, data were not consistently available on whether muscle events led to the discontinuation of allocated treatment (and thus planned on-treatment analyses for rare events were not possible), and there was no reliable information on some relevant comorbid conditions (such as hypothyroidism) or concomitant medications that might affect the risk of having symptoms. Thirdly, most reports of muscle pain or weakness were not accompanied by a measurement of creatine kinase value, so we were unable to assess whether some symptoms were associated with large increases in creatine kinase concentrations. However, among the cases for which there were data available on creatine kinase concentrations, more than 96% were less than 3 times the ULN, and there was no evidence that (after removing myopathy cases) extreme creatine kinase values were more common among participants allocated to the statin groups. Finally, although all trials excluded anyone known to have had a previous serious adverse reaction to statin therapy, and many took steps to exclude those with a previous statin sensitivity or hypersensitivity, most of them did not seek to identify or exclude participants who might now be categorised as statin intolerant (most of the trials had completed enrolment before statins were in common use and well before they were available generically).

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms-managing the highly intolerant [^e7710497]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with statin therapy. Yet, certain data indicate that these symptoms often present in populations with underlying musculoskeletal complaints and are not likely statin related. Switching statins or using lower doses resolves muscle complaints in most patients. However, there is a growing population of individuals who experience intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms with multiple statins, regardless of the individual agent or prescribed dose. Recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials enrolling highly intolerant subjects provide significant insight regarding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Notable findings include the inconsistency with reproducing muscle complaints, as approximately 40% of subjects report SAMS when taking a statin but not while receiving placebo, but a substantial cohort reports intolerable muscle symptoms with placebo but none when on a statin. These data validate SAMS for those likely experiencing true intolerance, but for others, suggest a psychosomatic component or misattribution of the source of pain and highlights the importance of differentiating from the musculoskeletal symptoms caused by concomitant factors. Managing the highly intolerant requires candid patient counseling, shared decision-making, eliminating contributing factors, careful clinical assessment and the use of a myalgia index score, and isolating potential muscle-related adverse events by gradually reintroducing drug therapy with the utilization of intermittent dosing of lipid-altering agents. We provide a review of recent data and therapeutic guidance involving a focused step-by-step approach for managing SAMS among the highly intolerant. Such strategies usually allow for clinically meaningful reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an overall lowering of cardiovascular risk.

### Side effect patterns in a crossover trial of statin, placebo, and No treatment [^041a51f5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Were the participants really intolerant of statin tablets?

Superficially, it may appear that the trial has failed to recruit participants with true intolerance. However, it should be remembered that they had self-reported intolerance based on experience solely with statin tablets, ie, no access to blinded matched placebo. The trial confirmed clear (P < 0.0001) intolerance of statin tablets: the main surprise was an equally clear intolerance of placebo tablets (P < 0.0001), in a population who had been advised during the informed consent process that they would be receiving statin, placebo, and no-tablet periods. The intolerance was severe: 26 of 60 had to stop a statin month early. However, 23 of 60 had to stop a placebo month early. It is clear that this cohort were indeed intolerant of statin tablets, but also that the source of the intolerance was primarily the tablet, not the statin.

The need for a planned schedule and symptom tracking

Because SAMSON was an exercise in personalized medicine, each participant's full daily data are shown in the Supplemental Appendix, and they reveal several patterns. Figure 2 shows 6 exemplar patients whose symptom scores we will now cover in more detail. Some participants (eg, participant 53) essentially experienced no side effects during the trial, despite intolerable side effects with statins previously. Others (eg, participant 10) had intense symptoms throughout, regardless of whether they were taking tablets or not.

These 2 patterns represent situations where symptoms not caused by taking statins have been previously attributed to them. In participant 53, these symptoms were presumably an intercurrent phenomenon and have now disappeared. In participant 10, they are "ever-present" and not exacerbated by statins.

For a patient to discover this for themselves requires a formal schedule with systematic symptom tracking, otherwise they might stop tablets only when they have bad symptoms (and can only get better), and restart them only when they feel well (and can only get worse). This inevitably leads them to believe that stopping the tablets alleviated the symptoms, and restarting exacerbated them.

The need for a placebo

The third pattern was statin and placebo inducing similar symptoms (eg, participant 45). These symptoms are genuine, but are caused by the nocebo effect, rather than the statin. Patients and clinicians do not have access to matched placebo in clinical practice. Unfortunately, therefore, even with a careful protocol and meticulous documentation, they will misattribute this nocebo effect as evidence of statin intolerance.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^c0070561]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drug in the Western world. Their use is predicted to rise further due to recent reductions in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription across the globe. However, cardiovascular benefits of statins are restricted by adverse effects that limit adherence, and, in turn, increase cardiovascular eventsand mortality. The most common side effects and main reason for discontinuation of therapy emerge from skeletal muscle (statin myopathy or statin-associated adverse muscle symptoms). Although no strict definition of statin myopathy has been universally adopted, we use this term to encompass the full spectrum of the effects of statins on skeletal muscle. This includes mild to moderate muscle symptoms and/or signs (myalgia: muscle pain with stiffness and weakness), as well as more severe potentially life-threatening outcomes (myositis and/or rhabdomyolysis) that are associated with raised creatine kinase. Although physical activity counteracts metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in subjects prescribed statins, exercise has been reported to exacerbate statin myopathy, which may further limit the benefits of statins in those at risk of cardiovascular disease.

Study limitations

The principal limitation of SAMSON is that it only recruited participants with symptoms that arose within 2 weeks of commencing statins. This allowed a trial duration that would be acceptable to most potential participants. To allow many periods of statin, placebo, and no tablets, we made each period 1 month long. To give enough time for symptoms to manifest, we therefore only enrolled participants whose symptoms characteristically arose within 2 weeks. SAMSON only tested a single statin at a single dose. We chose atorvastatin 20 mg daily because this is an inexpensive off-patent agent with satisfactory efficacy data, and is guideline-recommended for primary prevention. Finally, SAMSON did not require blood samples to avoid discouraging participation, to prevent delays to stopping tablets, and to maximize clinical applicability.

Future research should address why statins show such a high nocebo effect. One possibility is the dual misfortune of statins commonly being started for primary prevention where there are no symptoms to improve in an age group wherein ill-defined discomfort becomes increasingly common. Florid reports by mass media, unfiltered by scientific discipline, may lead to a vicious cycle where increased vigilance causes increased prevalence and vice versa. Induction of physical symptoms through information is recognized in medicine. The fact that atorvastatin is now the most prescribed medication has led to the following: 1) there are more patients to make an initial report of symptoms; 2) the media have a greater interest in publicizing them; and 3) individuals have a higher probability of being on the drug and having their attention drawn to symptoms. This triple combination might explain the dramatically higher public perception of side effects with statin tablets than with other medications.

### Assessment of pharmacogenetic tests: presenting measures of clinical validity and potential population impact in association studies [^cefbaecf]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2017). Low credibility.

A previous study has suggested that the strength of the association can be used as a single indicator of the diagnostic test performancebecause low ORs will never result in highly predictive diagnostic tests. This is true, but not sufficient. Clinical validity depends on the OR but the OR alone does not determine clinical validity and impact. We showed that the impact of the frequencies of the variant and the adverse event on clinical validity and population impact cannot be inferred from the strength of the association alone. Knowledge about the frequencies of the genetic variant and the adverse event in the target population and their influence on clinical validity and potential population impact can aid in identifying groups with increased or decreased drug efficacy or adverse event risks or aid in the selection of subpopulations that should be genotyped with priority.

The OR and the frequencies of the genetic variant and adverse event determine the clinical validity, but whether the clinical validity is high enough for the pharmacogenetic test to have clinical utility is determined by the intended use. The clinical utility of a genetic test is the ability of the test to prevent or ameliorate adverse health outcomes. Whether a test is worth implementing is a tradeoff of the benefits and costs that accrue from both positive and negative test results. For example, for the prevention of life-threatening adverse events, such as abacavir hypersensitivity, lower specificity may be acceptable to obtain the high sensitivity that is needed to prevent the vast majority of adverse events. However, for the prevention of milder adverse events, such as myalgia that often occurs during simvastatin therapy, a lower specificity may not outweigh the higher cost that come with targeting drug therapy. The potential implementation of a pharmacogenetic test is also determined by the alterative treatments available. If there were no alternative treatments to replace abacavir, the benefits of therapy could be considered to outweigh the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.

### Side effect patterns in a crossover trial of statin, placebo, and No treatment [^ae2e16c8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Danger of current practice of informal experiments

Prompt onset and offset of symptoms after starting and stopping tablets is often interpreted by patients and clinicians as evidence of causation. Our data indicate that this is true, but because the kinetics are identical between placebo tablets and statin tablets (Figures 3 and 4), the causation is from taking a tablet, rather than from the tablet being a statin.

The danger of the informal experimentation that is currently recommended in North America, Europe, and the United Kingdom is that even if there is a preplanned schedule and daily symptom scoring, without a placebo it is inevitable that nocebo symptoms will be misattributed to the statin. This phenomenon would unfortunately contribute to the 50% of statin starters who stop.

Just as unfortunate current clinical practice might entrain a nocebo response, experience of multiple crossovers with no-tablet periods might be helpful to reverse the process, desensitizing patients to this nocebo effect.

Study implications

The 3-arm multiple-crossover design (including no-tablet and placebo periods) allows individualized verification of the existence of side effects of statin tablets, and exploration of the contributions of taking a tablet vs the tablet being a statin. The results have important implications for patients and physicians when symptoms are experienced on statin tablets in routine clinical practice.

The first practical implication is that even severe, convincing, and intolerable symptoms in clinical practice sometimes do not reappear on formal evaluation with daily documentation. This occurred in participants 11 and 53, who had each previously abandoned 2 different statin regimens (Figure 2).

Second, formal documentation of symptom scores sometimes reveals the culprit to be background fluctuations in symptom intensity, regardless of tablets (eg, participants 10 and 60) (Figure 2).

Third, there are verifiable side effects of statin tablets. However, these were similar in intensity between statin and placebo, which means that even reproducible induction of symptoms by statin tablets provides no information about whether the cause is the tablet or the statin component.

Finally, it is wrong to interpret rapid symptom decline after stopping tablets as evidence that the statin was the cause, because the decline is similarly rapid and profound for both statin and placebo.

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^50f4dcd5]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Interpretation and future research

The analysis of our series of n-of-1 trials found no overall effect of statins on muscle symptoms in participants selected on the basis of having experienced severe muscle symptoms but no important increases in levels of enzymes during previous treatment with statins. The lack of effect in patients completing the trial, combined with the low number of withdrawals owing to muscle symptoms, suggests a nocebo effect among users of statins, or of high tolerance to blinded rechallenge.

Treatment with statins for those at high risk has potential health benefits that are lost by those who stop treatment. The availability of n-of-1 trial packs in clinical care would allow patients and clinician to replicate this study in individuals, for any statin and at any dose to suit clinical needs, in primary care or in lipid clinics. Our results suggest that most patients would restart treatment after such a trial. Future work could focus on conducting n-of-1 trials for other types of statins and higher doses, and for other drugs which are associated with transient adverse effects.

Table 6 — NLA clinical perspective on real-world SAMS frequencies — Total SAMS is estimated at 10% (frequency range 5% to 25%). Pharmacologic SAMS is estimated at 1–2% (frequency range 0.5% to 4%), and N-of-1 trials suggest downward adjustment from 4–5%. The table comments that SAMS frequency may have increased from earliest estimates due to nocebo effect, with PRIMO and USAGE cited as best estimates.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^d3d3099c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statin-based approaches.

Since statins are the only agents with a robust body of evidence proving reduction in clinical end points, every effort should be made to keep high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen.

Switching statins may be efficacious. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who received another statin after an episode of statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without recurrent symptoms. Considering the results of the PRIMO study, the use of statins associated with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, may be considered, although these statins may not be potent enough if a large reduction of LDL cholesterol is needed to reach target values. In one study, 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily (as a slow-release preparation) was tolerated in 97% of patients with prior statin intolerance owing to muscle-related symptoms, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 32.8%.

Another approach evaluated in several studies involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, in low doses or at a reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For example, in a retrospective analysis of 51 patients with a statin, alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated in 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

### Statin intolerance [^774732aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The term statin intolerance refers to an inability to use statins because of muscle symptoms or elevated creatine kinase, and the major diagnostic challenge is to unambiguously link these to statin use. Roughly 5% to 10% of statin users develop statin intolerance, and because statin use is expected to increase — especially after recent updated guidelines have expanded the statin benefit groups — adverse effects from statins will become a growing issue. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology — and even the terminology — of statin-related muscle injury lacks clarity. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, family history of myopathy and statin dose; many cases manifest only after patients are administered an interacting medication (e.g., azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and cyclosporine). The diagnosis of myopathy remains challenging, especially because some patients can have normal serum creatine kinase levels despite demonstrable weakness and muscle biopsy-proven statin-induced myopathy. A statin withdrawal and rechallenge helps patients distinguish whether their myalgia symptoms are because of statins, but, in at least 1 clinical trial, even 5% of placebo-treated patients developed myalgias during a controlled withdrawal and rechallenge. No consensus exists for management of patients with statin intolerance. Many patients can eventually tolerate a statin but often at suboptimal doses. A subset of patients do well with nondaily regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing. Some patients cannot tolerate statins at all, requiring nonstatin lipid-lowering medications — the benefit of which remains unclear with regard to preventing atherosclerotic events. Ultimately, statin intolerance undermines the drug adherence that is critical for achieving the benefits of lifelong lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, statin myopathy is a common challenge in lipid management, and further work is needed to establish a standard diagnostic criterion as well as treatment algorithms.

### A new case of allergic contact dermatitis to topical simvastatin used for treatment of porokeratosis [^b1a8c32a]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Eczematous rash with erythematous, squamous and crusty lesions on the right lower limb after applying a cream containing simvastatin 2% and cholesterol 2%.

Patch tests were conducted on the upper back using IQ Ultra chambers (Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Vellinge, Sweden) occluded for 2 days with Opertape (Iberhospitex, Innovative Health Technologies, Barcelona, Spain). The European baseline series was tested along with additional haptens recommended by the REVIDAL‐GERDA network (Réseau de Vigilance en Dermato‐Allergologie du Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche en Dermato‐Allergologie), 1% simvastatin in petrolatum (pet.) and 1% cholesterol in pet. from our hospital pharmacy. The patient's personal products (both preparations containing simvastatin and cholesterol) were tested 'as is' along with some of the ingredients from the second preparation such as propylene glycol 30% in water (aq.), pentylene glycol 10%aq. chlorphenesin 0,3% aq. and cetyl alcohol 5% in pet. The haptens were supplied by Chemotechnique Diagnostics except for pentylene glycol (Dipta, Aix‐en‐Provence, France) and chlorphenesin (provided by a cosmetic manufacturer). Patch tests were read on days 2 (D2) and 4 (D4) according to the ESCD recommendations.

All tests were negative except for simvastatin 1%pet. + on D2 and ++ on D4, and both preparations containing simvastatin ++ on D2 and D4, resulting in a final diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis to topical simvastatin (Figure 2). Five controls tested with simvastatin 1% pet showed negative results.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids [^0270fa34]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids (CS) are rare in the general population, but they are not uncommon in high-risk groups such as patients who receive repeated doses of CS. Hypersensitivity reactions to steroids are broadly divided into two categories: immediate reactions, typically occurring within 1 h of drug administration, and non-immediate reactions, which manifest more than an hour after drug administration. The latter group is more common. We reviewed the literature using the search terms "hypersensitivity to steroids, adverse effects of steroids, steroid allergy, allergic contact dermatitis, corticosteroid side effects, and type I hypersensitivity" to identify studies or clinical reports of steroid hypersensitivity. We discuss the prevalence, mechanism, presentation, evaluation, and therapeutic options in corticosteroid hypersensitivity reactions. There is a paucity of literature on corticosteroid allergy, with most reports being case reports. Most reports involve non-systemic application of corticosteroids. Steroid hypersensitivity has been associated with type I IgE-mediated allergy including anaphylaxis. The overall prevalence of type I steroid hypersensitivity is estimated to be 0.3–0.5%. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is the most commonly reported non-immediate hypersensitivity reaction and usually follows topical CS application. Atopic dermatitis and stasis dermatitis of the lower extremities are risk factors for the development of ACD from topical CS. Patients can also develop hypersensitivity reactions to nasal, inhaled, oral, and parenteral CS. A close and detailed evaluation is required for the clinician to confirm the presence of a true hypersensitivity reaction to the suspected drug and choose the safest alternative. Choosing an alternative CS is not only paramount to the patient's safety but also ameliorates the worry of developing an allergic, and potentially fatal, steroid hypersensitivity reaction. This evaluation becomes especially important in high-risk groups where steroids are a life-saving treatment. The assessment should be done when the patient's underlying condition is in a quiescent state.

Macrolide allergy — diagnosis is best established by direct challenge in nonanaphylactic histories: Even though macrolides are commonly listed in allergy records, very few patients are confirmed allergic, the utility of immediate-type skin testing using nonirritating concentrations is uncertain, and therefore direct challenge appears to be the most appropriate diagnostic approach for patients with a history of nonanaphylactic reactions.

### Prevalence of contact allergy to corticosteroids in a Danish patient population [^85153ace]. Contact Dermatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Design and study population

This study was a retrospective study of all patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis patch tested between January, 2006, and December, 2020, performed consecutively at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy Centre, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.

Data on patch test results, information about the relevance of the positive patch test reactions (current, past or unknown) and study population characteristics by the internationally accepted MOAHLFA index (acronym for: M = Male, O = Occupational dermatitis, A = Atopic dermatitis [current or previous], H = Hand dermatitis, L = Leg dermatitis, F = Facial dermatitis, A = Age > 40 years) method, were retrieved from the Allergen database, Odense University Hospital (journal no. 21/14482). The corticosteroid patch test data were stratified by test year, sex and age group. If patients were patch tested more than once in the test period, solely the last patch test result was included for further analysis.

2.2 Patch testing

The patch testing was routinely performed with standard series of commercial allergens embodying the TRUE Test (SmartPractice A/S)with tixocortol‐21‐pivalate, budesonide and hydrocortisone‐17‐butyrate.

The patch tests were applied on the upper backs of patients for 2 days and routinely read on D3 or D4, and D7. The reactions on the readings were categorized as: negative (−), irritant reaction (IR), doubtful (+?), positive (+, ++ or +++), by the clinician, according to the recommendations of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG). Patch reactions categorized as −, IR and +? were registered as non‐allergic responses.

Clinical relevance was subsequently assessed by a dermatologist according to exposure history and dermatitis pattern. The positive reactions were categorized into current, past or unknown relevance. Cases without registration of relevance were categorized as 'unknown relevance'.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^e0055bf1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Approaches to statin-associated side effects (SASEs) — Because the overwhelming body of evidence for ASCVD risk reduction with lipid-lowering therapies is from statin randomized controlled trials, evidence-based statin therapy of appropriate intensity is recommended as first-line therapy in all 4 patient management groups. After initiation, some individuals may experience unacceptable adverse effects, the most commonly reported being muscle-related symptoms. The incidence of statin intolerance is relatively low in large RCTs, and evidence from the SAMSON and ASCOT-LLA trials demonstrates that the majority of symptoms may be related to a "nocebo" effect. An algorithm for management of patients with SASEs in each of the patient management groups is provided in this update.
