## Question

Levofloxacin dosing in crrt patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about levofloxacin dosing in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin and how CRRT alters clearance. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says for CRRT and reconcile that with pharmacokinetic studies. Next, I will consider CRRT operational parameters that influence drug removal and the risk of under- versus overdosing. After that, I should integrate severity of illness, residual renal function, and infection site/MIC into dosing decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and highlight safety monitoring and uncertainties that warrant caution.

> Let me first confirm the drug's PK basics and CRRT effects. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with moderate protein binding and predominantly renal elimination; its clearance falls as creatinine clearance declines, and the half-life lengthens in renal impairment, which is why dose reductions are standard in CKD [^26632da1] [^8c71b39b]. CRRT can add extracorporeal clearance via convection and diffusion, and for small, moderately protein-bound agents like levofloxacin, CRRT can meaningfully increase total clearance, sometimes approximating 20–30 mL/min depending on effluent flow and modality, which complicates simple "anuric" dosing assumptions [^076bff1d] [^42655f6d].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA position on CRRT dosing. The FDA labeling for IV levofloxacin advises reducing the dose in CRRT: start at 500 mg, then use a maximal dose of 250 mg every 24 hours, which implies a 50% dose reduction from standard dosing in normal renal function [^5ae90c29]. Hold on, I should double-check the oral label; yes, the oral label similarly recommends 500 mg once, then 250 mg daily in CRRT, aligning with the IV guidance [^04a066c4]. I initially thought the FDA might say "no adjustment", but that would be incorrect for systemic levofloxacin in CRRT; the correct interpretation is that a dose reduction is advised, not no change [^5ae90c29] [^04a066c4].

> Next, I should review direct PK data in CRRT to see if the FDA's conservative stance matches observed clearance. In a CVVH study of anuric patients, levofloxacin had a mean sieving coefficient near 1.0 and mean hemofiltration clearance around 21 mL/min, with total clearance averaging about 47 mL/min; importantly, a 500 mg loading dose followed by 250 mg daily achieved steady-state troughs near 2.9 mg/L without accumulation, supporting the 500→250 mg regimen in anuric CRRT [^076bff1d]. Let me consider whether higher effluent flows change this; although most PK studies did not isolate levofloxacin at multiple effluent intensities, extracorporeal clearance generally scales with effluent flow, so higher flows (e.g., 35–40 mL/kg/h) could increase removal and justify cautious upward adjustments in select cases, though data are limited and heterogeneous [^c67c3709] [^2f039ed6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to balance underdosing risk against toxicity. Critically ill patients often have increased volume of distribution and altered protein binding, and early underexposure to fluoroquinolones can impair bacterial killing, particularly for organisms with higher MICs or in sites with lower drug penetration; conversely, accumulation can increase risks like QT prolongation and neurotoxicity, especially in older adults or those with predisposing conditions [^25bfc33d] [^9cbd87d1]. I should confirm that fluoroquinolone dose-related adverse events are more frequent in advanced CKD; indeed, higher-dose fluoroquinolones in older adults with eGFR < 30 mL/min are associated with more nervous system and psychiatric events, reinforcing the need to avoid excessive dosing in reduced GFR contexts [^b1f52da2] [^8f39ce94].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most adult patients with anuria on CRRT, a 500 mg IV or oral loading dose followed by 250 mg every 24 hours is reasonable and consistent with FDA labeling and CVVH PK data; this balances early exposure with avoidance of accumulation [^5ae90c29] [^076bff1d]. But wait, what if the effluent dose is high (e.g., 35–40 mL/kg/h) and the pathogen has an MIC near the susceptibility breakpoint, or the infection site has lower exposure (e.g. CNS, lung)? In those scenarios, I would consider maintaining 500 mg daily for the first 1–2 days with close monitoring for toxicity, then de-escalate to 250 mg daily if drug exposure is adequate and the patient stabilizes; this aligns with principles of early aggressive dosing in critical illness followed by de-escalation once PK/PD targets are likely met [^0603714d] [^5bac809f]. I should confirm that residual renal function is minimal; if there is meaningful urine output or recovering native function, total clearance may be higher, arguing for standard 500 mg dosing rather than a reduced maintenance dose, with reassessment as renal function changes [^6a8a0b41].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center. Monitor for CNS effects, seizures, and QT prolongation, especially in older adults or with interacting drugs; check electrolytes and ECG when risk factors are present, and avoid coadministration with other QT-prolonging agents when possible [^9cbd87d1]. Let me reconsider whether therapeutic drug monitoring helps; while TDM for levofloxacin is not routinely available in many centers, clinical response and toxicity surveillance should guide dose adjustments, and if available, troughs around 2–4 mg/L can be reasonable targets for many pathogens, recognizing that PK/PD goals vary with MIC and site of infection [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special situations. For ophthalmic levofloxacin, the FDA indicates no dose adjustment in CRRT, which makes sense given minimal systemic absorption; this does not apply to systemic therapy decisions [^7433c8bb]. For peritoneal dialysis or intermittent hemodialysis, the FDA recommends dose reductions similar to advanced CKD, and importantly, it notes that neither HD nor CAPD effectively removes levofloxacin, so no supplemental doses are needed after dialysis; this supports the concept that CRRT, which is continuous, is more likely to contribute to clearance and thus warrants the CRRT-specific reduction outlined above [^0ca9270e] [^9cbd87d1].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and advocate for individualized care. CRRT modalities, membrane characteristics, and delivered effluent vary widely, and patient-specific factors like fluid overload, albumin, and residual renal function further modify exposure; therefore, reassess renal function and clinical response daily, and adjust dosing as kidney recovery or CRRT intensity changes [^0603714d] [^25bfc33d]. If the clinical trajectory is not as expected, consider early escalation or de-escalation and, where feasible, engage infectious diseases or clinical pharmacology for PK/PD optimization in complex cases [^0603714d].

---

In CRRT, levofloxacin requires **dose reduction** because CRRT increases drug clearance [^076bff1d]. The recommended regimen is a **500 mg loading dose**, then **250 mg every 24 hours** for both IV and oral routes [^5ae90c29] [^04a066c4]. This balances the risk of underdosing in critical illness with the need to avoid accumulation from reduced renal clearance [^0603714d]. Adjust dosing if CRRT intensity changes or if residual renal function fluctuates, and monitor for efficacy and toxicity [^c67c3709] [^25bfc33d].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in CRRT

CRRT alters levofloxacin pharmacokinetics by increasing clearance through continuous filtration and dialysis, which can lead to **subtherapeutic levels** if standard doses are used [^076bff1d]. Levofloxacin is moderately protein-bound (~24–38%) and primarily renally cleared, making it susceptible to removal by CRRT [^076bff1d].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose adjustment

Limited direct data inform levofloxacin dosing in CRRT; however, a pharmacokinetic study in critically ill patients receiving CVVH found that a **500 mg loading dose followed by 250 mg daily** achieved therapeutic concentrations without accumulation [^076bff1d]. This regimen is now reflected in FDA labeling for CRRT [^5ae90c29] [^04a066c4].

---

## Current dosing recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Initial dose | 500 mg IV or PO once (loading dose) |
| Maintenance dose | 250 mg IV or PO every 24 hours |

---

These recommendations apply to **adult patients receiving CRRT** with typical effluent flows of 20–25 mL/kg/h [^c1b1d3cb]. Adjustments may be needed if CRRT intensity or residual renal function changes [^c67c3709].

---

## Factors influencing dosing adjustments

Several factors influence **levofloxacin dosing in CRRT**:

- **CRRT modality and intensity**: Higher effluent flows (e.g. 35–40 mL/kg/h) increase drug clearance and may necessitate higher doses, though data are limited [^c67c3709].
- **Residual renal function**: Significant urine output can increase clearance, potentially requiring dose adjustment [^6a8a0b41].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, body weight, and severity of illness can affect pharmacokinetics and may warrant individualized dosing [^25bfc33d].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety considerations

Balancing efficacy and safety is critical: underdosing risks treatment failure and resistance, whereas overdosing increases toxicity, including **QT prolongation** and **CNS effects** [^b1f52da2]. The 500 mg loading dose followed by 250 mg daily achieves therapeutic levels while minimizing accumulation in CRRT [^076bff1d].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

Given pharmacokinetic variability, **monitor clinical response** and adjust dosing as needed:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Assess infection markers, clinical status, and signs of toxicity.
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Not routinely available for levofloxacin, but consider if available to guide dosing in complex cases [^2a0376be].
- **Adjustments**: Modify dosing if CRRT intensity or residual renal function changes significantly [^c67c3709].

---

## Comparison with other fluoroquinolones

Among fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin is more extensively cleared by CRRT than moxifloxacin (which is hepatically cleared), necessitating **greater dose reduction** in CRRT. Ciprofloxacin, another renally cleared fluoroquinolone, also requires dose adjustment in CRRT, though specific recommendations differ [^1e6b7f30].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Loading dose**: 500 mg IV or PO once.
- **Maintenance dose**: 250 mg IV or PO every 24 hours.
- **Adjustments**: Modify based on CRRT intensity, residual renal function, and clinical response [^0603714d].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for efficacy and toxicity, and adjust as needed [^25bfc33d].

---

Levofloxacin dosing in CRRT should be **reduced to 500 mg loading then 250 mg daily** to account for increased clearance and avoid accumulation. Individualize dosing based on CRRT parameters, residual renal function, and clinical response, with vigilant monitoring for efficacy and toxicity [^5ae90c29] [^076bff1d].

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill adult patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^4252ca0c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is now commonly used as a means of support for critically ill patients with renal failure. No recent comprehensive guidelines exist that provide antibiotic dosing recommendations for adult patients receiving CRRT. Doses used in intermittent hemodialysis cannot be directly applied to these patients, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are different than those in patients with normal renal function. We reviewed the literature for studies involving the following antibiotics frequently used to treat critically ill adult patients receiving CRRT: vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, nafcillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, colistin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B (deoxycholate and lipid formulations), and acyclovir. We used these data, as well as clinical experience, to make recommendations for antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

Objectives

To outline the concepts involved in optimizing antibacterial dosing in critically ill patients with acute renal failure undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), provide a strategy for optimizing dosing, and summarize the data required to implement the strategy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search from February 1986 to 2008.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Optimal dosing of antibacterials is dependent on achieving pharmacokinetic targets associated with maximal killing of bacteria and improved outcomes. The initial dose is dependent on the volume of distribution. Maintenance doses are dependent on clearance. Both should be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic target associated with optimal bacterial killing, when known. The volume of distribution of some antibacterials is altered by critical illness or acute renal failure or both. Clearance by CRRT is dependent on the dose and mode of CRRT and the sieving or saturation coefficient of the drug. Both sieving and saturation coefficient are related to the plasma protein binding and thus may be altered in renal failure.

Conclusions

Appropriate dose calculation requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic target and the usual minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected organism in the patient's locality (or if unavailable, the break point for the organism), published pharmacokinetic data (volume of distribution, non-CRRT clearance) on critically ill patients receiving CRRT (which may differ substantially from noncritically ill patients or those without renal failure), the sieving or saturation coefficient of the relevant drug in critically ill patients, the dose and mode of CRRT being used, and the actual dose of CRRT that is delivered. This large number of variables results in considerable inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity in dose requirements. This article provides basic principles and relevant data to guide the clinician in prescribing individualized dosing regimes.

Antibiotic dosing during renal replacement therapy

Early and adequate antibiotic therapy is crucial in critically ill patients with signs and symptoms of infection. AKI alters antibiotic elimination, leading to drug accumulation, and the use of CRRT may further modify antibiotic pharmacokinetics. However, current recommendations on antibiotic dosing during CRRT are based on studies that included a limited number of patients, that had varying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and that included patients who received different types of RRT. Effluent flow rate was the most reliable predictor of antibiotic clearance in critically ill patients, and higher dosing regimens may be required in critically ill patients receiving RRT, in particular for poorly susceptible strains. Nevertheless, this strategy may also be associated with very high drug levels in the late phase of therapy, with the potential development of drug-related side effects. When possible, therefore, antibiotic concentrations should be measured in patients undergoing CRRT and dosing schedules adapted to the individual patient.

### We underdose antibiotics in patients on CRRT [^5bac809f]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Appropriate antibiotic dosing in critically ill, infected, patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is crucial to improve patient outcomes. Severe sepsis and septic shock result in changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, including increased volume of distribution, hypoalbuminemia, and changes in renal and nonrenal clearances. The lack of CRRT standardization, nonrecognition of how CRRT variability affects antibiotic removal, fear of antibiotic toxicity, and limited drug dosing resources all contribute to suboptimal antibiotic therapy. Even when antibiotic CRRT pharmacokinetic studies are available, they are often based on old CRRT methodologies that do not exist in contemporary CRRT practice, resulting in unhelpful/inaccurate dosing recommendations. Application of these older doses in Monte Carlo simulation studies reveals that many of the recommended dosing regimens will never attain pharmacodynamic targets. In this review, using cefepime as an example, we illustrate whether clinicians are likely to achieve pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets when the recommended dosing regimens are prescribed in this patient population. We encourage clinicians to aggressively dose antibiotics with large loading dose and higher maintenance doses to reach the targets.

### Β-lactam antibiotic concentrations during continuous renal replacement therapy [^85e0025b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The use of standard doses of β-lactam antibiotics during CRRT may result in inadequate serum concentrations to treat less susceptible Gram-negative strains, such as P. aeruginosa.

- During CRRT, the administration of drug regimens similar to those patients with normal renal function reduced the proportion of inadequate serum concentrations to 10%.

- Nevertheless, 53% of samples were associated with very high drug levels and daily drug regimens may need to be adapted accordingly to avoid adverse events.

### Lack of drug dosing guidelines for critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^61a4c188]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is common, costly, and associated with mortality rates of up to 60%. Accurate pharmacokinetic data are essential to developing rational individualized dosing strategies and providing optimal care to these patients, yet few such data exist, probably due in part to an absence of regulatory guidance on the issue. The Kidney Health Initiative is working with stakeholders to propose strategies to address this in a standardized manner.

### Antibiotic dosing for critically ill adult patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy: an update [^0603714d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To summarize current antibiotic dosing recommendations in critically ill patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT), and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), including considerations for individualizing therapy. Data Sources: A literature search of PubMed from January 2008 to May 2019 was performed to identify English-language literature in which dosing recommendations were proposed for antibiotics commonly used in critically ill patients receiving IHD, PIRRT, or CRRT. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All pertinent reviews, selected studies, and references were evaluated to ensure appropriateness for inclusion. Data Synthesis: Updated empirical dosing considerations are proposed for antibiotics in critically ill patients receiving IHD, PIRRT, and CRRT with recommendations for individualizing therapy. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review defines principles for assessing renal function, identifies RRT system properties affecting drug clearance and drug properties affecting clearance during RRT, outlines pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic dosing considerations, reviews pertinent updates in the literature, develops updated empirical dosing recommendations, and highlights important factors for individualizing therapy in critically ill patients. Conclusions: Appropriate antimicrobial selection and dosing are vital to improve clinical outcomes. Dosing recommendations should be applied cautiously with efforts to consider local epidemiology and resistance patterns, antibiotic dosing and infusion strategies, renal replacement modalities, patient-specific considerations, severity of illness, residual renal function, comorbidities, and patient response to therapy. Recommendations provided herein are intended to serve as a guide in developing and revising therapy plans individualized to meet a patient's needs.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: how can we optimize therapy? [^ce472a82]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

This commentary discusses the findings of Beumier and colleagues about beta-lactam concentrations during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). In recent years, pharmacokinetics (PK) of antibiotics in critically ill patients has been studied intensely. Standard antibiotic dosing apparently results in highly variable antibiotic concentrations in the blood and tissues. A recent multicenter point prevalence study found that 20% of the patients are underdosed (when aiming for the most conservative target) and could link antibiotic underexposure to worse clinical outcome. The causes for the variability in effective antibiotic concentration are multiple, but increased volume of distribution and enhanced elimination from the circulation, mostly via the kidneys in patients suffering from augmented renal clearance, are the most important contributors.

But also when the kidneys fail, antibiotic dosing can be challenging. When kidney function deteriorates, standard dosing may lead to accumulation of a drug and therefore antibiotic doses are often adapted to the kidney function. Also, when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is indicated, antibiotic doses are often decreased.

Dosing during extracorporeal therapies

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be delivered by diffusion (hemodialysis), convection (hemofiltration), or a combination of both (hemodiafiltration). It may be delivered continuously (CRRT) or intermittently. There are several papers on drug dosing during CRRT, but very few in critically ill patients receiving intermittent RRT. A specific issue for intermittent RRT is the inconsistent drug clearance likely to occur during a 24-hour period. Such inconsistent clearance is highly problematic for time-dependent antibiotics where unadjusted dosing in the presence of high drug clearance that alternates with no drug clearance will result in potentially very low and very high concentrations over the course of the day exposing the patient to risks of clinical failure and toxicity.

Drugs that are hydrophilic and usually subject to renal clearance are commonly cleared by dialysis. Large molecules (> 1000 Da), like vancomycin, are poorly cleared by hemodialysis, although the availability of high-flux filters has increased the clearance of these drugs somewhat. Smaller molecules, like the β-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics, are largely cleared by hemodialysis, although this clearance is typically lower than with normal renal function. Protein binding has important effects on drug clearance with highly protein-bound drugs, like teicoplanin, oxacillin and ceftriaxone, having low dialysis clearance because the protein-bound fraction cannot be cleared. Finally, for antibiotics with a larger Vd there is typically less antibiotic in the vascular compartment and so less is available for clearance. This is seen with the quinolones, which have a comparatively larger Vd than the β-lactams or aminoglycosides.

In the absence of clinical PK and dosing data for hemodialysis in critically ill patients, valuable mechanistic insights can be gained from in vitro RRT models. Such experiments have shown that dialysate flow rate is the most important factor associated with hemodialysis clearance of drugs. More data are needed to improve dosing in hemodialysis as the sub-optimal achievement of target concentrations seen in the early phase of therapy in critically ill patients receiving CRRT is likely to also be problematic with intermittent techniques.

Antibiotics are commonly required during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); however, few data are available regarding antibiotic PK during ECMO. The major changes in ECMO are increased Vd and decreased drug clearance, although the extent of such changes remains poorly characterized. Antibiotic concentrations may be further altered during ECMO because of the circuit itself (with associated drug sequestration) and/or the associated systemic inflammation (with vasodilation and capillary leak).

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and on continuous renal replacement therapy: can we resolve this problem with pharmacokinetic studies and dosing guidelines? [^02029d29]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The review article from Ulldemolins and colleagues in this issue of Critical Care seeks to describe the challenges of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients who have septic shock and who are receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Along with patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or those with augmented renal clearance or rapidly changing organ function, the patient population reviewed here is one of the most challenging for drug dosing.

The dosing of antibiotics is more complex than that of other therapeutic classes, such as sedatives, vasoactive agents, and other drugs commonly used in the intensive care unit, because an 'end-of-needle' effect is not apparent. This complicates attempts to titrate antibiotic dosing on the basis of clinical evolution. Given that critically ill patients who have sepsis and who are receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) have a 50% higher mortality than their non-septic equivalents and that the mortality rate is unacceptably high (more than 60%), optimizing antibiotic therapy should be seen as vital to improve patient outcomes. However, optimal dosing in such patients is clearly a challenge, and effective guidance on empiric dosing in at-risk individuals is needed. Ensuring that empiric doses achieve concentrations associated with maximal bacterial killing is essential to therapeutic success.

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients receiving CRRT: underdosing is overprevalent [^fd04ae4f]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Published CRRT drug dosing algorithms and other dosing guidelines appear to result in underdosed antibiotics, leading to failure to attain pharmacodynamic targets. High mortality rates persist with inadequate antibiotic therapy as the most important risk factor for death. Reasons for unintended antibiotic underdosing in patients receiving CRRT are many. Underdosing may result from lack of the recognition that better hepatic function in AKI patients yields higher nonrenal antibiotic clearance compared to ESRD patients. Other factors include the variability in body size and fluid composition of patients, the serious consequence of delayed achievement of antibiotic pharmacodynamic targets in septic patients, potential subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations at the infection site, and the influence of RRT intensity on antibiotic concentrations. Too often, clinicians weigh the benefits of overcautious antibiotic dosing to avoid antibiotic toxicity too heavily against the benefits of rapid attainment of therapeutic antibiotic concentrations in critically ill patients receiving CRRT. We urge clinicians to prescribe antibiotics aggressively for these vulnerable patients.

### Drug dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy [^1eda049d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has given clinicians an important option in the care of critically ill patients. The slow and continuous dialysate and ultrafiltrate flow rates that are employed with CRRT can yield drug clearances similar to an analogous glomerular filtration rate of the native kidneys. Advantages such as superior volume control, excellent metabolic control, and hemodynamic tolerance by critically ill patients are well documented, but an understanding of drug dosing for CRRT is still a bit of a mystery. Although some pharmaceutical companies have dedicated postmarket research in this direction, many pharmaceutical companies have chosen not to pursue this information as it is not mandated and represents a relatively small part of their market. This lack of valuable information has created many challenges in the care of the critically ill patient as intermittent hemodialysis drug dosing recommendations cannot be extrapolated to CRRT. This drug dosing review will highlight factors that clinicians should consider when determining a pharmacotherapy regimen for a patient receiving CRRT.

### Cefiderocol dosing for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^ee07dd10]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In this report, we describe our scientific approach for including effluent flow rate (Q E)-based dosing recommendations of cefiderocol for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the product labeling. The total clearance (CL) of cefiderocol in patients receiving CRRT was estimated as the sum of patients' nonrenal clearance (CL nonrenal) and extracorporeal clearance by CRRT (CL CRRT), based on the following rationale: (a) The renal clearance (CL renal) of cefiderocol is assumed to be negligible in patients receiving CRRT, (b) CL nonrenal represents the CRRT patients' own remaining systemic clearance and is estimated from the observed clearance in participants with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 15mL/minute without undergoing hemodialysis, and (c) CL CRRT was estimated by the product of unbound (free) fraction of plasma drug concentration (f u) and Q E because the free fraction of low-molecular-weight compounds like cefiderocol (752Da) can be completely filtered by CRRT, regardless of CRRT modality. Hence, cefiderocol CL in CRRT patients was calculated by the equation of CL = CL nonrenal +f u ×Q E. Accordingly, the cefiderocol dosing regimens for patients receiving CRRT in clinically relevant ranges of Q E were determined with the goal of achieving an average daily area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) observed in patients not receiving CRRT. Subsequently, pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations demonstrated that cefiderocol PK profiles following the Q E -based dosing in patients receiving CRRT would be similar to those in patients not receiving CRRT.

### How I prescribe continuous renal replacement therapy [^8d066a67]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

CRRT dose

CRRT dose is essentially quantified by the effluent flow rate and there is no survival benefit from a dose > 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. We prescribe an effluent flow rate of 25 mL/kg/h to achieve a delivered dose of at least 20 mL/kg/h. Patients with severe metabolic derangements may benefit from higher CRRT dosage. In patients with hyperammonaemia (> 100 µmol/L), we prescribe 50 mL/kg/h of effluent flow rate to target levels < 100 µmol/L. We prescribe a similar intensity CRRT for severe hyperkalaemia.

### CRRT prescription and delivery of dose [^04c0ca59]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred modality of extracorporeal renal support for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The dose of CRRT is reported as effluent flow in ml/kg body weight per hour (ml/kg/h). Solid evidence supports that the delivered CRRT effluent dose for critically ill patients with AKI should be 20–25 ml/kg/h on average. To account for treatment interruptions and the natural decline in filter efficiency over time, it is recommended to prescribe 25–30 ml/kg/h of effluent dose. However, transient higher doses of CRRT in specific clinical scenarios may be needed to accommodate specific solute control needs of a particular patient at a given time. Consequently, there should be consideration of the potential adverse consequences of non-selective clearance such as undesired antimicrobials and nutrients removal. In this manuscript, we provide a summary of evidence related to CRRT dose, practical aspects for its calculation at the time of prescribing CRRT, and considerations for addressing the expected gap between prescribed and delivered CRRT dose. We also provide a framework for monitoring and implementation of CRRT dose as a quality indicator of CRRT delivery.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: how can we optimize therapy? [^cad5446b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Correct antibiotic treatment is of utmost importance to treat infections in critically ill patients, not only in terms of spectrum and timing but also in terms of dosing. However, this is a real challenge for the clinician because the pathophysiology (such as shock, augmented renal clearance, and multiple organ dysfunction) has a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of hydrophilic antibiotics. The presence of extra-corporal circuits, such as continuous renal replacement therapy, may further complicate this difficult exercise. Standard dosing may result in inadequate concentrations, but unadjusted dosing regimens may lead to toxicity. Recent studies confirm the variability in concentrations, and the wide variation in dialysis techniques used certainly contributes to these findings. Well-designed clinical studies are needed to provide the data from which robust dosing guidance can be developed. In the meantime, non-adjusted dosing in the first 1 to 2 days of antibiotic therapy during continuous renal replacement therapy followed by dose reduction later on seems to be a prudent approach.

### Expert clinical pharmacological advice may make an antimicrobial TDM program for emerging candidates more clinically useful in tailoring therapy of critically ill patients [^2a0376be]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The finding of an overall need of antimicrobial dosing adjustments in almost half of cases may support the relevant role that the ECPA program had in optimizing antimicrobial exposure during the whole treatment period. Pathophysiological alterations of critically septic patients commonly lead to changes in volume of distribution and clearance of hydrophilic antimicrobials with sudden variations in both plasma and tissue concentrations during the entire treatment course. Fluctuations in renal function during ICU stay may range from ARC to severe AKI with the need of CRRT or vice versa in a given septic patient, and this may clearly affect the likelihood of attaining optimal PK/PD targets. This is especially true for beta-lactams, which accounted for almost 70% of delivered ECPAs. In this scenario, close reassessments of antimicrobial concentrations over time become crucial and may result in a non-negligible proportion of dosing adjustments, as reported in our analysis.

It is worth noting that in most cases the TAT of the TDM-guided ECPAs was optimal, namely < 12 h. This allowed intensive care physicians to promptly adapt dosing in different challenging scenarios. On the one hand, this approach may minimize the risk of antimicrobial underexposure potentially associated with clinical failure and/or resistance development. On the other hand, it may prevent the occurrence of overexposure potentially associated with toxicity, which may be especially relevant for narrow therapeutic index antimicrobials, like linezolid.

Optimal TATs allowed TDM reassessment every 48–72 h in most cases. In this scenario, implementing a coordinated multidisciplinary taskforce becomes essential, and the MD Clinical Pharmacologist should necessarily move from the bench to the bedside for establishing a direct and useful on field relationship with the intensive care physicians. This strategy was helpful in allowing timely identification of sudden pathophysiological alterations and/or in updating microbiological culture results. Expert interpretation of TDM reassessments was fundamental in optimizing the therapeutic strategy in each single patient. Unfortunately, the median TATs of ECPAs for fluconazole, voriconazole, and levofloxacin were quasi-optimal (i.e. 12–24 h). This was not due to any specific issue about expert interpretation, but simply to logistic aspects since in some cases blood collection for TDM was drawn in the early afternoon.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: how can we optimize therapy? [^34d9605a]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

RRT does, however, affect antibiotic concentrations as antibiotics are also eliminated from the circulation. The rate at which this occurs is affected by the physicochemical characteristics of the drug and the type and intensity of RRT used, among other factors. Antibiotics with a small volume of distribution and low protein binding will be affected more. It can be expected that CRRT techniques are more efficient in removing antibiotics from the blood.

Several studies have addressed this issue in recent years. Seyler and colleagues found that patients treated with CRRT had overall low target attainment in the early phase of therapy when recommended doses are used and when four times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the least susceptible microorganism is aimed for. Later during therapy, concentrations were higher for meropenem, piperacillin, and ceftazidime - in all patients, these drugs were administered as intermittent infusion. Bauer and colleagues found that there was an important interindividual variability in piperacillin concentrations and that CRRT dose was the only factor associated with piperacillin elimination. This variability was confirmed by Roberts and colleagues in a similar patient cohort, with both under- and overdosing occurring in about 10% of the patients, depending on the PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) target considered. In all of these studies, the variability of antibiotic doses administered is striking; this, on the one hand, reflects the uncertainty of the clinician on how RRT may affect antibiotic concentrations but, on the other hand, adds a level of complexity when it comes to analyzing target attainment in different studies. Furthermore, the intervals between start of antibiotic therapy and sampling as well as RRT initiation and sampling are additional confounders when target attainment is analyzed in these studies. In a systematic review, Vaara and colleagues found the overall quality of studies investigating the effect of RRT moderate, as the many important RRT parameters were often lacking.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^9cbd87d1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using levofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

The pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in younger adults and elderly adults do not differ significantly when creatinine clearance is taken into consideration. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^edbf6730]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis antimicrobial dosing — pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization (BPS): We recommend using antimicrobial dosing strategies that have been optimized based on published pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic principles and with consideration of specific drug properties (BPS). Sepsis may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials; in particular, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) both lead to profound alteration of antimicrobial clearance, requiring individual dose adaptation, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, can permit individualized antimicrobial dosing to achieve maximal effect while minimizing toxicity. Determinants of antimicrobial efficacy include the time concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC), the peak concentration to MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC), and the ratio of the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve divided by the MIC (AUC24/MIC). Time dependent antibiotics include beta-lactams and lincosamides; for concentration-dependent agents such as aminoglycosides and metronidazole, drug concentrations measured within 60 minutes before or after administration are used to estimate the Cmin and Cmax to help guide dosing, and these agents may require an altered dosing frequency to maximize bacterial killing by preserving the Cpeak/MIC. Glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, fluoroquinolones, polymixins, daptomycin, azithromycin, and tigecycline are examples of concentration-dependent with time-dependent antibiotics; for vancomycin, continuous infusions may be considered to achieve optimal concentrations in some patients, and for this class dose optimization involves adjusting the dosing interval rather than administered dose.

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and on continuous renal replacement therapy: can we resolve this problem with pharmacokinetic studies and dosing guidelines? [^ac15fe97]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Dosing antibiotics in critically ill patients to achieve therapeutic concentrations is a significant challenge. The presence of septic shock and prescription of continuous renal replacement therapy introduces further complexities for the clinician. Unfortunately, this is a dilemma encountered daily by intensivists. Although small pharmacokinetic studies are emerging to provide data to help address this problem, the variability in results from these studies is profound. As such, effective antibiotic dosing guidelines for critically ill patients who have septic shock and who receive continuous renal replacement therapy are not available. Dosing flowcharts and therapeutic drug monitoring represent the best available options for clinicians to optimize antibiotic dosing.

### Recommended β-lactam regimens are inadequate in septic patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy [^ae7fbdf7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity and mortality in ICUs. Antibiotic treatment, if adequate and given early, remains of paramount importance to optimise chances of survival. Several studies have shown the crucial impact of the first 24 hours of antimicrobial treatment on outcome. In addition to timing, the chosen antibiotic should target the potential pathogens involved, taking local susceptibility patterns into account. To be effective, the doses given should reach therapeutic concentrations in the blood and at the site of infection. Sepsis can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials and result in subtherapeutic drug concentrations, potentially contributing to decreased bacterial killing, therapeutic failure and emergence of resistance.

Acute renal failure is a common complication of sepsis. In septic patients, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is often preferred to conventional haemodialysis because it is better tolerated haemodynamically. However, CRRT can further alter the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics. These changes depend on several variables, such as the ultrafiltrate and dialysate rates, dialysate concentrations and the type of membrane used - each of these variables introducing additional variability in expected drug concentrations. A recent systematic review addressed the importance of all these factors for antibiotic prescription, but the most recent recommendations on antibiotic dosing during CRRT were established using evidence from studies that included a limited number of patients, with varying inclusion/exclusion criteria and receiving different types of CRRT. Serum measurements were usually performed at steady state, which also limits the extrapolation of results to the early phase of sepsis, during which patients are often haemodynamically unstable. Finally, these recommendations have never been validated in a septic ICU population suffering from multiple organ failure.

The objective of our study was to evaluate whether the recommended doses of broad-spectrum β-lactams result in appropriate serum concentrations in ICU patients with severe sepsis and septic shock receiving CRRT.

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^ad018165]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have identified marked variability in systemic CL and Vd of multiple antibiotics in critically ill patients with AKI and also the variable influence of CRRT regimen on extracorporeal CL. Taken together, such variability complicates empiric antibiotic prescribing during CRRT. Ongoing research to further explore what factors contribute to this variability is important. In the meantime, drug monitoring may be the most practical method for ensuring that antibiotic therapeutic targets are achieved in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

### Pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in intensive care unit patients who have acute renal failure and undergo extended daily dialysis [^f8eecdd7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Extended daily dialysis (EDD) is increasingly popular in the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF). EDD could remove drugs to a much different degree compared with intermittent standard hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies; however, there are only scarce data on how EDD influences the pharmacokinetics of frequently used drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of two quinolone antibiotics in patients who had anuric ARF and were being treated with EDD. Adult patients who were in the intensive care unit at a tertiary care university hospital and receiving moxifloxacin (n = 10) or levofloxacin (n = 5) therapy were included. The antibiotics were administered intravenously 8 h (400 mg of moxifloxacin) or 12 h (500 mg of levofloxacin) before EDD to study pharmacokinetics off and on EDD. Treatment lasted 8 h; blood and dialysate flow rates were 160 ml/min. In addition to standard pharmacokinetic parameters, the total dialysate concentration of both drugs was measured using a technically simple single-pass batch dialysis system for EDD. Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients who had ARF and were undergoing EDD were similar to those in healthy subjects without renal impairment. Levofloxacin, although removed by EDD, had a lower total clearance compared with healthy subjects. According to these findings, anuric critically ill patients who are undergoing EDD should be treated with the standard dosage of moxifloxacin (400 mg/d intravenously). The levofloxacin dosage, however, should be reduced according to the intensity of renal replacement therapy.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^9e189cd5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using levofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

The pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in younger adults and elderly adults do not differ significantly when creatinine clearance is taken into consideration. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Pharmacokinetic assessment in patients receiving continuous RRT: perspectives from the kidney health initiative [^4cb63112]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The effect of AKI and modern continuous RRT (CRRT) methods on drug disposition (pharmacokinetics) and response has been poorly studied. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have little incentive to perform pharmacokinetic studies in patients undergoing CRRT because such studies are neither recommended in existing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance documents nor required for new drug approval. Action is urgently needed to address the knowledge deficit. The Kidney Health Initiative has assembled a work group composed of clinicians and scientists representing academia, the FDA, and the pharmaceutical and dialysis industries with expertise related to pharmacokinetics, AKI, and/or CRRT. The work group critically evaluated key considerations in the assessment of pharmacokinetics and drug dosing in CRRT, practical constraints related to conducting pharmacokinetic studies in critically ill patients, and the generalizability of observations made in the context of specific CRRT prescriptions and specific patient populations in order to identify efficient study designs capable of addressing the knowledge deficit without impeding drug development. Considerations for the standardized assessment of pharmacokinetics and development of corresponding drug dosing recommendations in critically ill patients with AKI receiving CRRT are proposed.

### Beta-lactam dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: a survey of practices in French intensive care units [^2fdb8056]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-lactams are the most widely prescribed antibiotics in critically ill patients. Optimized dosing of beta-lactams is required to deal with pharmacokinetic changes and frequent underdosing – especially during the early phase of sepsis. Renal failure may protect patients from insufficient antibiotic exposure by increasing the probability of beta-lactam target concentration attainment, and patients may benefit from high doses – particularly during the first 24 to 48 h of antibiotic treatment. Several experts have called for caution when using reduced dosing regimens in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Seyler et al. demonstrated the inadequacy of the recommended beta-lactam dosing regimens during CRRT when bacteria with a high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) are involved. Underdosing has prompted several experts to suggest the use of non-adjusted dosing within the first 24 to 48 h, albeit with a potential risk of overdose. Although beta-lactam dosing can be guided by clinical and pharmacokinetic data from the literature, the studies concern mainly intermittent hemodialysis and cannot be applied to CRRT, for which a variety of practices are used. Li and Vaara highlighted the lack of key information required to correctly interpret studies and devise dose adjustments. In 2019, these marked differences in CRRT practices and the subsequent influence on beta-lactam elimination prompted two French learned societies to recommend therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactams in patients receiving CRRT. In 2020, several international learned societies recommended TDM for routine use in critically ill patients. However, TDM is not often available outside university hospitals. Given these uncertainties and our experience that neurotoxicity is more frequent in patients receiving CRRT, we decided to survey beta-lactam dosing practices during CRRT in France.

### Levofloxacin [^26632da1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Male and Female Subjects

There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy male subjects, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.5 hours, as compared to approximately 6.1 hours in female subjects. This difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the male and female subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by the gender of the subjects. Dose adjustment based on gender alone is not necessary.

Racial or Ethnic Groups

The effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was examined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and 24 non-white. The apparent total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not affected by the race of the subjects.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in adult patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Patients with Bacterial Infection

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in patients with serious community-acquired bacterial infections are comparable to those observed in healthy subjects.

Drug Interaction Studies The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between levofloxacin and antacids, warfarin, theophylline, cyclosporine, digoxin, probenecid, and cimetidine has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^c67c3709]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may alter antibiotic pharmacokinetics and increase the risk of incorrect dosing. In a nested cohort within a large randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effect of higher (40 mL/kg per hour) and lower (25 mL/kg per hour) intensity CRRT on antibiotic pharmacokinetics.

Methods

We collected serial blood samples to measure ciprofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin levels. We calculated extracorporeal clearance (CL), systemic CL, and volume of distribution (Vd) by non-linear mixed-effects modelling. We assessed the influence of CRRT intensity and other patient factors on antibiotic pharmacokinetics.

Results

We studied 24 patients who provided 179 pairs of samples. Extracorporeal CL increased with higher-intensity CRRT but the increase was significant for vancomycin only (mean 28 versus 22 mL/minute; P = 0.0003). At any given prescribed CRRT effluent rate, extracorporeal CL of individual antibiotics varied widely, and the effluent-to-plasma concentration ratio decreased with increasing effluent flow. Overall, systemic CL varied to a greater extent than Vd, particularly for meropenem, piperacillin, and tazobactam, and large intra-individual differences were also observed. CRRT dose did not influence overall (systemic) CL, Vd, or half-life. The proportion of systemic CL due to CRRT varied widely and was high in some cases.

Conclusions

In patients receiving CRRT, there is great variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics, which complicates an empiric approach to dosing and suggests the need for therapeutic drug monitoring. More research is required to investigate the apparent relative decrease in clearance at higher CRRT effluent rates.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^b1f52da2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To inform safe fluoroquinolone prescribing in patients with advanced CKD, we conducted a population-based study of older adults with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (excluding those receiving dialysis) and examined the risk of serious adverse events in patients who were treated with a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose. We defined a higher-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 501 to 1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501 to 750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401 to 800 mg/d. We defined a lower-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250 to 500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d. The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or collagen-associated events.

### Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in ESRD and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer [^809bdaf4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

No published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients.

Methods

Eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. Serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression analysis using Adapt II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Ratios of maximum serum concentration (C(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) data from published studies.

Results

All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. Median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and C(max) were 37.0 mL/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 mL/min), 103.3 L (range, 39.8 to 139.3 L), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/mL (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/mL), respectively. Median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 mL/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 mL/min) and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. Median C(max)-MIC90 ratios were 10 or greater for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Conclusion

The administration of levofloxacin to patients with ESRD as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 48 hours, will provide adequate C(max)-MIC ratios after the first and subsequent doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin MICs of 1 microg/mL or less.

### Beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and continuous renal replacement therapy [^d0ff1c00]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Main limitations of available pharmacokinetic studies

To discuss the current scenario of beta-lactam dosing in patients with septic shock and CRRT, we performed a thorough review of the existing clinical data for three of the most frequently used (and studied) beta-lactam antibiotics in the ICU. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 summarize the available evidence on meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with CRRT.

Critical review of these studies has lead to identification of the following points that limit applicability of dose recommendations to critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT.

### Drug dosing considerations in continuous renal replacement therapy [^25bfc33d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients, which is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Delivering effective antibiotics to treat patients with sepsis receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) is complicated by variability in pharmacokinetics, dialysis delivery, lack of primary literature, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Pharmacokinetic alterations include changes in absorption, distribution, protein binding (PB), metabolism, and renal elimination. Drug absorption may be significantly changed due to alterations in gastric pH, perfusion, gastrointestinal motility, and intestinal atrophy. Volume of distribution for hydrophilic drugs may be increased due to volume overload. Estimation of renal clearance is challenged by the effective delivery of RRT. Drug characteristics such as PB, volume of distribution, and molecular weight impact removal of the drug by RRT. The totality of these alterations leads to reduced exposure. Despite our best knowledge, therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving continuous RRT demonstrates wide variability in antimicrobial concentrations, highlighting the need for expanded monitoring of all drugs. This review article will focus on changes in drug pharmacokinetics in AKI and dosing considerations to attain antibiotic pharmacodynamic targets in critically ill patients receiving continuous RRT.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^8c71b39b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function

The usual dose of levofloxacin injection is 250 mg or 500 mg administered by slow infusion over 60 minutes every 24 hours or 750 mg administered by slow infusion over 90 minutes every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1.

These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, adjustments to the dosing regimen are required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

The dosage in pediatric patients ≥ 6 months of age is described below in Table 2.

*Due to Bacillus anthracis [see Indications and Usage (1.13)] and Yersinia pestis [see Indications and Usage (1.14)].

†Sequential therapy (intravenous to oral) may be instituted at the discretion of the physician.

‡Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis. This indication is based on a surrogate endpoint. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations achieved in humans are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]

§The safety of levofloxacin in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.

¶Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Adults with Renal Impairment

Administer levofloxacin injection with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced.

No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.

In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.

### Beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and continuous renal replacement therapy [^5c7c65c6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Although early and appropriate antibiotic therapy remains the most important intervention for successful treatment of septic shock, data guiding optimization of beta-lactam prescription in critically ill patients prescribed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are still limited. Being small hydrophilic molecules, beta-lactams are likely to be cleared by CRRT to a significant extent. As a result, additional variability may be introduced to the per se variable antibiotic concentrations in critically ill patients. This article aims to describe the current clinical scenario for beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT, to highlight the sources of variability among the different studies that reduce extrapolation to clinical practice, and to identify the opportunities for future research and improvement in this field. Three frequently prescribed beta-lactams (meropenem, piperacillin and ceftriaxone) were chosen for review. Our findings showed that present dosing recommendations are based on studies with drawbacks limiting their applicability in the clinical setting. In general, current antibiotic dosing regimens for CRRT follow a one-size-fits-all fashion despite emerging clinical data suggesting that drug clearance is partially dependent on CRRT modality and intensity. Moreover, some studies pool data from heterogeneous populations with CRRT that may exhibit different pharmacokinetics (for example, admission diagnoses different to septic shock, such as trauma), which also limit their extrapolation to critically ill patients with septic shock. Finally, there is still no consensus regarding the %T > MIC (percentage of dosing interval when concentration of the antibiotic is above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the pathogen) value that should be chosen as the pharmacodynamic target for antibiotic therapy in patients with septic shock and CRRT. For empirically optimized dosing, during the first day a loading dose is required to compensate the increased volume of distribution, regardless of impaired organ function. An additional loading dose may be required when CRRT is initiated due to steady-state equilibrium breakage driven by clearance variation. From day 2, dosing must be adjusted to CRRT settings and residual renal function. Therapeutic drug monitoring of beta-lactams may be regarded as a useful tool to daily individualize dosing and to ensure optimal antibiotic exposure.

### Pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration [^076bff1d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effect of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF) on the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.

Design

Open-label study.

Setting

Anesthesiology ICU, University Hospital of Regensburg.

Patients

Six critically ill patients treated with CVVHF because of acute renal failure needing antimicrobial therapy.

Interventions

Levofloxacin i.v. 250 mg qd with a starting dose of 500 mg. CVVHF with the following characteristics: hemofilter AN69 hollow fibers of 0.90 m2 area, blood flow 150 ml/min, ultrafiltrate flow 1.3 l/h, filtrate substitution in post-dilution mode.

Measurements and Results

The plasma pharmacokinetics and clearance of levofloxacin by hemofiltration were established on day 1 and day 4–6 of treatment. Levofloxacin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean (range) peak plasma concentrations after levofloxacin 500 mg single dose (s.d.) and 250 mg multiple dose (m.d.) were 6.4 (2.7–9.4) and 8.2 (4.7–10.3) mg/l, trough levels 2.7 (1.4–5.0) and 2.9 (1.7–3.9) mg/l, half-life 28 (19–38) and 22 (17–31) h, volume of distribution 1.2 (0.72–1.6) l/kg and 0.91 (0.52–2.0) l/kg, respectively. The mean sieving coefficient was 0.96 (0.79–1.09), mean total clearance 47 (20–89) ml/min, and mean clearance by hemofiltration 21 (13–27) ml/min, respectively.

Conclusions

A dosage schedule of levofloxacin 250 mg qd with a 500 mg loading dose seems appropriate for anuric patients during CVVHF. Sufficiently high steady-state concentrations of levofloxacin were achieved after the first dose. Undesired accumulation of levofloxacin was not observed.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^4d97b524]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy male subjects, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.5 hours, as compared to approximately 6.1 hours in female subjects. This difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the male and female subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by the gender of the subjects. Dose adjustment based on gender alone is not necessary. Race

The effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was examined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and 24 non-white. The apparent total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not affected by the race of the subjects. Renal Impairment

Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in adult patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Bacterial Infection

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in patients with serious community-acquired bacterial infections are comparable to those observed in healthy subjects.

 Drug-Drug Interactions

The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between levofloxacin and antacids, warfarin, theophylline, cyclosporine, digoxin, probenecid, and cimetidine has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Inter-occasional pharmacokinetic variability

The concentration-time profile, clinical information, and pharmacokinetic parameters for two of the patients who provided samples on multiple days are shown in Figure 4. Much day-to-day variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics was noted, although each patient received a fixed dosage of CRRT.

Examples of inter-occasion variability in antibiotic pharmacokinetics. (a) Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) after coronary artery bypass grafts and valve repair, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors for hypotension (not attributed to sepsis). This patient received higher-intensity continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and did not survive to hospital discharge. Meropenem (1 g) was administered on each occasion. (b) Admission to the ICU from the emergency department and subsequently diagnosis with Klebsiella sepsis associated with a soft tissue infection, complicated by edema and hypoalbuminemia (24 g/L). Treatment included mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and dopamine infusion (decreasing requirements during admission, not required at the time of second samples).

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ There exists great variability in ciprofloxacin clearance in critically ill patients. Currently, instructions for ciprofloxacin dose adjustments based on renal function are inconsistent. It remains unclear what dosage should be given in critically ill patients.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study proposes a dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility in critically ill patients.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ High ciprofloxacin dosages (i.e. up to 2,400 mg daily) are estimated to be required for patients with augmented renal clearance (estimated glomerular filtration rate > 130 mL/min) and infections caused by pathogens with an MIC ≥ 0.25 mg/L.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ We propose an essential change in the dosing algorithm of ciprofloxacin for critically ill patients based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility that could result in better treatment outcome of this vulnerable population.

### Levofloxacin in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^26043ee1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The use of levofloxacin in critically ill patients has progressively increased since commercial marketing of the drug in 1999, despite the fact that few studies have been designed to assess the use of levofloxacin in this population. Pharmacological characteristics, broad spectrum of activity, and tolerability account for the high interest in the drug for the treatment of different infectious diseases, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the recommendation of levofloxacin in guidelines developed by a number of scientific societies. According to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data, it seems reasonable to assume that an increase in activity follows from a larger dose, so that 500 mg/12 h is adequate in patients with VAP. In critically ill patients with VAP, levofloxacin monotherapy is indicated for empirical treatment of patients with early onset pneumonia without risk factors for multiresistant pathogens, and in combination therapy for late onset VAP or for patients at risk for multiresistant pathogens. The use of levofloxacin in combination therapy is supported by multiple reasons, including: increased empirical coverage in infections with suspected intracellular pathogens; substitution for more toxic antimicrobial agents (e.g., aminoglycosides) in patients with renal dysfunction and in those at risk for renal insufficiency; and severity of systemic response to infection (septic shock) that justifies multiple treatment with better tolerated antibiotics. The availability of the oral formulation allows sequential therapy, switching from the intravenous route to the oral route. Levofloxacin is well tolerated by critically ill patients, with few adverse events of mild to moderate severity.

### Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^70ed0dcd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

The intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is generally assessed on the basis of small solute clearance with dosing usually expressed in terms of total effluent volume per unit time (e.g., ml/kg/hour). Although several clinical trials have suggested an improvement in survival with higher doses of CRRT, results have not been consistent across all studies. The results of recent trials of intensity of CRRT are reviewed. The largest and most recent trials suggest that there is no additional benefit to using effluent flow rates in excess of 20 ml/kg/hour, although earlier studies suggested improved survival with doses of 35 to 45 ml/kg/hour.

General

Alteration of the dosage regimen is recommended for patients with impairment of renal function (ClCr < 40 mL/min/1.73 m2). (See Dosage and Administration.)

Prescribing Maxaquin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^92068874]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV and chronic kidney disease dosing — isoniazid, levofloxacin, pentamidine, and pyrazinamide adjustments are as follows: Isoniazid usual dosage is 300 mg po q24h; for CKD or ESRD give 300 mg q24h with dosing post-hemodialysis on dialysis days. Levofloxacin usual dosage is 250–750 mg po q24h; for those receiving 500 mg po q24h adjust by renal function: CrCl 20–49 mL/min use 500 mg loading dose, then 250 mg q24h; CrCl 10–19 mL/min use 500 mg loading dose, then 250 mg q48h; with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis use 750–500 mg loading dose, then 250–500 mg q48h with dosing post-HD on dialysis days. Pentamidine usual dosage is 4.0 mg/kg of body weight IV q24h; for CrCl 10–50 mL/min use 3.0 mg/kg of body weight IV q24h (use with caution), and for CrCl < 10 mL/min use 4.0 mg/kg of body weight IV q48h. Pyrazinamide usual dosage is 20–25 mg/kg of body weight q24h; for CrCl < 10 mL/min use 15–20 mg/kg q24h, and with hemodialysis give 20 mg/kg q24h with dosing post-HD on dialysis days.

### Machines that help machines to help patients: optimising antimicrobial dosing in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy using dosing software [^6a8a0b41]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, residual renal function may significantly affect antimicrobial drug dosing. Patients with residual renal function have been shown to require increased dosing/dosing frequency of linezolid and meropenem when compared with anuric patients.

Pharmacological considerations for antimicrobials are also important. Altered protein binding may be associated with drug CL changes because only the unbound fraction can be cleared across the hemofilter. During critical illness, albumin and α 1 -acid glycoprotein concentrations can be altered impacting the PK of acidic and basic drugs, respectively. Typically, high protein-bound antimicrobials (e.g. cefazolin, ceftriaxone, and teicoplanin) are not significantly affected by RRT. However, wide variations in protein binding occur in critically ill patients, especially in the case of hypoalbuminemia, which has been commonly reported and studied thus far. This can increase RRT-related CL and affect antibiotic exposure. The extent to which a drug is removed by dialysis is strongly influenced by the physicochemical properties of the drug and the apparent V d. In general, lipophilic drugs, such as macrolides, quinolones, and echinocandins, which exhibit large apparent V d are less affected by RRT compared to hydrophilic drugs, such as beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, because a low proportion of the drug is present in the bloodstream from where clearance occurs. However, for echinocandins, significant adsorption could occur with highly adsorptive membranes (e.g. AN69 surface-treated and poly-methyl-methacrylate filters) and deserve further investigations to determine optimal dosing in CRRT patients.

Drug dosing for critically ill patients receiving RRT remains challenging. Thus, a rational approach to antibiotic dosing during RRT in ICU patients consists of high loading doses to avoid low concentrations associated with increased apparent V d, adjustments of first maintenance dose based on the effluent flow rate (Table 2), and subsequent adjustment as guided by TDM and Bayesian dosing software. Additionally, the site of infection and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of causative pathogens should be considered whilst choosing the optimal antimicrobial dosing regimen for patients on RRT.

### Clinical review: optimal dose of continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^40019322]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred treatment for acute kidney injury in intensive care units (ICUs) throughout much of the world. Despite the widespread use of CRRT, controversy and center-specific practice variation in the clinical application of CRRT continue. In particular, whereas two single-center studies have suggested survival benefit from delivery of higher-intensity CRRT to patients with acute kidney injury in the ICU, other studies have been inconsistent in their results. Now, however, two large multi-center randomized controlled trials - the Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study and the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study - have provided level 1 evidence that effluent flow rates above 25 mL/kg per hour do not improve outcomes in patients in the ICU. In this review, we discuss the concept of dose of CRRT, its relationship with clinical outcomes, and what target optimal dose of CRRT should be pursued in light of the high-quality evidence now available.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^0e2292f6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Male and Female Subjects

There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy male subjects, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.5 hours, as compared to approximately 6.1 hours in female subjects. This difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the male and female subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by the gender of the subjects. Dose adjustment based on gender alone is not necessary.

Racial or Ethnic Groups

The effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was examined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and 24 non-white. The apparent total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not affected by the race of the subjects.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in adult patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Patients with Bacterial Infection

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in patients with serious community-acquired bacterial infections are comparable to those observed in healthy subjects.

Drug Interaction Studies

The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between levofloxacin and antacids, warfarin, theophylline, cyclosporine, digoxin, probenecid, and cimetidine has been evaluated [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^ced08bba]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Use of extracorporeal support techniques in critical care

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 50 to 65% of critically ill patients and in approximately two-thirds of patients within the first 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill patients are usually supported with one of the forms of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) — continuous venous-venous hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, hemodialysis (CVVHF, CVVHDF, CVVHD, respectively) — or with sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED). Molecules are transported across the filter membrane by the mechanism of convection (driven by the pressure gradient — CVVHF), diffusion (driven by the concentration gradient — CVVHD, SLED), or both (CVVHDF).

Employing CRRT complicates antibiotic dosing to a significantly higher extent than standard hemodialysis due to the high number of variables, including Vd, flow of the dialysis fluid, replacement fluid infusion site (pre- or post-dilution mode), type and surface of the used membrane, and the difference between delivered and prescribed RRT dose.

Vd in AKI may be significantly different from published population estimates derived from healthy subjects. Besides the decreased plasma protein concentrations in acutely ill patients, uremic solutes, such as hippurate and indoxyl sulfate, alter drug binding to albumin in chronic renal failure and might do so in acute renal failure, although this has not been tested. The free fraction of many drugs is increased in renal failure, even though the Vd for total drug may increase due to movement of unbound drug into interstitial or total body water.

### The effect of renal dysfunction on antimicrobial use measurements [^247e68bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The defined daily dose, a popular measurement of antimicrobial use, may underestimate the use of antimicrobials that are dose-adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. To evaluate the effect of renal dysfunction on these measures, we performed a retrospective cohort study that involved patients receiving ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, or vancomycin, with use of defined daily doses and 2 methods based on therapy duration — stop-start days (i.e., entire therapy duration) and transaction days (i.e., unique therapeutic days). The vancomycin use rate for patients with renal insufficiency was 36% lower than that of patients with normal renal function for defined daily doses, and it was 23% lower for transaction days; for levofloxacin, there was a 27% rate reduction for the defined daily dose. No significant reduction was noted when the stop-start day method was used. Compared with the defined daily dose method, measures of therapy duration are less affected by renal function and may improve comparisons between populations.

### Medication dosing in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy [^c31ba521]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury may be treated with a variety of renal replacement therapies (RRTs). Each of these RRTs has profound yet differing effects on drug dosing. Although the doses of some drugs can be titrated to an immediately observable pharmacodynamic effect, the effects of many drugs, such as antibiotics for example, are not immediately apparent. Attainment of desired pharmacodynamic response is a complex interplay between patient, RRT, and pharmacokinetic factors. In the case of antibiotics, microorganism-specific factors also must be considered. Rational and effective drug dosing in this clinical setting cannot occur until all these issues are addressed by the clinician. Failure to account for the pharmacokinetic influences of critical illness, kidney disease, and choice of intermittent hemodialysis or prolonged intermittent or continuous RRT can contribute to the high mortality rates seen in these patients. Pharmacotherapy considerations for each of these therapies are addressed in this article by applying them to a patient case.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy: who, when, why, and how [^4d0a941a]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is commonly used to provide renal support for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, particularly patients who are hemodynamically unstable. A variety of techniques that differ in their mode of solute clearance may be used, including continuous venovenous hemofiltration with predominantly convective solute clearance, continuous venovenous hemodialysis with predominantly diffusive solute clearance, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, which combines both dialysis and hemofiltration. The present article compares CRRT with other modalities of renal support and reviews indications for initiation of renal replacement therapy, as well as dosing and technical aspects in the management of CRRT.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^8f39ce94]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Cohort

We assembled a cohort of adults 66 years and older with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (excluding patients receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) who received a new prescription for a single oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or norfloxacin) dispensed from an outpatient pharmacy between January 1, 2008, and March 17, 2020. The dispense date served as the date of cohort entry (ie, the index date). The age threshold of 66 years and older was used to ensure all patients had at least 1 year of prescription drug coverage before the index date. We restricted the cohort to patients with at least 1 serum creatinine measurement in the period from 1 year to 7 days before the index date (we excluded those with measurements within the 7-day period before the index date because these creatinine values may be elevated owing to acute infection).

To ensure patients were new fluoroquinolone users, we excluded those with evidence of fluoroquinolone use in the 180-day period before the index date. Ontario health care databases do not contain in-hospital treatment information, which may introduce an immeasurable time bias in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. To ensure study antibiotic treatments were initiated in an outpatient setting and to reduce the immeasurable time bias, we excluded patients discharged from the hospital or emergency department within 2 days before the index date (in Ontario, patients who start a fluoroquinolone prescription during a hospital admission would have their outpatient prescription dispensed on the same day or the day after hospital discharge). To ensure generalizability to usual prescribing, we excluded patients prescribed nonstandard doses (ie, ciprofloxacin, < 500 mg/d or > 1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, < 250 mg/d or > 750 mg/d; and norfloxacin, < 400 mg/d or > 800 mg/d). We also excluded patients prescribed a topical fluoroquinolone. Each patient could only enter the cohort once. This study had 80% power to detect a relative risk increase of at least a 58% for the primary outcome (corresponding to a risk ratio [RR] of 1.58; 2-sided α = .05; an incidence of 1% of the primary outcome in patients initiating treatment with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone) based on a feasibility analysis results.

### Antibiotic dosing in slow extended daily dialysis [^4bcbea90]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Slow extended daily dialysis (SLEDD) is the newest form of dialysis that is being used increasingly to replace continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for critically ill patients; it is less expensive to administer and has similar safety for patients who are prone to hemodynamic instability. Unfortunately, there are limited data regarding the appropriate dosing of antimicrobial agents for patients undergoing SLEDD. Furthermore, many nonnephrologists are not familiar with the differences between SLEDD, other continuous renal replacement therapies — for example, CVVHD — and routine hemodialysis. Thus, there is potential for inaccurate and, at worst, inadequate dosing of critical antimicrobial agents for this patient population. We review the available pharmacokinetic data on SLEDD and give preliminary recommendations for how to approach dosing in this situation.

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^6e5a165f]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial sepsis is common and increases mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The administration of antibiotics is a key component of therapy in these patients. The influence of antibiotic concentration on bacterial kill has been determined in vitro and is the basis of current approaches to antibiotic dosing. Logically, incorrect dosing secondary to a poor understanding of pharmacokinetics may contribute to adverse outcomes, including treatment failure or the escalation of antibiotic resistance.

Key aspects of pharmacokinetics like antibiotic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) are altered in critically ill patients with AKI because of loss or renal clearance, volume expansion, and interventions such as vasopressors and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Moreover, extracorporeal CL during CRRT is influenced by the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the antibiotic, blood flow, dialysate flow, and ultrafiltration rate and by membrane fouling and filter clotting. These variables may lead to sub-therapeutic blood concentrations and contribute to treatment failure. However, data on antibiotic pharmacokinetics during CRRT are limited in scope and detail, making correct prescription problematic. Accordingly, in patients treated with CRRT of different intensities, we aimed to evaluate variability in CL and Vd and to assess the effect of the CRRT prescription on extracorporeal and systemic antibiotic CL and Vd.

### Cefiderocol sulfate tosylate (Fetroja) [^f6cd92b4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage of FETROJA is 2 grams administered every 8 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 3 hours in adults with a creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 60 to 119 mL/min.

Dosage adjustment of FETROJA is recommended for patients with CLcr less than 60 mL/min, including patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis (HD) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and for patients with CLcr 120 mL/min or greater [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The recommended duration of treatment with FETROJA is 7 to 14 days. The duration of therapy should be guided by the patient's clinical status.

2.2 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with CLcr Less Than 60 mL/min (Including Patients Undergoing Intermittent HD or CRRT), and CLcr 120 mL/min or Greater

Dosage Adjustments in Patients with CLcr Less Than 60 mL/min Including Patients Receiving Intermittent HD

Dosage adjustment of FETROJA is recommended in patients with CLcr less than 60 mL/min (Table 1). For patients undergoing intermittent HD, start the dosing of FETROJA immediately after the completion of HD. For patients with fluctuating renal function, monitor CLcr and adjust dosage accordingly.

Dosage Adjustments in Patients Receiving CRRT

For patients receiving CRRT, including continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), the dosage of FETROJA should be based on the effluent flow rate in CRRT (see Table 2). These recommendations are intended to provide initial dosing in patients receiving CRRT. Dosing regimens may need to be tailored based on residual renal function and patient's clinical status [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Dosage Adjustments in Patients with CLcr 120 mL/min or Greater

For patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 120 mL/min, FETROJA 2 grams administered every 6 hours by IV infusion over 3 hours is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Tigecycline in critically ill patients on continuous renal replacement therapy: a population pharmacokinetic study [^72e712eb]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tigecycline is the first example of a glycylcycline, a new derivative of tetracyclines, and an important option for the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in ICU patients and may require renal replacement therapy (RRT). Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are well established and very effective continuous RRT (CRRT) methods that can cause enhanced elimination of drugs, including antibiotics. Accordingly, higher doses of antibiotics may be necessary in patients with AKI during CRRT. No dosage adjustment of tigecycline is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing hemodialysis, but data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) during CRRT are lacking. The aim of this study was to provide pharmacokinetic data in ICU patients undergoing CVVHD or CVVHDF, and to explore the potential need for dose adjustments by a probability of target attainment analysis.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^fd731594]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dose in AKI — delivered versus prescribed and outcomes: Seven RCTs have investigated CRRT dose, and in the Randomized Evaluation of Normal vs. Augmented Level of RRT across 35 centers using postdilution CVVHDF at doses of 25 and 40 ml/kg/h in 1464 AKI patients, the delivered dose was 88% and 84% of prescribed with no difference in 28- or 90-day mortality; in ARFTN, more than 95% of the prescribed dose of CRRT was delivered in the less-intensive group. There are now consistent data from two large multicenter trials showing no benefits of increasing CRRT doses above effluent flows of 20–25 ml/kg/h, and in clinical practice, in order to achieve a delivered dose of 20–25 ml/kg/h, it is generally necessary to prescribe in the range of 25–30 ml/kg/h, and to minimize interruptions in CRRT.

### Tigecycline in critically ill patients on continuous renal replacement therapy: a population pharmacokinetic study [^00116841]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The pharmacokinetic parameters of tigecycline are not significantly influenced by CRRT. The probability of target attainment was similar in the present patient collective receiving CRRT compared with patients with no AKI, indicating that no dose adjustment seems necessary in CRRT.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^a4ebb2ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Fluoroquinolones were prescribed at higher than recommended doses in 5482 of 11 917 patients (46.0%); 6435 patients (54.0%) received a lower-dose fluoroquinolone. The median doses and days of continuous dispensing for each antibiotic in those prescribed higher vs lower doses is shown in eTable 10 in the Supplement. Characteristics of patients who started at higher vs lower doses are shown in Table 1 (the full set of 147 characteristics is shown in eTable 11 in the Supplement). Before any weighting, almost all indications for fluoroquinolone treatment were balanced between the 2 groups (high vs low dose). The proportion of patients with a recorded diagnosis of urinary tract infection (998 of 5482 [18.2%] vs 1266 of 6435 [19.7%]), prosthetic joint infection (766 of 5482 [14.0%] vs 854 of 6435 [13.3%]), and other bacterial infections (2117 of 5482 [38.6%] vs 2618 of 6435 [40.7%]) (Table 1 and eTable 11 in the Supplement) was similar between the high- and low-dose groups. We observed modest differences in the proportion of patients with a recorded diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (472 of 5482 [8.6%] vs 758 of 6435 [11.8%]) (Table 1 and eTable 11 in the Supplement). After weighting, the 2 groups were balanced on all 147 variables, including the prescriber type, recorded indication for fluoroquinolone use (ie, urinary tract infection, community-acquired pneumonia, prosthetic joint infection, and other bacterial infections), comorbidities, baseline eGFR, and concurrent medications (eTable 11 in the Supplement).

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^2f039ed6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

In this multicenter pharmacokinetic study, the prescribed intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) did not adequately predict solute clearance, volume of distribution, half-life, or the saturation coefficient. This did not appear to be explained by the age of the filter, hematocrit, or serum albumin concentration.
Using urea and creatinine as biomarkers of membrane function, despite a correlation between effluent flow and clearance from hemodiafiltration (CL HDF), we detected failure of equilibration between dialysate and plasma during higher CRRT intensity.
The correlation between the saturation coefficient of urea or creatinine with antibiotics was inconsistent, limiting their role as a surrogate measures for clearance.
This variable pharmacokinetics complicates empiric antibiotic prescribing during CRRT, and ongoing research is required to determine factors that contribute to this variability.
In the meantime, drug monitoring may be the most practical method for ensuring that antibiotic therapeutic targets are achieved in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

### Treatment of influenza virus-related critical illness during continuous renal replacement therapy: take caution with dosing [^1a9e4364]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In their discussion, Chow et al. state that for patients who cannot tolerate or absorb enteric oseltamivir due to gastric stasis, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal processes, intravenous peramivir may be an alternative. They advise a single dose of 600 mg via intravenous infusion, given over 15–30 min. The question that arises is the following: what is the dose to be given during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)? According to the manufacturer's recommendations, the dose should be adjusted in line with the degree of reduction in creatinine clearance. In a recent case report by Dillon et al. a dose of 200 mg daily, the recommended dose for patients with creatinine clearance of 30–49 mL/min, was given to a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) managed with CRRT. In practice, as the plasma protein unbound fraction approaches 1 (as is the case with peramivir) and the molecular weight of the drug is low (below 20,000 Da), the sieving coefficient can be estimated to be 1. As a consequence, in this case report, the dosage scheme (200 mg daily) achieved a smaller serum peak concentration, larger volume of distribution, and a shorter half-life, illustrating the significant differences in pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment when drugs are administered in the setting of continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). Scheetz et al. recommend a steady-state concentration of 17,078 ng/mL, which was averaged from peak and trough concentrations in adult patients with normal renal function. Based on this recommendation, the patient reported by Dillon et al. would have required more than 800 mg given the CRRT settings. Doses of peramivir during CRRT vary from 200 to 800 mg per day in various case reports. This huge difference in dose will have a dramatic influence upon PK/PD during CRRT. Peramivir does not seem to possess any of the classic indications for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (i.e. narrow therapeutic index, high interpatient variability, high intrapatient variability) in patients with normal organ function. However, in patients with critical illness requiring extracorporeal therapies, TDM may provide useful information regarding pharmacokinetic variations and pharmacodynamic target attainment in order to avoid severe underdosing and treatment failure.

Results

The study selection chart is shown in Fig. 1. The literature search identified 193 potentially relevant articles, which were collected and checked against the eligibility criteria. Only 10 studies met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in Table 1. All studies were based on prospective data, and the papers comprised one congress presentation, five small case-series/case reports, three reports of observational studies and only one report of a randomized clinical trial.

Sixty-seven CRRT treatments were identified across the 10 selected studies; amongst these, 60 were treated with high-flux membranes and 3 with HCO membranes. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was the most frequent modality used (28 post-dilution, 4 pre-dilution over 67 treatments 47.8%), with prescribed effluent doses of 30–35 ml/kg/h. On the other hand, 29 treatments over 67 (43.3%) were performed with the continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) modality, and the remaining 6 with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) (6/67 patients, 8.9%), with a prescribed effluent dose of 30 ml/kg/h for CVVHD and 27.7–41.2 ml/kg/h for CVVHDF. Data from Mauro et al. were excluded because effluent dose values were considered too low [11.2 ml/kg/h]. All but two studies provided information on extracorporeal linezolid removal achieved during CRRT (see Table 1).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^85e99b66]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis antimicrobial dosing (Recommendation 12) — PK/PD optimization and monitoring: "We recommend using antimicrobial dosing strategies that have been optimized based on published pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic principles and with consideration of specific drug properties (BPS)." The document specifies efficacy determinants as "the time during which the concentration of the drug remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)… (T > MIC)," "the peak concentration to MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC)," and "the ratio of the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve divided by the MIC (AUC24/MIC)." In sepsis, "continuous or extended infusions with loading doses, as opposed to intermittent dosing, may lead to improved outcomes in patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics," and for vancomycin "continuous vancomycin infusions may be considered to achieve optimal concentrations in some patients." Drug-level guidance includes that "within 60 minutes before or after administration of aminoglycosides" measuring concentrations "to estimate the Cmin and Cmax… together with the MIC… can help to guide appropriate antimicrobial dosing." Dose optimization for concentration-dependent with time-dependent agents "involves adjusting the dosing interval rather than administered dose." The text highlights altered clearance with extracorporeal supports — "CRRT and ECMO both lead to profound alteration of antimicrobial clearance" — and that "Therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, can permit individualized antimicrobial dosing to achieve maximal effect while minimizing toxicity."

### The future of critical care: renal support in 2027 [^3d6e0cbc]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Management of fluid overload

Severe fluid overload continues to be a common trigger for CRRT initiation, especially in septic shock patients who have received aggressive volume resuscitation in the face of worsening renal function. A quantitative parameter of fluid accumulation, percent fluid overload (%FO), has been employed in many recent clinical trials and positive values have been associated with increased mortality, especially when > 10% at RRT initiation. In addition to septic AKI patients, postsurgical patients are also at high risk of developing severe fluid overload once AKI develops. Xu et al. found that a cumulative %FO ≥ 7.2% had a significant impact on 90-day outcome in critically ill AKI patients after cardiac surgery.

Even while approaches designed to assess fluid overload and quantify fluid responsiveness are refined, we predict that the occurrence of fluid overload as the primary trigger for CRRT initiation will increase over the next decade. The basis for this belief relates to the demographics of severe AKI, for which the primary cause will increasingly be severe sepsis and septic shock during this time. Thus, in conjunction with %FO (or similar measurement) and other clinical parameters, technologies providing real-time fluid assessment capabilities, including bioimpedance and ultrasound, will be used routinely by 2027.

Antibiotic dosing during CRRT

The increased prevalence of sepsis-associated severe AKI over the next decade will result in the need for antibiotic therapy in an increasingly greater percentage of CRRT patients. The lack of reliable clinical data to guide antibiotic use and the associated risk of under-dosing during CRRT have been identified as major problems — dosing continues to be done largely on an empiric basis (Table 1). Over the next decade, multiple clinical trials evaluating the antibiotics most commonly prescribed to CRRT patients will be performed. The typical range of CRRT flow parameters will be evaluated in these trials, along with commonly used filters, so that the contributions of diffusive, convective, and adsorptive clearance can be ascertained. These trials will provide relatively precise dosing recommendations for a series of widely used antibiotics, leading to the routine incorporation of this information into the CRRT prescription by clinicians.

### Machines that help machines to help patients: optimising antimicrobial dosing in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy using dosing software [^85cd998c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

ECMO is an advanced life support system which allows for prolonged cardiopulmonary support in patients with life-threatening respiratory or cardiac failure. ECMO does not provide treatment of the underlying illness, it is purely a supportive strategy that is implemented whilst underlying co-morbidities such as infection are treated.

Pharmacokinetic determinants during ECMO

In general, the ECMO circuit consists of a centrifugal blood pump, an oxygenator, heat exchanger and tubing. The ECMO circuit is primed with combination of crystalloid, albumin, and blood. Essentially, the addition of an ECMO circuit may further alter the PK in a critically ill patient in three ways: (1) sequestration of the drug by the ECMO circuit; (2) increasing the apparent V d; and (3) altered drug CL due to alteration in renal and liver blood flow, and altered plasma protein binding. The combined impact of ECMO- and critical illness-related factors on drug PK are summarised in Table 3. Importantly, drug dosing that does not consider these PK changes can lead to either therapeutic failure or toxicity.

### How to optimize drug delivery in renal replacement therapy [^0518595d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Drug dosing in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) is complicated by several factors such as pharmacokinetic changes in renal failure, inaccuracy of renal estimating equations in this setting, lack of therapeutic drug monitoring capability for most drugs, and use of extracorporeal renal replacement. Pharmacokinetic changes include decreases in protein binding and drug metabolism. Renal estimating equations most often overestimate renal clearance in AKI. Additionally, it is well recognized that some drugs are significantly cleared by extracorporeal therapy. Patients with AKI are therefore at risk for adverse outcomes of drug therapy. It has been reported that approximately half of patients with reduced renal clearance receive drug doses that are 2.5 times higher than the recommended maximum dose. To ensure efficacy and prevent toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring is highly recommended. However, in the absence of drug monitoring, adequate concentrations can only be inferred from clinical response. A clinician must weigh the risks and benefits of possible over-dosing or under-dosing based on the therapeutic index of the drug and the clinical situation. This article will review the important factors to consider for drug dosing in patients with AKI receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and sustained low-efficiency dialysis.

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^2dc0a228]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of multiple clinically relevant antibiotics administered to patients as part of a prospective multicenter observational study within a large randomized controlled trial. Multiple measurements were obtained, and similarities were observed between our data and the literature. Our data, however, greatly expand our understanding of CL, Vd, and pharmacokinetics in the setting of CRRT treatment using different CRRT doses and the advantages of randomization and multiple sampling.

Although median extracorporeal CL values were consistent with the literature, the degree of variability was an unexpected finding. All care was taken with the collection of samples by designated staff, subsequent storage, and then analysis using validated methods. However, we cannot exclude that this reflected unmeasured or unknown clinical or mechanical factors occurring during CRRT (for example, an undetected machine error at the time of sampling or a difference between the prescribed and delivered effluent flow rate); however, this also reflects clinical reality. The impact of these factors may have been reduced if clearance was determined from a prolonged collection (over hours) rather than at a point in time, as used in our study.

Our study might be underpowered to detect a true difference in clearance on the basis of CRRT intensity, relating in part, to the selection of patients. The dose ratio of lower- to higher-intensity CRRT effluent is 0.60 per protocol, but in this study the ratio was 0.76 based on the achieved median effluent flow rates. This may narrow the difference between the two groups, although this effect would be lessened by analysis in terms of the actual effluent production rate as performed here rather than according to milliliters per kilogram.
