## Question

37-year-old woman at routine checkup with occasional shortness of breath and an auscultated snap after S2 followed by a rumbling murmur best heard at the apex.

A 37-year-old woman presents to clinic for routine checkup. She has no complaints with the exception of occasional 'shortness of breath'.Her physical examination is unremarkable with the exception of a 'snap'-like sound after S2, followed by a rumbling murmur. You notice that this murmur is heard best at the cardiac apex. A history of which of the following are you most likely to elicit upon further questioning of this patient?

Answer Choices:
A. Hyperflexibility, vision problems, and pneumothorax
B. Systolic click auscultated on physical exam 10 years prior
C. Repeated episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis as a child
D. Cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which historical feature is most likely to be elicited in a 37-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea and a diastolic "opening snap" followed by a rumbling apical diastolic murmur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the auscultatory pattern and what it implies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the most likely diagnosis and its etiology. Next, I will review each answer choice against that diagnosis and decide which history best fits. Finally, I will confirm the reasoning with supporting evidence and note any pitfalls or exceptions I need to consider.

> Let me first confirm the auscultatory findings. An opening snap shortly after S2 followed by a low-pitched rumbling diastolic murmur at the apex is classic for mitral stenosis, with the snap reflecting abrupt tensing of the domed, thickened mitral valve leaflets and the murmur reflecting turbulent diastolic flow across a narrowed mitral orifice. Presystolic accentuation is common when sinus rhythm is present, though I should confirm rhythm rather than assume it [^82af923b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the most likely cause of mitral stenosis in a 37-year-old woman. Worldwide, rheumatic heart disease remains the predominant etiology of mitral stenosis, typically arising after repeated streptococcal pharyngitis in childhood, so a history of recurrent strep throat is highly relevant and mechanistically coherent with the current findings [^82af923b].

> Next, I should review the differential briefly to ensure I'm not missing a less likely mimic. Functional mitral stenosis from a left atrial myxoma can produce a "tumor plop" and diastolic murmur, but that would be a different historical context and less common than rheumatic disease in this age group, so I should keep it in mind but not let it derail the most likely diagnosis here [^34a711b8]. Similarly, congenital mitral stenosis exists but is less likely to present de novo at this age without prior detection, reinforcing rheumatic etiology as the leading consideration [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine each answer choice against this framework. Option A, hyperflexibility, vision problems, and pneumothorax, points toward connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome; while Marfan can involve the heart, the classic murmur here is not mitral stenosis but rather aortic regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse with a systolic click, so this does not match the diastolic opening snap and rumble, making A unlikely [^notfound]. Option B, a systolic click 10 years prior, suggests mitral valve prolapse; wait, let me verify the timing — MVP produces a systolic click, not a diastolic snap, so this timing mismatch makes B less likely to explain the current diastolic findings, even though MVP can coexist with rheumatic disease in some contexts [^notfound]. Option C, repeated streptococcal pharyngitis as a child, aligns perfectly with the pathogenesis of rheumatic mitral stenosis and is the most directly supportive historical clue for the observed auscultatory pattern [^82af923b]. Option D, cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm, is characteristic of carcinoid syndrome, which can cause valvular disease but typically leads to right-sided plaques and regurgitation rather than isolated mitral stenosis, so this constellation does not fit the left-sided diastolic murmur here [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking a congenital or degenerative cause that could present now. Given the patient's age and the classic rheumatic phenotype on exam, rheumatic heart disease remains the most probable etiology, and the history of recurrent streptococcal infections is the key historical discriminator that strengthens the pretest probability before confirmatory echocardiography [^82af923b].

> Conclusion: The most likely history to elicit is repeated episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis as a child, corresponding to option C, because this is the classic antecedent to rheumatic mitral stenosis, which explains the opening snap and rumbling apical diastolic murmur in this 37-year-old woman [^82af923b].

---

The most likely history to elicit is **repeated episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis as a child** (Option C), because the auscultatory findings of an opening snap followed by a rumbling apical diastolic murmur are classic for **mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease** [^82af923b], which typically follows recurrent streptococcal infections in childhood [^notfound]. The other options do not match this pathophysiology: Option A suggests Marfan syndrome (systolic murmur, not diastolic), Option B suggests mitral valve prolapse (systolic click, not diastolic snap), and Option D suggests carcinoid syndrome (right-sided valvular disease, not mitral stenosis).

---

## Clinical significance of the auscultatory findings

The opening snap followed by a rumbling apical diastolic murmur is **pathognomonic for mitral stenosis** [^82af923b], reflecting thickened, calcified valve leaflets that open abruptly in early diastole and create turbulent flow across the narrowed mitral orifice. This pattern is best heard at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope and is often accompanied by a loud S1 and presystolic accentuation when sinus rhythm is present [^82af923b].

---

## Etiology of mitral stenosis

Mitral stenosis is most commonly due to **rheumatic heart disease**, which results from an autoimmune response to group A streptococcal infection (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever) [^notfound]. Repeated episodes increase the risk of chronic valvular damage, particularly affecting the mitral valve [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Clinical correlation** | **Relevance to mitral stenosis** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Hyperflexibility, vision problems, and pneumothorax | Suggests Marfan syndrome (connective tissue disorder) | - Systolic murmur (mitral valve prolapse) <br/> - Not diastolic murmur |
| B. Systolic click auscultated on physical exam 10 years prior | Suggests mitral valve prolapse | - Systolic click <br/> - Not diastolic snap |
| C. Repeated episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis as a child | Strongly associated with rheumatic heart disease | - Directly linked to mitral stenosis <br/> - Classic history |
| D. Cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm | Suggests carcinoid syndrome | - Right-sided valvular disease <br/> - Not mitral stenosis |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely history to elicit is **repeated episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis as a child** (Option C), as this is the classic antecedent to rheumatic mitral stenosis [^notfound]. Confirm the diagnosis with **echocardiography** [^82af923b] and manage according to severity and symptoms, including antibiotic prophylaxis, anticoagulation if indicated, and consideration of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty or surgical intervention in severe cases.

Description

A previously healthy 29-year-old Mexican woman presented to an emergency department with transient hemiparaesthesias and dysarthria. There was no evidence of stroke on cross-sectional imaging of the head, and she was discharged without a clear diagnosis. Two days later, she returned with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal imaging revealed complete occlusion of the right renal artery, prompting emergency embolectomy. Following the procedure, she developed acute haemoptysis, dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Chest imaging demonstrated evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension. Cardiac auscultation revealed an opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. These sounds were better appreciated in combination with phonocardiography, a technique supplanted by echocardiography in the 1970sthat visualised heart sounds (video 1). An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of mitral stenosis (MS), unifying the syndrome of embolic phenomena, haemoptysis and pulmonary hypertension. She underwent successful mitral valve replacement and has since returned to normal activities.

Video 1
Audio of the heart sounds combined with phonocardiography (top phonocardiogram from a contemporary electronic stethoscope, bottom from a mid-20th century antique phonocardiograph), recorded over the apex of the heart demonstrating: (1) an abrupt, high amplitude S1, (2) an opening snap, (3) the low rumbling diastolic murmur of MS and (4) presystolic accentuation of the murmur.

Despite the advances in developed countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the most common cause of MS worldwide. Early manifestations include dyspnoea and fatigue, but occasionally embolic phenomena are part of the initial presentation. Definitive diagnosis can be made with echocardiography, but careful cardiac auscultation remains an important step in the diagnostic pathway when any of the following four signs are present: (1) pronounced S1, (2) early diastolic opening snap, (3) rumbling diastolic murmur at the apex using the bell and (4) presystolic accentuation of the murmur. In this case, phonocardiography was used to facilitate recognition of these signs.

Learning points

Mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease can present with embolic phenomena even in the absence of underlying atrial fibrillation.
Diastolic murmurs can be difficult to detect, but in the adult population carry a relatively narrow differential diagnosis of primarily aortic insufficiency and mitral stenosis.
Phonocardiography remains useful today as a learning tool to aid in the appreciation of heart sounds.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old woman with history of obesity, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE) and reported asthma presented with recurrent acute on chronic shortness of breath and associated fatigue that were refractory to her usual asthma treatment. Further inquiry highlighted history of chronic dry cough, palpitations, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and marked dyspnoea on exertion that significantly limited her functional capacity, with progression over the past year. She denied lower extremity swelling, pleuritic chest pain, sick contacts, fevers, night sweats, significant weight loss or specific triggers for her exacerbations. Physical examination was notable for mild sinus tachycardia and ambulatory desaturation. Pulmonary evaluation demonstrated symmetric chest rise, bibasilar fine crackles, without wheezing. Cardiac evaluation revealed no parasternal heave or displaced maximal impulse, a normal S1 and S2, a third heart sound initially thought to be a 'fixed split S2' and later considered as the 'tumour plop', and a low-grade diastolic murmur.

Clinical Introduction

An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman presented for prenatal counselling. She had a history of a heart murmur since childhood and a previous echocardiogram suggesting 'enlargement of the heart'. Physical exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and contour. Precordial palpation was unremarkable. Auscultation, however, was abnormal; findings on inspiration and expiration are presented in Figure 1, sound clip.

Question

Based on the phonocardiogram and online supplementary audio clip, which of the following is correct? An early diastolic filling sound (S3) is heard, indicating increased right ventricular filling pressures. An ejection click without respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. An ejection click with respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with pulmonic valve stenosis. A holosystolic murmur with inspiratory augmentation is heard, indicating tricuspid regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation — auscultatory clues distinguishing primary versus secondary MR: In primary MR, the presence of a diastolic filling complex (S3 plus short diastolic murmur) is usually associated with a significant regurgitant volume and severe MR, and one or more non‑ejection clicks may be audible. Differential radiation can suggest leaflet pathology, with murmurs from anterior leaflet flail directed to the axilla and left infrascapular area, whereas murmurs from posterior leaflet flail radiate anteriorly and can be confused with systolic ejection murmurs. With secondary MR, the murmur is usually best heard at the apex and radiates to the axilla, and an S3 gallop is harder to interpret because it may reflect underlying LV dysfunction.

### Unknown rheumatic cardiac disease as cause of acute onset post-partum dyspnea: a case report [^8d4cd998]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A foreign African black 28-year-old pregnant woman (3 previous gestations, 1 live birth, 1 abortion) with no previous chronic comorbidities was diagnosed with mild preeclampsia (de novo hypertension plus proteinuria) at 36 weeks of gestation. The patient had regular antenatal visits, no specific signs or symptoms related with previous cardiovascular disease, and the pregnancy evolved uneventfully until the 36 th week. Her obstetric history revealed a previous diagnosis of preeclampsia and preterm labor, with absence of a post-partum revision consultation to seek for underneath pathologies.

Labor was induced at 37 weeks with an uncomplicated eutocic delivery. Approximately 30 h after delivery, she presented chief complaint of increasing shortness of breath, and chest pressure. Patient also reported cough, orthopnea, and bilateral lower extremities oedema. She denied headaches, blurry vision, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills. During observation, she was in severe distress, restless, agitated, and using her accessory muscles of respiration. Vitals were recorded, which revealed normal temperature, tachycardia (120 bpm), tachypnea (28 cpm), and mild hypertension (143/86 mmHg). She had a peripheral oxygen saturation of 83%. Cardiac auscultation revealed tachycardia and a diastolic murmur more perceptible in the mitral area, and respiratory auscultation revealed fine crackles heard bilaterally with decreased basilar breathing sounds. Bilateral pitting pedal oedema was noted. Therefore, a multidisciplinary team approach with Obstetrics, Internal Medicine and Cardiology team was implemented.

Arterial blood gas analysis on Venturi mask 28% revealed pH of 7.46, carbon dioxide tension 33 mmHg, arterial oxygen tension 51 mmHg, bicarbonate 23.5 mmol/L, and arterial oxygen saturation of 88%. Routine blood investigations (full blood count, liver and kidney function tests, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, serum electrolytes, and urine analysis) were drawn. This pannel showed no abnormalities, besides mild leukocytosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was raised — 1011 pg/mL. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Serial 12 leads electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, with T-wave inversion in V1-V3. SARS-CoV2 Real Time-PCR was negative. A 2D bedside echocardiogram was performed revealing moderate dilated left atrium with severe mitral insufficiency suggestive of rheumatic disease, normal systolic function, and no other alterations.

### Catamenial pneumothorax: a case report and review of the literature [^5e70273d]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old woman presented with the chief complaint of right-sided chest pressure and shortness of breath with dry cough for 3 days. These symptoms coincided with the onset of her menstrual cycle. Her physical examination was significant for decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Her chest x-ray showed a moderate sized right pneumothorax extending from the apex to the lung base and a small amount of pleural fluid, findings that were verified by chest CT. The patient was seen by consultants from the pulmonary, obstetrics/gynecology, and thoracic surgery services, who agreed that the clinical diagnosis was catamenial pneumothorax, probably associated with thoracic endometriosis. The patient was discharged on levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets, which she opted not to take. Three months later, she had similar symptoms that occurred again at the time of menstruation. Her chest x-ray now showed a 10% right-sided pneumothorax. Catamenial pneumothorax is a rare condition affecting women in their reproductive years. Women with this condition most commonly have right-sided pneumothorax. The proper diagnosis is based on being aware of the existence of this relatively rare condition and relating the symptoms of pneumothorax temporally to the menses.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — current symptoms and signs: physical examination — define data elements and permissible values for documentation. Body mass index has permissible values of Numeric, kg/m^2 or Unknown. Third heart sound (S3) is recorded as presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound, and fourth heart sound (S4) as presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound, with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. Heart murmur status is captured as presence of heart murmur(s), and heart murmur timing is documented as Systolic, Diastolic, Continuous, or Other. Lung (pulmonary) examination findings specify findings on auscultation of the lungs with permissible values including Clear or normal, Rales, Decreased breath sounds or dullness, Rhonchi, Wheezing, Crepitations, Pleural friction rub, Absent breath sounds, and Other findings, with example permissible value definitions such as Lungs are normal on auscultation and Abnormal breath sounds (crackles) heard on auscultation indicating inflammation, fluid, or infection of the lung.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old woman presented to the ED with a nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and stridor. She was otherwise healthy and had never used tobacco. The patient was mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and saturating well on room air. She did not display any signs of increased work of breathing at rest. Although auscultation of her thorax indicated good air entry bilaterally without any adventitious sounds, stridor was elicited with forced expiration.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation… [^e242bc24]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

History A comprehensive history is critical for initiating an effective workup on a patient for dyspnea. The family physician should consider the duration of symptoms to establish chronicity, including fluctuation in symptoms, resulting functional limitations, worsening factors, relieving factors, medical and surgical history, social history, occupational history, age, history of tobacco use, and medication use. In patients with cardiac disease, a history of symptoms consistent with heart failure should be elicited.

Physical Examination The physical examination should start with a review of vital signs followed by an examination of the relevant body systems based on suspected diagnosis, including nasal and sinus tracts, oropharynx, neck, thorax, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, and skin. Pulsus paradoxus is associated with severe COPD, asthma, large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism, and subacute cardiac tamponade. 23 Neck examination may reveal a shift of the trachea, adenopathy, jugular venous distention, or an enlarged thyroid gland causing tissue congestion or mass effect giving rise to the sensation of dyspnea. Cyanosis, wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and distant heart sounds are consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, as are use of accessory muscles for respiration, a barrel chest, and decreased breath sounds with pursed lip breathing.

Rales, a positive hepatojugular reflex, hepatomegaly, and an S3 gallop, ascites, and jugular venous distention suggest heart failure as an underlying cause. An irregular rhythm on auscultation may indicate arrhythmias causative of chronic dyspnea. A musculoskeletal examination looking for indications of chest wall disease, such as severe kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, or ankylosing spondylitis, can identify restrictive elements causing dyspnea. Diminished chest wall excursion, dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, egophony, and a pleural friction rub are signs of pleural effusion; pallor of the skin and fingernails can be seen in chronic anemia.

### A 59-year-old woman with visible precordial pulsations [^6c5ad662]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical introduction

A retired 59-year-old woman presented to the cardiology clinic concerned with cardiac pulsations that were visible on her chest wall. These were not associated with dyspnoea, syncope or chest discomfort.

Of note, 8 years previously, she complained of recurrent nocturnal diaphoresis and 5 kg weight loss. Blood sampling at that time revealed a microcytic anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99 mm/hour, C-reactive protein 161 mg/L). Following an episode of transient diplopia, ophthalmoscopy demonstrated a cotton wool spot in the left inferotemporal retinal arcade. She commenced a 2-year tapering course of 1 mg/kg prednisolone.

On examination, she had a lean physique with a supine blood pressure of 162/60 mm Hg and palpable Corrigan's pulse. She had a prominent apical pulsation and a loud early diastolic murmur was present at the left sternal edge radiating to the apex. Echocardiography showed severe central aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (see online supplementary figure 1). Cardiac CT was performed to clarify the diagnosis (figure 1).

### Dyspnoea on exertion in a 53-year-old woman [^031bd972]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 53-year-old woman with no previous medical history complained of easy fatigue over the last 6 months. She had a positive family history for coronary artery disease but no other risk factors. On physical examination, a 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard over the apex, and the lung auscultation was unremarkable. Her ECG showed a left anterior fascicular block, with poor R wave progression in the anterior leads (see online supplementary image A). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a slightly dilated for the patient's body surface area (BSA) (1.73m 2) left ventricle (55/35mm), with preserved systolic function and a moderate functional mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 45mm Hg. During treadmill radionuclide scintigraphy, her exercise tolerance was normal, with good inotropic response, and 96% oxygen saturation at rest and at peak exercise. A 2mm ST segment depression was noted at peak effort, which persisted well into recovery (see online supplementary image B). The scintigraphy scan showed extensive reversible anteroapical wall ischaemia (see online supplementary image C). At this point she was referred to us for right and left heart catheterisation. Intracardiac pressures and saturations were: right atrium (RA)RA = 3mm Hg, right ventricle (RV) = 26/3mm Hg, Pulmonary artery (PA) = 26/10/mean 16mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) = 11mm Hg, left ventricle (LV) = 110/10mm Hg, Aorta (Ao) = 110/60/mean 80mm Hg, Superior vena cava saturation (SVCsat) = 62%, RAsat = 62%, PAsat = 78%, Aosat = 96%and estimated pulmonary to systematic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) = 1.8.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A retired 59-year-old woman presented to the cardiology clinic concerned with cardiac pulsations that were visible on her chest wall. These were not associated with dyspnoea, syncope or chest discomfort. Of note, 8years previously, she complained of recurrent nocturnal diaphoresis and 5kg weight loss. Blood sampling at that time revealed a microcytic anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99mm/hour, C-reactive protein 161mg/L). Following an episode of transient diplopia, ophthalmoscopy demonstrated a cotton wool spot in the left inferotemporal retinal arcade. She commenced a 2-year tapering course of 1mg/kg prednisolone. On examination, she had a lean physique with a supine blood pressure of 162/60mm Hg and palpable Corrigan's pulse. She had a prominent apical pulsation and a loud early diastolic murmur was present at the left sternal edge radiating to the apex. Echocardiography showed severe central aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (see online supplementary figure 1). Cardiac CT was performed to clarify the diagnosis (figure 1).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017-312193.supp1Supplementary file 1 heartjnl;104/3/273/F1F1F1Figure 1Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax at index presentation (A) and 6months (B).

### Haemorrhagiccomplex pericarditis presenting with cardiac tamponade in an immunocompetent woman [^31b98f3d]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

A young woman in her mid-40s with a medical history of hypertension presented with 10 days of a non-productive cough, worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness and pleuritic chest pain relieved by sitting up. She reported fevers of up to 103°F. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea but did admit to decreased appetite.

On examination, she was ill appearing but in no acute cardiopulmonary distress. Her pulse was regular but tachycardic. She had normal heart sounds with no rubs, murmurs or gallops. She had no jugular venous distension. The pulmonary examination was unremarkable. She had no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable. She was also normotensive, tachycardic up to 138 beats/min, afebrile and not hypoxic when evaluated in the emergency department.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A 14-year-old boy presented with history of decreased appetite and bilateral swelling of feet for 6 months. He did not give any associated history of orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He was born by a normal delivery after a non-consanguineous marriage. He had an unremarkable birth and childhood health history. There was no family history of significant cardiovascular illness or sudden death. Clinical examination showed an average built boy with elevated jugular venous pressure with prominent v wave and bilateral pitting pedal oedema. Cardiovascular examination showed normal first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds and a short early systolic murmur over tricuspid region. Other systems examination was remarkable for soft tender hepatomegaly.ECG showed sinus rhythm with tall, peaked p waves. Chest X-ray revealed enlargement along the right cardiac border. Transthoracic echocardiographic images are shown in figure 1A (apical four-chamber view) and figure 1B (tricuspid inflow Doppler).

### Case report: the management for a gestational hypertensive woman with influenza A virus pneumonia and peripartum cardiomyopathy [^0f106cd3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old woman (gravida 7, para 4) at 40 weeks and 1 day of gestation was referred from a maternity clinic to our emergency department (ED) because of progressive dyspnea. She weighed 74 kg and was 160 cm tall, with no systemic disease including cardiovascular disease, previous medical or surgical diseases of note. The patient reported experiencing muscle aches and fatigue for a week, which she initially attributed to pregnancy. Three days prior to ED admission, she developed a dry cough, shortness of breath and orthopnea that persisted to admission. In the ED, her blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were 162/118 mmHg, 84 beats/minute, and 26 breaths/minute, respectively. Intravenous trandate 5 mg was administered to control blood pressure. The body temperature was 37.2 °C. Despite the administration of supplemental oxygen (5 L/min) via a nasal cannula, her pulse oxygen saturation level remained at 91%, with a high of 93%. Examination revealed tachypnea, an appearance of breathlessness while lying flat, and systemic edema in the feet and ankle in particular. Coarse crackles breathing sounds were heard from both lungs on auscultation. Biochemical tests were unremarkable (Alanine transaminase: 10 IU/L, Aspartate transaminase: 18 IU/L, Prothrombin time: 10.5 secs, Activated partial thromboplastin time: 28 secs, Blood urea nitrogen: 10.2 mg/dL, Creatinine: 0.41 mg/dL) and absent of proteinuria in a urine test. Blood data showed a mildly elevated white cell count (9,400 /µL), while C-reactive protein was 0.746 mg/dL (normal < 0.5 mg/dL). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with a nonspecific ST-T segment. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and patchy opacities (multifocal consolidations) consistent with pulmonary edema (Fig. 1). She followed our advice of an emergency cesarean delivery, which was given out of concern for her deteriorating condition and the futility of planning a vaginal birth for a woman of nearly postterm pregnancy.

### Pulmonary oedema mimicking bronchiectasis [^37c67ba6]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A previously completely fit and well 62-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of lethargy and increasing shortness of breath. This had been preceded by a flu-like illness that had been treated in the community with ciprofloxacin to no effect. There was no history of smoking, tuberculosis exposure or significant exposure to birds. Clinically the patient appeared well and was comfortable and conversant with no peripheral oedema. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds and a loud pansystolic murmur over the cardiac apex. A chest radiograph and a subsequent CT scan showed widespread fibrotic and bronchiectatic changes, predominantly in the right upper lobe, with bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography revealed a posterior mitral valve prolapse. He was treated with loop diuretics and a mitral valve repair that resolved his symptoms and radiographic findings. This is the first English language case report of pulmonary oedema causing bronchiectatic lung appearances.

### Shortness of breath in a 38-year-old woman with pulmonary and hepatic nodules [^e7d33807]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old African American woman with a history of menometrorrhagia on previous estrogen therapy and a previously biopsied benign thyroid nodule with recent interval enlargement presented with symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion, an intermittent nonproductive cough, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 1 year. She denied wheezing, hemoptysis, fevers, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. Socially, the patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and denied alcohol or drug use. Travel history was not significant, and she had no contributory occupational, environmental, or animal exposures. Recent cancer screening that included Papanicolaou smear and mammography were negative for neoplasia. Vital signs were normal, and ambulatory pulse oximetry did not demonstrate evidence of oxygen desaturation. Physical examination demonstrated normal respiratory effort, diffuse vesicular breath sounds, and a soft abdomen without hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant tenderness.

### Trastuzumab (herceptin)-associated cardiomyopathy presented as new onset of complete left bundle-branch block mimicking acute coronary syndrome: a case report and literature review [^4fb77e39]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is well documented in reducing suffering and mortality from breast cancer. The clinically most important side effect of Herceptin is cardiotoxicity, which is reported in 2.6% to 4.5% of patients receiving trastuzumab alone and in as many as 27% of patients when trastuzumab is combined with an anthracycline in metastatic disease. We reported the case of a 50-year-old woman who presented to our emergency department (ED) because of chest pain and shortness of breath. On physical examination, holosystolic murmur over apex could be heard. Pulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and new onset of complete left bundle-branch block. Emergent transthoracic echocardiography revealed generalized hypokinesia of left ventricle and akinesia over interventricular septum and apex. She subsequently underwent immediate coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary angiography, and left ventriculogram revealed generalized hypokinesia with severe left ventricle dysfunction with ejection fraction of 33%. During right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy, cardiac tamponade developed and was successfully relieved by pericardial window. She was discharged event-free 3 weeks later with conservative treatment. Although new onset of complete left bundle-branch block in a patient with chest pain may be acute coronary syndrome, careful review of medicine history is mandatory to avoid unnecessary procedure and complications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, or a mitral regurgitation murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism is associated with tachycardia and dyspnea in > 90% of patients and pain with inspiration. In suspected aortic dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10% and aortic regurgitation (AR) 40%–75% (type A) are noted among findings. Esophageal rupture can present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax (20% patients) with unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Other causes include pericarditis with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and friction rub; myocarditis with fever, chest pain, heart failure, S3; pneumothorax with dyspnea and pain on inspiration and unilateral absence of breath sounds; costochondritis with tenderness of costochondral joints; and herpes zoster with pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch and a characteristic rash.

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: a simplified approach to next steps [^40f968e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 2: A 42‐year‐old woman with a 20 pack‐year history of smoking presents to the clinic with an episode of syncope in the setting of progressively worsening shortness of breath over the last few months and symptoms consistent with Raynaud disease. Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph are unremarkable. Echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular size and function, severely dilated right ventricle, severe right ventricular dysfunction with a TAPSE of 11 mm, small pericardial effusion, and an estimated PASP of 60 mm Hg.

The similarities between this case and case 1 end with the significantly elevated PASP on echocardiography. The young age of this patient alone would make PH‐LHD unlikely. However, she does have risk factors (smoking) that would prompt consideration for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). It is important to remember that the prevalence of PH in COPD is dependent on the severity of disease and requires quantification. Patients with a history of smoking (or oxygen dependency) often get labeled with COPD without formal evaluation with pulmonary function testing. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1–3 do not usually cause significant PH. In fact, 90% of patients with GOLD stage 4 COPD have mean PAP > 20 mm Hg, most ranging between 20 and 35 mm Hg, with only 1% to 5% of patients with COPD manifesting mean PAP > 35 to 40 mm Hg at rest. 54

Clinical introduction

A 57-year-old woman nursing home patient with diabetes, hypertension, and a prior haemorrhagic stroke presented to our emergency department with progressive dyspnoea, cough with white sputum and low-grade temperature. On arrival, the patient was tachypnoeic, using accessory muscles and oxygen desaturation was noted. Physical examination showed no jugular vein engorgement, trachea was not deviated and auscultations revealed bilateral equal breath sounds with bi-basilar rales. Despite supplemental oxygen, the patient required intubation and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, in the ICU, the patient's saturation continued to fluctuate despite varying ventilation settings. The postintubation X-ray is shown (figure 1).

### A 73-year-old man with shortness of breath, edema, and weight gain [^e0d32bef]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 73-year-old man who sought evaluation for 1 month of shortness of breath, bilateral lower-extremity edema, and weight gain of 14kg. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Pulmonary valve endocarditis caused by right ventricular outflow obstruction in association with sinus of valsalva aneurysm: a case report [^62038f70]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old man with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus was admitted to the local community hospital for a six-week history of low grade fever and recent development of chills and shortness of breath on October, 2005. Prior to this admission, the patient had been treated as an outpatient by his primary care physician for possible sinusitis and pneumonia with three different kinds of oral antibiotics including levofloxacin. On admission, the patient had a fever of 37 degrees centigrade and elevated white cell count of 17 × 10 9 /L. Physical examination was significant for a hyperdynamic precordium, 2+ parasternal lift, grade 2–3 out of 6 continuous murmur best heard at the left sternal boarder, and gallop at the apex. The chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion and features consistent with congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram showed a markedly dilated sinus of Valsalva, measuring at least 6.4 cm, with turbulent blood flow in a RVOT. This was felt to possibly represent a left-to-right shunt and the possibility of a ruptured sinus of Valsalva was raised. The echocardiogram also showed a vegetation on one of the pulmonary valve leaflets (figure 1). The patient was subsequently treated empirically for infective endocarditis with vancomycin and gentamycin for 28 days. During cardiac catheterization, oximetry studies showed there was no step-up in saturation in the pulmonary valve. This made the presence of a significant left-to-right shunt less likely. Aortic injection revealed significant dilation of all of the coronary sinuses. There was no jet noted from the coronary sinus to the right side of the chamber. Minimal aortic regurgitation was present. Pulmonary artery injection showed mild pulmonary insufficiency. Blood cultures did not grow any organisms.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^3b3bd3fc]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Parameters

The timings, the intensities and the frequency contents of the sounds were manually extracted from the phono-spectrogram using the software's graphical measurement tools (see any of the Figures from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). First, the whole recording is listened to carefully. The locations of S1 and S2 are recognized from the graphical presentation showing a moving marker over the phono-spectrogram during replaying. Then, a shorter interesting area containing three whole heart cycles is selected by zooming the signal. The timings are read from the time-scale (at the bottom) by graphically studying both the phonocardiogram and the spectrogram, deciding the duration of the sound events and dragging the marker over the selected time segment. The intensities of S1, S2 and the murmur are read from the scale (on the right) by moving the marker with the mouse over the phonocardiogram. The loudness of the murmur was estimated from the phonocardiogram by comparing the maximum amplitude of the murmur to the average value of the maximum first and second heart sounds Finally, the frequencies in Hertz are read by moving the marker over the spectrogram. The typical intensity for the high and low frequency limits of the systolic murmurs was around -45–50 dB.

Figure 1
Innocent vibratory murmur in a 7-year-old. On auscultation, the typical early and midsystolic low-vibrating murmur is best heard at the left fourth intercostal space and the apex (S1 = First heart sound, S2 = Second heart sound, SM = Systolic Murmur). The phonogram shows a rising and falling early-to-midsystolic murmur, and the spectrogram shows a typical dense configuration and a descending frequency with a maximum gradient of approx. 150 Hz. The auscultation area was the left fourth intercostal space (LIC4). Duration 56%, peak frequency 149 Hz and volume 32%.

Figure 2

The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs: BP, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats/min; oxygen saturation, 98% on ambient air; and respiratory rate, 13 breaths/min. Breathing was normal without accessory muscle use, cyanosis, or clubbing. Lung examination indicated symmetrical expansion, normal vocal vibration transmission, resonant percussion, and no abnormal sounds on auscultation. Cardiac assessment showed no apex displacement, murmurs, or thrills, and there was no jugular vein distention or peripheral edema. Ear, nose, and throat examination results were normal, with no signs of edema, hemorrhage, or abnormalities. Peripheral lymph nodes were unremarkable, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.

### When your patient clicks: a loud clicking sound as a key sign to the diagnosis [^c8c9eee7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old male patient was referred by his general practitioner with a new 'cardiac murmur'. For 1week, he had been able to provoke a clicking sound, which was in time with his heart beat and originated from his chest. The physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. The sound was initially interpreted as most likely due to a valve condition such as mitral valve prolapse, but a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. A cardiac CT was obtained, which showed left-sided ventral pneumothorax. The Hamman's sign is a loud precordial pulse synchronous sound, which is often postural. It is pathognomonic for left-sided pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Hamman's sign as a presenting symptom is rare, but if present is key to diagnosis. The awareness of rare clinical findings is important and will prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### An unusual finding in a 57-year-old woman with new onset hypertension and a diastolic murmur [^e2e648e9]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical introduction

A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with breathlessness brought on while walking uphill. She had been recently diagnosed with systemic hypertension. There was no known family history of cardiac disease, or prior smoking habit. On examination, pulse was 73 bpm and blood pressure 155/73 mm Hg, which was asymmetrical in her arms. Auscultation revealed a readily audible early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and bilateral subclavian bruits. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular size and function. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated (41 mm), with para-aortic thickening noted. Owing to the abnormal appearance of the aortic wall, cardiac MRI, and subsequently 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed (figure 1).

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^2f1c542e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) clinical presentation — most encountered cases, symptom progression, and examination findings are described as follows: Most TR cases clinically encountered are secondary in nature and not related to primary diseases of the valve leaflets or chordae, such as infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid, and Ebstein anomaly. Mild-to-moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated in the short to intermediate term and may be clinically silent, but with increasing TR severity, symptoms of systemic venous congestion, such as edema and those reflective of reduced forward cardiac output, including dyspnea and fatigue, may emerge, and more advanced manifestations of right-sided congestion, such as abdominal bloating, worsening peripheral edema, weight gain, and anorexia, are ominous. Most patients with chronic severe secondary TR are older and have a significant burden of other cardiac and systemic comorbidities, and women outnumber men in most large observational series and atrial fibrillation (AF) is common. TR on bedside physical examination is more often "seen" than "heard," with severe TR showing elevated venous pressure and a prominent, systolic cv wave with a rapid y descent (in the absence of tricuspid stenosis), and the murmur of chronic TR being holosystolic in timing, high or medium pitched, and best heard at the lower left sternal border. An increase in murmur intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign) can help distinguish it from other holosystolic murmurs, but when right atrial (RA) pressure is very high the murmur may not increase with inspiration, and in rare severe TR a diastolic murmur of functional tricuspid stenosis owing to enhanced diastolic flow can be appreciated.

Case 1

Our first patient, a 33-year-old primigravida with a twin pregnancy, presented herself in the emergency department during the 5th gestational week (GW) due to occasional palpitations, chest pain and shortness of breath during rest (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Flowchart of the first parturient with ascending aortic aneurysm

As the physical and obstetric examinations, all laboratory findings, and the chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were normal, the patient was referred for transthoracic ultrasound (US). This assessment took place a few days later and showed a bicuspid aortic valve along with an ascending aorta aneurysm measuring 46 mm in diameter. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed with magnetic resonance angiography of the thoracic aorta conducted during the 8th GW (Fig. 2 A).

Case presentation

A 67-year-old woman presented with progressive shortness of breath and bilateral legs edema for 3 weeks. In addition, generalized pruritus and poor appetite were noted. She reported no obvious decrease in urine output. Her medical history included untreated diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She denied use of Chinese herbs and pain killers recently. She denied fever, chest pain, abdominal pain or tarry stool.

Upon arrival to the ED, she was oriented and her vital signs were as followings: a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 198/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18, body temperature of 37 °C and oxygen saturation of 97% in room air. Chest auscultation revealed crackles at both bases without heart murmurs or friction rubs. Pitting edema over bilateral lower limbs up to the knees was noted. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The laboratory data revealed marked elevated level of serum creatinine (548 μmol/L) and blood urea (35 mmol/L). Urine analysis revealed presence of proteinuria (3+ at the dipstick) but serum albumin (32 g/L) was not obviously reduced. Arterial blood gas showed metabolic acidosis. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltage QRS (Fig. 1 a), and chest X-ray revealed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (Fig. 1 b). PoCUS was applied and included assessments of lung, heart and inferior vena cava (IVC). Sonography disclosed a large amount of pericardial effusion without right ventricle collapse sign (Fig. 2 a), normal lung sliding signs with one B line (Fig. 2 b) and mildly distended IVC (Fig. 2 c).

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not." A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

Considerations for older patients with chest pain — COR 1 (LOE C-LD) specifies that in patients with chest pain who are ≥ 75 years of age, ACS should be considered when accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, syncope, or acute delirium are present, or when an unexplained fall has occurred. Increased age is a significant risk factor for ACS, and although patients > 75 years of age account for 33% of all cases of ACS, alternative diagnoses are still more common than a cardiac cause of chest pain at presentation. A substudy of the PROMISE trial has shown that patients ≥ 75 years of age with stable symptoms suggestive of CAD are more likely to have a positive noninvasive test and more coronary artery calcification than younger people, and for these older patients, when compared with anatomic noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD with cardiac CT, a positive stress test result was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death or MI. Patients > 75 years of age may have symptoms of shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or experienced an unexplained fall, and the physician should have a heightened awareness to understand that these symptoms may be associated with ACS, in addition to chest pain.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or cyanosis, and peripheral pulses were symmetrical and palpable. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and normal chest expansion. The gastrointestinal examination was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no organomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination revealed no chest wall tenderness, and the thoracic cage appeared normal. The patient had a full range of motion in the upper limbs, with no evidence of joint or muscle abnormalities. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with intact cranial nerves and normal motor and sensory functions.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for dyspnea at rest and fatigue. Her symptoms had increased gradually during the few weeks before admission. She also had nausea, poor appetite, and palpitation. In her past medical history, a history of controlled asthma with inhaled corticosteroids was present for ten years. Her habitual history was unremarkable. In physical examination, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, heart rate was 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 30 per minute, oral temperature was 36.7 C, and oxygen saturation was 96% in room air. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) was elevated, and a systolic murmur was heard in the lower left sternal border and cardiac apex. Breath sounds were reduced in the basal parts of the lungs. Bilateral lower limb pitting edema was detected in both legs.

In the initial lab data, complete blood count (CBC) with differential was as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) level was 12.7 g/dl, platelet count was 109,000 × 10 9 /L, and white blood cell (WBC) count was 13,500 × 10 9 /L mm3 with the Neutrophils and lymphocytes percentages equal to 49% and 12%, respectively. The eosinophil count was significantly high (4185 × 10 9 /L, 31% of WBCs). Chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion. Pleural fluid analysis showed a protein level of 1200 mg/dl, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 297 U/L, and an albumin level of 800 mg/dl. Simultaneous blood sampling showed a serum LDH level of 558 U/L, a serum total protein level of 6.4 g/dl, and a serum albumin level of 3.6 g/dl. The results were in favor of a transudate effusion. Spirometry was performed based on the history of asthma, which showed a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of 37%, a forced vital capacity of 39%, and an FEV1 to FVC ratio of 92%. The pattern was in favor of mixed obstructive and restrictive airway disease.

### Acute mitral valve regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture due to infective endocarditis [^2ff19987]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with shortness of breath exacerbated by exertion. Additional complaints included fever and productive cough. Vital signs were remarkable for tachycardia and oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters of nasal cannula. On physical examination the patient was in no apparent distress. Rales were heard on chest auscultation and cardiac exam was significant for a 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Blood work was significant for elevated white blood cell count. Chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiac catheterization revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severe mitral valve regurgitation with a posteriorly directed eccentric jet, and follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a flail anterior mitral valve leaflet (AMVL) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Mitral valve imaging. Flail anterior mitral valve leaflet is seen on transesophageal echocardiogram (A) with evidence of a posteriorly directed regurgitant jet (blue) on transthoracic echocardiogram (B)

The patient was admitted for medical optimization and planned surgical intervention due to acute heart failure secondary to severe mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures showed Staphylococcus haemolyticus growth. After adequate medical optimization, the patient was taken to the operating room for surgical management of the mitral valve.

The operation was done via a mini right thoracotomy incision made through the fourth intercostal space and cardiopulmonary bypass was achieved via left femoral cannulation. Excellent exposure of the mitral valve was achieved through Sondergaard's groove. Examination of the mitral valve showed maximal prolapse at the A3 region of the AMVL due to complete detachment of the corresponding papillary muscle. The mitral valve and papillary muscle were resected en bloc and sent for culture and pathology (Fig. 2). The mitral valve was replaced with a 31 mm St. Jude Medical Epic™ bioprosthetic valve (St. Jude Medical, Inc. MN, USA). The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

### Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery in a 62 ‑ year ‑ old woman: a case report and review of the literature [^10fa4a77]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms

Our patient presented with chest pain while walking, which improved with rest. She also reported chest pain that did not respond to medication. Patients with coronary artery anomalies exhibit various symptoms, the most common being chest pain. Other symptoms include shortness of breath and syncope. In some cases, patients are asymptomatic, leading to sudden death. Studies indicate that only 20% of patients present with symptoms such as angina induced by exertion, shortness of breath, or syncope, while the majority remain asymptomatic. It is crucial to consider warning signs such as chest pain and syncope, especially in young individuals during physical activity and sports, as these symptoms could indicate conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, and coronary artery anomalies. Given the non-specific nature and wide range of symptoms associated with coronary artery anomalies, evaluating patients with various symptoms, particularly younger individuals, is essential.

Gender and age

Our patient is a 62-year-old woman. In a review of existing studies, out of 16 reported cases, 15 were men and only 5 were women. The oldest individual reported was an 81-year-old man. Most cases of sudden death occurred in individuals under 20 years old, with clinical manifestations typically following intense physical exercise. Only two cases of cardiac arrest in older individuals have been reported, one of whom was a known CHF patient. No definitive correlation between gender and age with coronary artery anomalies has been reported, indicating the need for further studies to better understand the impact of gender on these anomalies.

Changes in ECG and exercise test

In our case study, the patient presented with exertional chest pain that was unresponsive to medical treatment, while her ECG showed normal findings without any ischemic changes or evidence of myocardial infarction. Studies on ECG findings in symptomatic patients revealed various changes ranging from normal to bundle branch block and ST elevation. Additionally, cardiac arrest was reported as a variable symptom. The exercise stress tests performed in only four cases were all reported as positive. Despite a negative exercise test in our patient, she continued to experience chest pain during activity despite medical management, prompting the decision to proceed with angiography.

It is important to note that specific ECG changes indicative of coronary artery anomalies is not always present. Even in studies where patients had normal ECGs, anomalies were detected. Therefore, relying solely on ECG and exercise test results may not be sufficient. If symptoms persist, further comprehensive evaluations are necessary to detect coronary artery anomalies promptly and prevent irreversible complications.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable," with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)," implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak," with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action," implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role."

### Unusual cause of dyspnoea: a case presentation of an echocardiographic pitfall [^19cb8e2d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The causes for new occurrence of dyspnoea are manifold. However, especially cardiologists are confronted with echocardiographic findings more and more often, which are not common in routine daily work – on the one hand due to the increasing age of the population and the associated increasingly recurring cardiac defects which often require surgery and on the other hand due to successfully remediated congenital cardiac defects originated in the early childhood with now normal expectancy of life.

We report the case of a patient who early after aortic valve replacement felt recurring dyspnoea and showed signs of cardiac decompensation.

A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was admitted with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath of 3 days duration. Her heart rate was 89 bpm, blood pressure 105/70 mmHg, and temperature 36.5 °C. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. On admission, blood tests revealed Hb 10.9 g/dl, troponin I 5.26, CK-MB 4 ng/ml. Arterial blood gas revealed pH 7.32, pCO 2 21.6, pO 2 80.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 11 mmol/l and SaO 2 92.8% on room air. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation and Q waves in leads V1-4 and coronary catheterization revealed total proximal occlusion of the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. Angioplasty and stent implantation were performed, and chest pain, shortness of breath, and general malaise disappeared after the procedure. However, the day after angioplasty and stenting, the patient suddenly experienced fatigue, dyspnea, and tachycardia. At this time, her blood pressure was 70/50 mmHg and heart rate 120 bpm. On physical examination, auscultation revealed a 3/6 pan-systolic murmur in the left parasternal area.

### Primary mitochondrial disease as a rare cause of unclear breathlessness and distinctive performance degradation-a case report [^abed09cb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of unclear exertional dyspnea with extreme functional limitation.

She had experienced breathing difficulties and performance limitations since early childhood. A medical examination at 6 years of age had shown tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a normal electrocardiogram. Subsequently, her symptoms had worsened and she had developed severe pain and increasing weakness in her leg muscles. At 15 years of age, she was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma. At 16 years of age, she underwent low-stress ergometry, which caused a sharp increase in heart rate there (a sharp increase in already at 20 watts from 100 to 160/min and at 60 watts to 200/min) with extreme shortness of breath. In CPET (bicycle, 3 min at 25 watts followed by 3 min at 50 watts), the respiratory quotient at rest was 1.02 and oxygen uptake (VO 2) increased from 1.76 ml/min/kg to a maximum of 13.8 ml/kg/min. Echocardiography showed mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, which declined after 3 years of beta-blocker therapy. She was not under beta-blocker therapy when referred to our department.

A tension pneumothorax represents a medical emergency warranting urgent diagnosis and treatment. A rapidly expanding bulla may resemble the same clinical presentation but requires an entirely different treatment. A 53-year-old woman presented with increasing shortness of breath and her physical examination and chest x-ray were interpreted as showing a tension pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed which did not resolve the process. Placement of a second chest tube was likewise unsuccessful. A chest CT was then performed and was interpreted as showing an unresolved tension pneumothorax, despite seemingly adequate placement of the 2 chest tubes. Further review of the CT showed the border of a giant bulla and a tentative diagnosis was made of a rapidly expanding bulla with tension physiology. Echocardiogram revealed significant pulmonary hypertension. The bulla was surgically excised, the patient had marked improvement in her clinical symptoms and signs, and echocardiographic follow-up showed complete resolution of the pulmonary hypertension.

### Tension pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19 [^63b59687]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 36-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19, following a 3-week history of cough, fevers and shortness of breath, worsening suddenly in the preceding 4hours. On presentation he was hypoxaemic, with an SpO 2 of 88% on 15L/min oxygen, tachycardic and had no audible breath sounds on auscultation of the left hemithorax. Local guidelines recommended that the patient should be initiated on continuous positive airway pressure while investigations were awaited, however given the examination findings an emergency portable chest radiograph was performed. The chest radiograph demonstrated a left-sided tension pneumothorax. This was treated with emergency needle decompression, with good effect, followed by chest drain insertion. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated lung re-expansion, and the patient was admitted to a COVID-19 specific ward for further observation. This case demonstrates tension pneumothorax as a possible complication of suspected COVID-19 and emphasises the importance of thorough history-taking and clinical examination.

### A 50-year old woman with recurrent right-sided chest pain [^aba0684f]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old woman was seen in the office for recurrent episodes of cough and right-sided chest pain. She had visited the ED three times in the past 15 months for the same complaint. Each time, the pain started gradually affecting the right lateral chest wall. It was pleuritic and was associated with cough and mild shortness of breath. During these episodes, she reported low-grade fever but denied any night sweats, chills, sputum production, wheezing, or hemoptysis. She was treated with antibiotics and systemic steroids with resolution of her symptoms. The patient was an active smoker with a more than 35-pack year history. She had no known medical condition and was not taking any medication routinely at home. She had no family history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or Marfan syndrome.

### ACR practice parameter for communication of diagnostic imaging findings [^f9032ab0]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

Communication and imaging requests — communication of information is only as effective as the system that conveys the information, and a request for imaging should include relevant clinical information, including pertinent signs and symptoms; in addition, including a specific question to be answered can be helpful, and such information helps tailor the most appropriate imaging study to the clinical scenario and enhances the clinical relevance of the report.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^7750bdcf]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Typical patterns of symptom presentation in women describe differences in symptom triggers and descriptors compared with men; the most common presentation of myocardial ischemia is chest pain or discomfort; however, women have a different pattern and distribution of non–chest-related pain symptoms, and women's ischemic symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently by physical exertion; proportionately, women more often report epigastric discomfort and associated nausea; radiation of discomfort to the arms, neck, and interscapular areas; and dyspnea and fatigue; studies have not found a pattern of symptoms uniquely ascribed to either sex, but significant overlap in qualitative descriptors exists, and the evidence synthesis highlights that women experience a broad range of symptoms, frequently including recent and stress-related symptoms.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^5db5fc98]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ESMO 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that the kinetics of response to early treatment steps is also well recognized as a prognostic factor, obtained through different methodologies and at different treatment times, ranging from pre-phase therapy (prednisone response) to induction day 8–15 (marrow blast cell clearance), end of induction (time to complete remission, minimal residual disease) and post-induction phase.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^352f5634]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, PEEP targets, ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine PEEP titration with a higher PEEP/FiO2 strategy versus a lower PEEP/FiO2 strategy to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS,
including due to COVID-19.

### Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiogenic shock [^bd291131]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old female patient with prior medical history of HIV, syphilis and cerebrovascular accident, presented herself to the coronary care unit with chest pain, near syncope and malaise. Furthermore, the patient was recently exposed to greater emotional distress. At presentation, the vital parameters were: blood pressure: 82/53 mm Hg, pulse rate: 81 beats/min (bpm), breathing frequency: 21/min with oxygen saturation: 94% with 3 L/min oxygen supply. Physical examination revealed a loud holosystolic murmur and bibasilar pulmonary rales.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^11432442]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — manuscript development and committee review states that once agreed upon by the full committee, the final recommendations are used as the framework for manuscript development by the writing team, and the supporting text includes a synopsis of the available evidence to support the recommendations, short statements on patients' values and preferences, the balance of benefits and harms, and special health equity or implementation considerations where relevant. Once reviewed and verified by the writing team, the manuscript is reviewed and discussed by the Committee on Clinical Consensus during a scheduled meeting, and a final manuscript, incorporating changes from discussion, is reviewed and approved by the Committee on Clinical Consensus before additional consideration from other internal review bodies.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in elective colorectal surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: 2018 [^21d12cc0]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to surgical approach (ERASS), ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend to prefer a minimally invasive approach to colon and rectal cancer for improved and more rapid recovery, reduced general complications, reduced wound-related complications, including incisional hernia, and fewer adhesions, as well as to enable for successful administration of many of the major components of enhanced recovery after surgery, such as opioid-sparing analgesia and optimized fluid therapy.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.
