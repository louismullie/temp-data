## Question

What dose of DHEA-S is required to achieve a meaningful level in postmenopausal women with sexual disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dose of DHEA-S is needed to achieve a meaningful level in postmenopausal women with sexual disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and clarify DHEA versus DHEA-S and which form is actually supplemented. Then, I should define what "meaningful" means biochemically versus clinically. Next, I will examine dose–response data for oral systemic DHEA on serum hormones. After that, I need to check randomized trial outcomes for hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Then, I will review local intravaginal DHEA for dyspareunia and systemic exposure. Finally, I should synthesize whether any DHEA/DHEA-S target or dose is recommended, and if not, outline evidence-based alternatives and safety considerations [^114k8LiV].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic terminology, because precision matters here. Wait, let me verify that trials actually give DHEA and not DHEA-S; yes, clinical studies supplement oral DHEA, which is rapidly converted in the liver and periphery to DHEA-S and downstream androgens and estrogens, whereas DHEA-S itself is the long-lived circulating reservoir and is not the form given in standard supplementation trials in this context [^114k8LiV] [^116FNw2S].

> I need to define what "meaningful level" implies. Biochemically meaningful would mean a dose that produces a significant increase in serum testosterone, estradiol, or DHEA-S, whereas clinically meaningful would require measurable improvement in sexual function outcomes such as desire, satisfying sexual events, or distress reduction; hold on, I should confirm that the literature separates these, and indeed meta-analytic data show biochemical increases with DHEA while separate syntheses and trials often fail to show clinical sexual function benefit in women with normal adrenal function [^116bnzzy] [^114LPJZF].

> Next, I should review dose–response for oral DHEA on serum hormones. I will now examine whether there is a threshold dose that consistently raises androgens and estrogens; multiple meta-analyses of randomized trials indicate that doses at or above 50 mg/day significantly increase total testosterone and estradiol on average, whereas doses below 50 mg/day generally do not produce significant changes in these hormones across pooled datasets [^111sGvFu] [^111jPPZk]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought lower doses might suffice, but subgroup analyses repeatedly show that the significant effects concentrate at 50 mg/day or higher with modest absolute estradiol rises and about 20–30 ng/dL increases in testosterone on average, confirming a biochemical threshold at ≥ 50 mg/day in postmenopausal cohorts [^116bnzzy] [^111jPPZk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that biochemical change equals clinical benefit. I need to check whether oral DHEA at those doses improves low desire or sexual function; the pivotal randomized trial of 50 mg/day for postmenopausal women with low libido showed no improvement versus placebo in satisfying sexual events or validated sexual function scales, despite androgen increases and with more androgenic side effects like acne and hirsutism, and systematic reviews and consensus statements conclude that oral DHEA does not significantly improve sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and is not recommended for HSDD [^114yn5ey] [^114LPJZF] [^112wqAxc] [^117GX1vK].

> Wait, I should double-check that I am not conflating DHEA with DHEA-S supplementation for this indication. Let me reconsider: trials administer DHEA, which increases circulating DHEA-S and sex steroids, but there is no established practice of direct DHEA-S dosing for postmenopausal sexual dysfunction, and the clinical question about "DHEA-S levels" usually reflects the reservoir biomarker response to oral DHEA rather than a therapeutic target for dosing [^114k8LiV] [^116FNw2S].

> Next, I should review local therapy because desire disorders differ from dyspareunia due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause. I will now examine intravaginal prasterone; the FDA-approved dose is 6.5 mg intravaginal daily for GSM-related vulvovaginal dryness and dyspareunia, with high-quality guideline support, and pharmacokinetic work shows minimal to no meaningful rise in circulating sex steroids during 12 weeks of use and no endometrial stimulation over longer durations, but hold on, I should verify that this local therapy is not indicated for low desire, and indeed guidelines restrict its role to GSM rather than HSDD [^114Ka8N7] [^116FcPLe] [^116x3xxn] [^112wqAxc].

> But wait, what if the woman has adrenal insufficiency or another androgen-deficient state. I should confirm that this is an exception; in androgen-deficient populations such as hypopituitarism or primary adrenal insufficiency, physiologic DHEA replacement can improve some domains of wellbeing and sometimes sexuality, which is different from postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and does not justify routine DHEA for HSDD in otherwise healthy postmenopausal patients [^11382k61] [^114k8LiV].

> Let me synthesize the evidence-based answer now. For postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function, there is no established target DHEA-S level or oral DHEA dose that produces clinically meaningful improvements in sexual desire or overall sexual function; although oral DHEA at doses ≥ 50 mg/day reliably produces biochemically meaningful increases in testosterone and estradiol, randomized trials and meta-analyses do not show corresponding clinical benefit for HSDD, and major guidelines recommend against its use for this indication [^116bnzzy] [^114yn5ey] [^112wqAxc]. In contrast, for dyspareunia due to vulvovaginal atrophy, local intravaginal DHEA at 6.5 mg daily is an evidence-based option with minimal systemic exposure and is not intended to treat low desire [^114Ka8N7].

> I should confirm the recommended androgen strategy when HSDD is diagnosed after appropriate biopsychosocial assessment and other causes are addressed. The evidence-based therapy is physiologic-dose transdermal testosterone, typically around 300 micrograms per day, which improves desire and related outcomes in postmenopausal women, with monitoring to keep total testosterone within the premenopausal female range and to avoid supraphysiologic dosing, acknowledging that this use is off-label in many regions and requires shared decision-making and side effect surveillance [^114CZ4De] [^114GtERN] [^112NbCQU] [^113stVjP].

> I need to ensure safety points are not overlooked. If a patient is nevertheless using oral DHEA, I should counsel that trials report androgenic adverse effects without proven benefit for HSDD and that systemic DHEA can modestly increase estradiol and testosterone, which may be undesirable in some contexts; in contrast, transdermal testosterone should be titrated carefully with periodic labs and clinical checks to minimize acne, hirsutism, or other androgen excess signs while staying within physiologic female ranges [^114yn5ey] [^116bnzzy] [^113stVjP].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical takeaway one more time. There is no evidence-based DHEA-S target or oral DHEA dose that yields clinically meaningful improvement in sexual desire for postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function, local vaginal prasterone is for GSM-related dyspareunia with negligible systemic hormone changes, and when HSDD is confirmed, physiologic transdermal testosterone, not DHEA, is the recommended androgen therapy alongside comprehensive biopsychosocial care and monitoring [^112wqAxc] [^114Ka8N7] [^114CZ4De].

Oral DHEA **25–50 mg/day** [^116FNw2S] is the usual dose range to raise DHEAS into the low-normal premenopausal range in postmenopausal women [^112tfgT8]; however, **no consistent sexual benefit** has been demonstrated in those with normal adrenal function [^114LPJZF] [^114yn5ey] [^112wqAxc]. For vulvovaginal atrophy with dyspareunia, **intravaginal prasterone 6.5 mg nightly** is effective [^114Ka8N7] and does not meaningfully increase systemic DHEAS [^116FcPLe]. Androgenic side effects (acne, hirsutism) are dose-related [^114yn5ey]; monitor DHEAS and testosterone if using systemic DHEA [^112wqAxc], and consider transdermal testosterone for HSDD if indicated [^112NbCQU] [^114CZ4De].

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DHEA supplementation

DHEA is a prohormone converted to androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues [^114k8LiV]; **oral DHEA increases DHEAS** and downstream androgens [^116FNw2S], with variable changes in estradiol [^116bnzzy]. Intravaginal DHEA delivers local estrogenic/androgenic effects with minimal systemic exposure [^116FcPLe].

---

## Clinical evidence on DHEA supplementation and sexual function

### Systemic DHEA supplementation

- **RCT evidence**: Oral DHEA 50 mg/day for 12–52 weeks increases DHEAS as well as androgens [^112tfgT8] but does not improve sexual function versus placebo in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function [^114yn5ey] [^112wqAxc].

- **Meta-analysis**: No significant benefit on libido or sexual function in women with normal adrenal function [^114LPJZF] [^112wqAxc].

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne and hirsutism are more common at higher doses (e.g. 50 mg/day) [^114yn5ey] [^11382k61].

---

### Intravaginal DHEA supplementation

Prasterone **6.5 mg nightly** improves dyspareunia and sexual function in GSM [^114Ka8N7] with minimal systemic steroid changes [^116FcPLe]. There is no proliferative effect on the **endometrium** with long-term use [^116x3xxn].

---

## Recommended DHEA dosage for meaningful DHEAS elevation

Oral DHEA **25–50 mg/day** raises DHEAS into the low-normal premenopausal range [^116FNw2S] [^112tfgT8]; 25 mg/day produces moderate increases, whereas 50 mg/day produces larger increases with more androgenic side effects [^111sGvFu] [^114yn5ey]. Intravaginal prasterone **6.5 mg** produces minimal changes in systemic DHEAS and is not intended to raise systemic DHEAS [^116FcPLe] [^114Ka8N7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Systemic DHEA**: Not recommended for HSDD in women with normal adrenal function due to inconsistent efficacy as well as androgenic side effects [^112wqAxc] [^117GX1vK] [^114k8LiV].

- **Intravaginal DHEA**: Recommended for GSM-related dyspareunia; effective and safe with minimal systemic exposure [^114Ka8N7] [^116FcPLe].

- **Testosterone therapy**: Consider transdermal testosterone for HSDD when other causes are excluded; monitor to keep levels within the female physiologic range [^112NbCQU] [^114CZ4De] [^114GtERN].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Androgenic side effects**: Acne, hirsutism, and alopecia are dose-related; monitor DHEAS and testosterone during systemic DHEA use [^114yn5ey] [^112wqAxc].

- **Cardiometabolic risks**: Long-term safety is uncertain; avoid supraphysiologic dosing [^114k8LiV] [^112wqAxc].

- **Endometrial safety**: Intravaginal DHEA does not stimulate the endometrium [^116x3xxn].

## Summary of evidence

| **DHEA formulation** | **Recommended dosage** | **Effect on DHEAS levels** | **Clinical efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Oral DHEA | 25–50 mg/day | Significant increase | No consistent benefit for sexual function | Androgenic side effects |
| Intravaginal prasterone | 6.5 mg nightly | Minimal systemic change | Effective for dyspareunia | Minimal systemic exposure |

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^112NbCQU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Testosterone is specifically indicated for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women when no other underlying causes for this condition are identified. For example, systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD, particularly when the condition develops after menopause. Transdermal testosterone has no significant impact on lipid profiles. However, oral administration increases LDL-cholesterol, reduces total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and triglycerides, and may cause side effects such as acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair), and voice deepening. It can also aggravate health risks, including cardiovascular alterations, lipid imbalances, and insulin resistance, especially in vulnerable individuals.

Notably, due to the peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens, its absolute contraindications align with those of estradiol, encompassing hormone-dependent cancers (e.g. breast cancer, meningioma, and endometrial cancer), as well as thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Total testosterone levels should be measured before starting treatment because the appropriate dosage should achieve and maintain total testosterone levels within the premenopausal physiological range. Currently, there is no standardized dose or average administration time. To this end, a daily dose of around 300 micrograms of testosterone is typically prescribed.

### Serum steroid levels during 12-week intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone administration [^116FcPLe]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the serum steroid levels during a 12-week daily intravaginal administration of various concentrations of DHEA (Prasterone) 1.3 mL ovules. A previous 1-week study demonstrated no or minimal changes in the serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its metabolites after up to daily 1.8% (23.4 mg) intravaginal DHEA.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study, 218 postmenopausal women (age range, 42–74 years) were randomized to receive daily one of four DHEA concentrations intravaginally. Serum steroids were measured by Good Laboratory Practice-validated mass spectrometry technology in samples obtained at the time of the visit.

- **Results**: The serum levels of DHEA and 11 of its metabolites were measured at screening, day 1, and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Results showed no or minimal changes during the entire observation period, with all values remaining well within the limits of normal postmenopausal women. No accumulation of steroid metabolites nor change in DHEA bioavailability was detected.

- **Conclusions**: The present data indicate that local, daily intravaginal DHEA administration at doses of 3.25–13 mg can rapidly and efficiently correct all signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy and improve sexual function. Importantly, it caused no or minimal changes in serum sex steroid levels, which remained within the normal postmenopausal range, thus avoiding the risks associated with estrogen formulations.

Is DHEA effective for the treatment of HSDD?

Given that DHEA is an important precursor for extragonadal synthesis of estrogen and testosterone in postmenopausal women, that the production declines with increasing age, and that studies have demonstrated the association of low levels of DHEA with low desire, oral systemic DHEA has been investigated as a possible treatment for HSDD in postmenopausal women. However, evidence is sparse and inconsistent, resulting from heterogeneous study designs, many of which were limited by small sample sizes and the use of non-validated instruments to measure sexual function. Larger studies using validated instruments for the measurement of sexual function have not shown improvement in sexual function in postmenopausal women treated with DHEA. A meta-analysis in 2014 found that DHEA therapy did not improve sexual desire or other aspects of sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function. Therefore, oral DHEA cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

In contrast, local vaginal DHEA has only been effective for the treatment of dyspareunia because of vulvovaginal atrophy. An intravaginal DHEA formulation, Prasterone (Intrarosa, Endoceutics), has been approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of dyspareunia due to menopause.

### A randomized trial of oral DHEA treatment for sexual function, well-being, and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with low libido [^114yn5ey]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, which are the most abundant steroids in women, decline with age. We have shown an association between low sexual function and low circulating DHEAS levels in women.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the restoration of circulating DHEA levels in postmenopausal women to the levels seen in young individuals improves sexual function.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three postmenopausal women not using estrogen therapy were enrolled in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received either DHEA 50 mg or placebo (PL) daily.

- **Main outcome measures**: Efficacy was assessed through 26 weeks. The main outcome measures were the change in total satisfying sexual events (SSE) and the change in the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale (SSS) total score. Secondary measures were the Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire (PGWB) and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL). Hormonal levels, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinical labs were evaluated over 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Eighty-five participants (91%) were included in the 26-week efficacy analysis. There were no significant differences between the DHEA and PL groups in the change in total SSE per month or the SSS, PGWB, and MENQOL change scores. Overall AE reports and the number of withdrawals as a result of AEs were similar in both groups; however, more women in the DHEA group experienced androgenic effects such as acne and increased hair growth.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, treatment of postmenopausal women with oral DHEA did not significantly improve sexual function, well-being, or menopausal symptoms compared to placebo.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^114rchcE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. Our analysis of 21 RCTs revealed that DHEA supplementation significantly increased both testosterone and estradiol concentrations, although substantial heterogeneity was observed across the included trials.

Our findings indicate that DHEA is particularly effective in elevating testosterone levels when administered at dosages ≥ 50 mg/day. Additionally, a marked increase in estradiol levels was noted among participants aged ≥ 60 years receiving the same dosage. These findings are consistent with a previous meta-analysis by Li et al, which reported increased testosterone levels in participants receiving > 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≤ 12 weeks, particularly among those under 60 years of age. Similarly, Zhu et al. found that estradiol concentrations were significantly increased in participants aged ≥ 60 years who received ≥ 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≥ 26 weeks. The variation in effective intervention duration may stem from differences in study populations. Our meta-analysis focused exclusively on postmenopausal women, which may have contributed to differing results compared to previous analyses involving broader populations.

Most of the included trials in our study had an intervention duration of 6 to 12 months; therefore, we used 26 weeks (approximately 6 months) as the stratification threshold. While the average increase in estradiol was 7.86 pg/mL, this change may be clinically minimal.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in healthy men with an age-related decline of dehydroepiandrosterone secretion [^11154z8y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Serum dehydroepiandrosterone declines with age. Whether this represents a harmful deficiency or an age-related adaptation is not known. Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in adrenal insufficiency, a state of pathological loss of dehydroepiandrosterone production, improves well-being, mood, and sexuality. To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in healthy men with a physiological, age-related decline in serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, we conducted a double-blind cross-over study in 22 healthy male volunteers (age range, 50–69 years) with endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels below 4.1 micromol/liter (1500 ng/ml). They received 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone (50 mg/day) and 4 months of placebo treatment in random order, with a 1-month washout period. Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment increased serum dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to concentrations usually found in young men.

- **Androgen levels**: Circulating androgen levels did not change; however, androgen metabolites increased, indicating enhanced peripheral androgen synthesis.
- **Baseline assessments**: At baseline, psychometric assessments revealed normal well-being and sexuality scores.
- **Mood and sexuality effects**: After 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone, no effect on sexuality was observed, whereas some mood scores improved slightly but were not significantly different from scores after placebo.
- **Comparison with placebo**: Compared with placebo, dehydroepiandrosterone had no effect on serum lipids, bone markers, body composition, or exercise capacity.

Thus, in contrast to previous findings in adrenal insufficiency, we found no obvious benefit of 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in the studied population.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113BPZ8e]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Before prescribing testosterone therapy, clinicians should obtain informed consent. They should explain that for women, it is an off-label therapy. Clinicians must counsel patients regarding the benefits and risks through shared decision-making, recognizing the patient's goals and concerns, and provide detailed documentation of the discussion.

Dosing should be targeted to achieve testosterone concentrations within the physiologic premenopausal range. In a study of premenopausal women with no complaints of sexual dysfunction intended to define normal female androgen values, women aged 20–29 years, 30–39 years, and 40–49 years had testosterone values ranging from 45.5 to 57.5 ng/dl, 27.6 to 39.8 ng/dl, and 27.0 to 38.6 ng/dl, respectively. This range is approximately 1/10th–1/15th of the systemic testosterone values in healthy men (range 300–800 ng/dl). Thus, treatment using any male product for women should be initiated using one-tenth of the recommended starting dose for men.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^117L1rrH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The initial search yielded 7,256 records. After removing 1,872 duplicates, 5,384 records were screened based on titles and abstracts, leading to the exclusion of studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The full texts of 61 potentially relevant articles were then reviewed in detail. Of these, 21 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. These studies comprised 17 trial arms reporting on estradiol outcomes and 20 trial arms reporting on testosterone outcomes.

A total of 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review, with studies conducted across diverse geographic locations including the United States, Italy, Australia, Israel, Japan, Germany, Mexico, and Sweden. The studies were published between 1995 and 2019. Sample sizes varied from 14 to 280 participants, and participants were generally postmenopausal women with diverse profiles: healthy individuals, those with primary Sjogren's syndrome, mild to moderate cognitive impairment, or classified as frail. The administered dose of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ranged from 10 to 100 mg/day, with intervention durations spanning from 2 weeks to 12 months. Most trials employed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.

### Clinically relevant changes in sexual desire, satisfying sexual activity and personal distress as measured by the profile of female sexual function, sexual activity log, and personal distress scale in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^116qG1gY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Transdermal testosterone patch (TTP) treatment produced statistically significant improvements in a satisfying sexual activity (SSA), sexual desire, and personal distress in postmenopausal women suffering from hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), but the clinical significance of these changes was not determined.

- **Aim**: To quantify the magnitude of change in three principal outcome measures determined by HSDD patients as associated with the perception of meaningful benefit with TTP therapy.

- **Methods**: The criteria for defining responders were determined using anchoring methodology and receiver operating characteristics analysis to establish minimum important differences (MIDs) in a representative subsample of 132 patients in two randomized controlled trials in surgically menopausal women with HSDD (N = 1,094). Perceived benefit was established based upon the question "Overall, would you say that you experienced a meaningful benefit from the study patches?" These data defined responders and established MIDs for changes in sexual desire, SSA, and personal distress. The MIDs were applied to the two trials to establish responder rates in each treatment group.

- **Main outcome measures**: Changes in score that correspond to the MID for sexual desire, SSA, and personal distress, and responder rates in each treatment group based upon these values.

- **Results**: Increases in the frequency of SSA of greater than 1 activity/4 weeks, increases in sexual desire score of ≥ 8.9, and decreases in the personal distress score of ≥ 20.0 were identified as threshold improvements.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^116iHkKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

As described above, the loss of female hormones is associated with fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight gain, hot flashes, and night sweats. In some cases, androgen therapy has been used to reduce these symptoms. Androgens are 19 carbon (C19) steroids, hormones primarily synthesized by the adrenal glands, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfated form (DHEAS), as well as androstenedione (A4), which is a weak androgenic steroid hormone of 19 carbons. These adrenal androgens have minimal intrinsic activity but act as precursors to testosterone and estrogens.

In women, the adrenal glands contribute 30% to 50% of circulating testosterone, while the ovaries synthesize both DHEA and testosterone. Only testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activate the androgen receptor, whereas other androgens function as precursors. DHEA is produced by both the adrenal glands and ovaries, with additional input from DHEAS conversion. A4 and testosterone also originate from both glands, with circulating testosterone existing in free form or bound to albumin and Sex Hormone‐Binding Globulin (SHBG). DHEA, administered locally, can be converted to testosterone and estrogen. Its use may increase these hormone levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, potentially alleviating symptoms and improving well‐being. While its effect on menopausal symptoms remains uncertain, DHEA may slightly enhance sexual function compared to placebo due to its androgenic effects.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^111jPPZk]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The impact of DHEA administration on estradiol in postmenopausal women was assessed in seventeen trial arms, involving a total of 986 participants (482 in the intervention group and 504 in the control group). The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant increase in estradiol levels following DHEA administration (WMD: 7.86 pg/mL; 95% CI 6.33–9.40; P ≤ 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity among studies (I² = 92%, P ≤ 0.001).

- **Forest plot of the randomized controlled trials**: The trials investigated the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on serum estradiol concentrations. When stratified by intervention duration, a slightly greater effect was observed in participants receiving DHEA for less than 26 weeks (WMD: 7.93 pg/mL; 95% CI 2.94–12.92; P = 0.002) compared to those treated for 26 weeks or more (WMD: 7.50 pg/mL; 95% CI 6.50–8.51; P ≤ 0.001). However, the overlapping confidence intervals suggest no statistically significant difference between the subgroups.

- **Subgroup analysis by dosage**: DHEA doses of 50 mg/day or more significantly increased estradiol levels (WMD: 8.65 pg/mL; 95% CI 7.07–10.22; P ≤ 0.001), whereas doses less than 50 mg/day did not result in a significant change (WMD: 0.64 pg/mL; 95% CI −4.69 to 5.98; P = 0.813).

- **Participants' age analysis**: Studies involving participants aged 60 years or older demonstrated a more pronounced increase in estradiol levels (WMD: 8.92 pg/mL; 95% CI 7.33–10.51; P ≤ 0.001) compared to those with participants younger than 60 years (WMD: 3.04 pg/mL; 95% CI −4.79 to 10.88; P ≤ 0.001).

### Lack of influence of dyspareunia on the beneficial effect of intravaginal prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women [^115bATWR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Intravaginal prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) has been previously observed to improve all domains of female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of moderate to severe pain during sexual activity (dyspareunia) at baseline on FSD following prasterone administration.

- **Methods**: The effect of daily administration of prasterone (0, 3.25 mg, 6.5 mg, or 13 mg) for 12 weeks on FSD was evaluated in 215 postmenopausal women who had, or did not have, moderate to severe dyspareunia at baseline. This was done through a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study examined differences in desire, arousal, and orgasm.

- **Results**: Comparable benefits were observed in women without moderate to severe dyspareunia (n = 56) vs. those with dyspareunia (n = 159). The benefits over placebo in prasterone-treated women for desire, avoiding intimacy, and vaginal dryness, as well as for the total sexual domain of the MENQOL (Menopause Specific Quality of Life) questionnaire, ranged between 18.0% and 38.2% with P values of < 0.05 or < 0.01, except in one out of 12 subgroups. For the arousal/sensation, arousal/lubrication, and summary score of the ASF (Abbreviated Sexual Function) questionnaire, in the dyspareunia-positive group, improvements of 64.2% (P = 0.01), 118% (P = 0.001), and 31.1% (P = 0.03) were observed over placebo, respectively. Similar differences (58.0%, 67.6%, and 32.1%) did not reach statistical significance in the dyspareunia-negative group, which had up to only 44 prasterone-treated women compared with 119 in the dyspareunia-positive group.

- **Conclusions**: The absence of moderate to severe dyspareunia at baseline does not apparently affect the effects of intravaginal prasterone.

### Should dehydroepiandrosterone be administered to women [^114k8LiV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Androgen prohormones, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), increase in early puberty, peak in the second and third decades, and thereafter decline, independent of menopausal status. Investigators have examined their potential beneficial effects in normal women and those with DHEA-deficient states.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A review of the literature from 1985 to 2021 on the potential benefits and risks of androgen prohormones in women.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Studies have examined the potential benefit of DHEA therapy for anti-aging, sexual dysfunction, infertility, metabolic bone health, cognition, and wellbeing in hormone-deficient states such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and anorexia, as well as administration to normal women across the lifespan.

- **Conclusions**: Data support small benefits in quality of life and mood but not for anxiety or sexual function in women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or anorexia. No consistent beneficial effects of DHEA administration have been observed for menopausal symptoms, sexual function, cognition, or overall wellbeing in normal women. Local administration of DHEA shows benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy. Use of DHEA to improve induction of ovulation response in women with diminished ovarian reserve is not recommended. Risks of high physiologic or pharmacologic use of DHEA include androgenic and estrogenic side effects, which are of concern for long-term administration.

- **Clinical case**: A 49-year-old woman with Addison's disease who is on low dose estrogen with cyclic progesterone therapy for menopausal symptoms.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114GtERN]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). High credibility.

There is consistent evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that testosterone therapy is more effective than placebo for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women. The earlier studies evaluated testosterone implants and oral testosterone formulations; however, these modes of testosterone administration often result in supraphysiological concentrations. In contrast, treatment of women with transdermal testosterone, either as a patch releasing 300 mcg of testosterone per day or a manufactured cream delivering 5 mg of testosterone in 0.5 mL (10 mg/mL) daily, results in free testosterone levels within the normal premenopausal range.

Transdermal testosterone improves sexual desire and reduces sexually associated personal distress in naturally and surgically menopausal women, both with and without concurrent estrogen ± progestogen therapy, presenting with HSDD. In studies of women with HSDD, transdermal testosterone also improved the frequency of satisfying sexual events, arousal, orgasm frequency, pleasure, responsiveness, and self-image while reducing sexual concerns. In two studies, surgically menopausal women with HSDD treated with transdermal testosterone experienced a statistically significantly greater meaningful treatment benefit than those who received placebo, as reported during face-to-face interviews. Women who identified as having a clinically meaningful benefit also achieved larger statistically significant improvements in sexual desire, satisfying sexual activity, and personal distress than those who did not.

### Female sexual dysfunction: Common questions and answers [^114Hw5c7]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of female sexual dysfunction, particularly in the context of managing sexual arousal disorder, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend acknowledging that transdermal testosterone patches at a dose of 300 mcg have been studied more extensively than other forms. However, they are not commercially available. It is important to monitor patients for signs of androgen excess.

### Clinical review: The benefits and harms of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LPJZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy has been proposed to replenish the depletion of endogenous DHEA and its sulfate form, which occurs with advancing age and is thought to be associated with loss of libido and menopausal symptoms.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence supporting the use of systemic DHEA in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2014. Pairs of reviewers, working independently, selected studies and extracted data from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the random-effects model to pool across studies and evaluated heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic.

We included 23 RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias, enrolling 1,188 women. DHEA use was not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function (standardized mean difference, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.73; P value = .06; I(2) = 62%). There was also no significant effect of DHEA on serious adverse effects, serum lipids, serum glucose, weight, body mass index, or bone mineral density. This evidence warranted low confidence in the results, mostly due to imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency across RCTs.

Evidence warranting low confidence suggests that DHEA administration does not significantly impact sexual symptoms or selected metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurement, and the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine, such that circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells. The complex regulation of AR (androgen receptor) expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase, and individual differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desire, or if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for the androgen effect on sexual desire.

- **Rationale for testosterone therapy in women**: Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration while undergoing treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when premenopausal physiologic levels are mimicked.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^116bnzzy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol concentrations in postmenopausal women have produced conflicting results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to evaluate the impact of DHEA supplementation on serum testosterone and estradiol levels and provide evidence regarding the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify relevant studies published before June 11, 2024. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model and presented as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: The analysis included 21 studies, comprising 17 trial arms assessing estradiol and 20 assessing testosterone. DHEA supplementation significantly increased estradiol (WMD: 7.86 pg/mL; 95% CI 6.33–9.40; P ≤ 0.001) and testosterone levels (WMD: 24.31 ng/dL; 95% CI 15.22–33.40; P ≤ 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed greater increases in estradiol levels among studies using DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 8.65 pg/mL) and those with participants aged ≥ 60 years (WMD: 8.92 pg/mL), although the differences were modest and 95% CIs overlapped. For testosterone, higher levels were observed with DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 29.65 ng/dL).

- **Conclusion**: DHEA supplementation at doses ≥ 50 mg/day significantly increases testosterone levels in postmenopausal women. Moreover, in women aged ≥ 60 years, supplementation at the same dosage significantly elevates estradiol levels.

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone for women: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial data [^114CZ4De]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment for women with diminished sexual well-being remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the potential benefits and risks of testosterone for women.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for blinded, randomised controlled trials of testosterone treatment of at least 12 weeks' duration completed between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 10, 2018. We also searched drug registration applications to the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration to identify any unpublished data. The primary outcomes were the effects of testosterone on sexual function, cardiometabolic variables, cognitive measures, and musculoskeletal health.

- **Findings**: Our search strategy retrieved 46 reports of 36 randomised controlled trials comprising 8480 participants. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared with a placebo or a comparator (e.g. oestrogen, with or without progestogen), testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory sexual event frequency (mean difference 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18), sexual desire (standardised mean difference 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.50), pleasure (mean difference 6.86, 95% CI 5.19 to 8.52), arousal (standardised mean difference 0.28, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.35), orgasm (standardised mean difference 0.25, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.32), and responsiveness.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116jsF1s]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

In women whose total testosterone levels are in the upper end of the physiologic range and not experiencing improvement of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) symptoms, calculating free testosterone might provide insight into the lack of response to therapy. An online free and bioavailable testosterone calculator, utilizing total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) values, is available. If elevated SHBG (and resultant decreased free testosterone) is deemed to be related to the lack of efficacy of testosterone therapy, the contributing factors should be addressed; if modification is not possible, the clinician should use a different approach to managing the woman's HSDD. Increasing the woman's testosterone dose and total testosterone levels beyond the physiologic range to "overcome" elevated SHBG is a clinical strategy that is not supported by evidence on androgen metabolism, androgen receptor (AR) effects, and intracrine effects, as well as short- and long-term safety concerns. In countries where tibolone is available, it can be used as an alternative menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women with high SHBG, as tibolone lowers SHBG by approximately 45%.

Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess, including acne (oily skin), hirsutism (increased facial hair), as well as androgenic alopecia (thinning of scalp hair). If side effects occur, the dose of testosterone should usually be decreased. Occasionally, androgenic side effects may occur despite standard dosing or normal serum levels of total testosterone or both. This circumstance may occur with low concentrations of SHBG, which may be associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and/or obesity.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^114JGuQH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been shown in medically and psychiatrically healthy women able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women more clearly sexually dysfunctional, in keeping with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder, have not been studied. Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire, with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. How to identify women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains unknown: neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds. The long-term safety of systemic testosterone with or without estrogen is unknown but necessary as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

### The current outlook for testosterone in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^111MrMrT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a common clinical problem in women, especially those who have experienced surgical menopause. Because androgen levels decline with age and drop dramatically following bilateral oophorectomy, it has been hypothesized that reduced levels of testosterone are related to diminished desire.

- **Aim**: As presented at a continuing medical education satellite symposium during the 2008 annual meeting of the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, the aim was to review the state of knowledge about the physiologic effects of testosterone in postmenopausal women, the effects of transdermal testosterone delivery in surgically menopausal women with HSDD, and ongoing studies of a transdermal testosterone gel.

- **Methods**: A review of the pertinent literature, including recent presentations.

- **Main outcome measures**: Results from the Women's International Study of Health and Sexuality; and studies utilizing the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women, the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and validated instruments that assess female sexual function: the Sexual Activity Log, the Profile of Female Sexual Function, and the Personal Distress Scale.

- **Results**: Surgically menopausal women receiving testosterone experience significant increases in total satisfying sexual activity vs. women receiving placebo, significant improvement in all domains of sexual function, and decreases in personal distress, with a favorable safety profile.

- **Conclusions**: Testosterone deficiency may be considered among the underlying causes of HSD.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^111V2Mfm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol concentrations in postmenopausal women have produced conflicting results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to evaluate the impact of DHEA supplementation on serum testosterone and estradiol levels and to provide evidence regarding the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation.

Subgroup analyses showed greater increases in estradiol levels among studies using DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 8.65 pg/mL) and those with participants aged ≥ 60 years (WMD: 8.92 pg/mL), although the differences were modest and 95% CIs overlapped. For testosterone, higher levels were observed with DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 29.65 ng/dL).

- **Conclusion**: DHEA supplementation at doses ≥ 50 mg/day significantly increases testosterone levels in postmenopausal women. Moreover, in women aged ≥ 60 years, supplementation at the same dosage significantly elevates estradiol.

### Androgen replacement therapy in women [^116tE8Lo]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is a review of the literature concerning androgen replacement therapy in women.

- **Design**: The design involves a review of the MEDLINE database and references from articles.

- **Conclusions**: Androgens have significant effects on sexual function, bone health, muscle mass, body composition, mood, energy, and overall well-being. Androgen insufficiency is evident in patients with conditions such as hypopituitarism, adrenalectomy, oophorectomy, and in some women undergoing oral estrogen therapy. Such therapy increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and decreases the free and bioavailable forms of testosterone (T). Symptoms of androgen insufficiency in women may include a diminished sense of well-being, low mood, fatigue, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, decreased libido, or decreased sexual receptivity and pleasure, which cause significant personal distress. Evidence from clinical trials largely supports the correlation between decreased endogenous androgen levels and these symptoms, alongside the alleviation of many symptoms through administration of testosterone or, in some cases, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). However, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved androgen preparations for treating androgen insufficiency in women. The safety profile of androgens, at doses used for hypoactive sexual desire disorder treatment, is excellent, with only mild acne and hirsutism noted in a minority of patients.

### Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women [^117SGgXp]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Circulating testosterone in women declines during the late reproductive years, such that otherwise healthy women in their 40s have approximately half the testosterone level of women in their 20s. Despite this, research showing the benefits of androgen replacement has been limited to the postmenopausal years. In view of the known premenopausal physiological decline in testosterone, we have evaluated the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy on mood, well-being, and sexual function in eugonadal, premenopausal women presenting with low libido.

Premenopausal women with low libido participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover efficacy study of testosterone cream (10 mg/day). This study included two double-blind, 12-week treatment periods separated by a single-blind, 4-week washout period. Thirty-four women completed the study per protocol, with 31 women (mean age 39.7 ± 4.2 years; serum testosterone 1.07 ± 0.50 nmol/L) providing complete data.

- **Results**: Testosterone therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in the composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index [+12.9 (95% CI, +4.6 to +21.2), P = 0.003] and the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale [+15.7 (95% CI, +6.5 to +25.0), P = 0.001] compared with placebo. A mean decrease in the Beck Depression Inventory score approached significance [-2.8 (95% CI, -5.7 to +0.1), P = 0.06]. Mean total testosterone levels during treatment were at the high end of the normal range, and estradiol was unchanged. No adverse effects were reported.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation and bone turnover in middle-aged to elderly men [^116r6HoN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

In this placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we assessed the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation (90 mg orally per day) on bone turnover in 43 healthy men aged 56–80 years. Participants received either a placebo or the steroid for 6 months, followed by a 1-month washout period, and then a further 6 months of the opposite agent. Serum samples were collected at baseline, and at 3, 6, 7, and 13 months. These were assayed for procollagen peptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin, all markers of bone formation. Measurements were also made of serum cortisol, DHEA/DHEA-S, estradiol (E2), and free and total testosterone (T). Additionally, first void, fasting urine samples were collected at baseline, 6, 7, and 13 months and assessed for deoxypyridinoline, a marker of bone resorption.

Mean serum DHEA and DHEA-S levels in treated men increased approximately 3-fold (from approximately 2.2 ng/ml to approximately 6 ng/ml) and 4.5-fold (from approximately 1000 ng/ml to approximately 4500 ng/ml), respectively, after 6 months, and returned to baseline after washout. Similarly, circulating E2 concentrations were also increased 1.4-fold (from approximately 16 to 23 pg/ml; P < 0.001), a finding not observed with any other measured hormone. Bone marker levels remained remarkably constant at each sampling interval: procollagen peptide at approximately 8.0 ng/ml, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase at approximately 21.0 U/liter, and deoxypyridinoline at approximately 4.5 nmol/mmol Cr. Osteocalcin showed a transient reduction from approximately 10.2 to 6.2 ng/ml, P < 0.005 to P < 0.001, at 3 months, but this decline was observed in both treated and control groups.

### Clinical review: DHEA replacement for postmenopausal women [^111S1Cxo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are important precursors for estrogen as well as androgen production, treatment with DHEA is a physiologically based strategy for the alleviation of hormone deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women. We have summarized the physiology of DHEA in women and reviewed the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the effects of DHEA therapy in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We reviewed the medical literature for key papers investigating DHEA physiology and RCT of the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women through November 2010. The focus was on sexual function, well-being, metabolic parameters, and cognition as study endpoints.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although cross-sectional studies have indicated a link between low DHEA levels and impaired sexual function, well-being, and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, placebo-controlled RCT do not show benefits of oral DHEA for any of these outcomes or favorable effects on lipids and carbohydrate metabolism.

- **Conclusions**: Taken together, findings from this review of the published literature of studies do not support the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women at this time.

### Educational programs and sexual counselling for postmenopausal sexual dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111weRgc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction has a high prevalence among women in the postmenopausal period. Factors such as comorbidities and chronic illnesses contribute to this prevalence. Psychological and interpersonal factors also play a significant role. Sexual counselling educational programs have shown positive sexual behavioral changes and should be considered the first-line approach to female sexual dysfunction in this group of women.

- **Aim**: To review the evidence of the efficacy of sexual counselling educational programs for sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in February 2021 using electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Scopus), unpublished studies, ongoing clinical trials, conference abstracts and journal archives, dissertations and theses, gray literature, and a free search on the Google Scholar search engine. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of sexual educational programs in postmenopausal women were selected. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Extracted data included author identification, publication date, geographic location, study population and sample size, type of intervention, sexual function evaluation tool, and outcome. Studies evaluating sexual function using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were included in the meta-analysis, calculating the mean difference.

- **Outcomes**: Improvement of sexual function in postmenopausal women.

- **Results**: We included eight studies in the systematic review, six randomized and two nonrandomized.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^111sGvFu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The impact of DHEA administration on testosterone in postmenopausal women is evident. Twenty trial arms, including 1,084 participants (519 in the DHEA group and 565 in the control group), evaluated testosterone levels following DHEA supplementation. The meta-analysis revealed a significant increase in testosterone levels in the DHEA group, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 24.31 ng/dL (95% CI 15.22–33.40; P ≤ 0.001), accompanied by considerable heterogeneity (I² = 99%; P ≤ 0.001).

- **Subgroup analysis by duration**: Supplementation for ≥ 26 weeks led to a greater increase in testosterone levels (WMD: 24.77 ng/dL; 95% CI 16.59–32.96; P ≤ 0.001) compared to < 26 weeks (WMD: 19.04 ng/dL; 95% CI − 8.41 to 46.49; P = 0.174). However, the overlapping confidence intervals again suggest no statistically significant difference between durations.

- **Dosage analysis**: DHEA at doses ≥ 50 mg/day was associated with a significant increase in testosterone levels (WMD: 29.65 ng/dL; 95% CI 21.33–37.98; P ≤ 0.001), whereas doses < 50 mg/day did not yield a significant effect (WMD: 8.36 ng/dL; 95% CI − 1.91 to 18.64; P = 0.111).

- **Age-stratified analysis**: Significant increases in testosterone were observed in both age groups, with participants < 60 years showing a WMD of 25.57 ng/dL (95% CI 7.33–43.77; P = 0.006) and participants ≥ 60 years showing a WMD of 24.87 ng/dL (95% CI 14.56–35.18; P ≤ 0.001). The similarity in effect sizes suggests minimal age-related difference.

### Testosterone prohormone supplements [^1134ZwCh]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Testosterone prohormones, such as androstenedione, androstenediol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), have been heavily marketed as testosterone-enhancing and muscle-building nutritional supplements for the past decade. Concerns over the safety of prohormone supplement use prompted the United States Food and Drug Administration to call for a ban on androstenedione sales, and Congress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which classifies androstenedione and 17 other steroids as controlled substances. As of January 2005, these substances cannot be sold without a prescription.

Here, we summarize the scientific knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of prohormone supplementation in humans. We focus primarily on androstenedione, but we also discuss DHEA, androstenediol, 19-nor androstenedione, and 19-nor androstenediol supplements. Contrary to marketing claims, research at the time of writing indicates that the use of prohormone nutritional supplements (DHEA, androstenedione, androstenediol, and other steroid hormone supplements) does not produce either anabolic or ergogenic effects in men. Moreover, the use of prohormone nutritional supplements may raise the risk for negative health consequences.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis update [^113GhtXJ]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

- **Question**: What is the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women?

- **Findings**: Forty-seven randomized controlled trials (35,912 participants) evaluating the effect of HT were included. Estrogen therapy, estrogen plus progestogen therapy, tibolone, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, compared with control, may result in no effect to small benefit on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Heterogeneity of effects across studies was low to high.

- **Meaning**: HT may slightly improve sexual function. The effect of HT on sexual function should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms.

With 71% to 76% of middle-aged women stating that sexual activity is an important aspect of their lives, sexual well-being during menopause is a necessary concern. Sexual function is often described in opposition to female sexual dysfunction (FSD), which is a clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually, or to experience sexual pleasure, that causes distress. Distressing sexual problems peak among middle-aged women, whereas sexual problems without accompanying distress tend to increase with age. The International Menopause Society recommends a biopsychosocial approach to sexual function, accounting for fluctuations in health status, neurochemical balance, psychological issues, interpersonal concerns, and sociocultural beliefs and values.

Hormone therapy (HT) is the first-line treatment for moderate to severe genitourinary symptoms of menopause.

### Lack of effect of intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, prasterone) on the endometrium in postmenopausal women [^116x3xxn]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, prasterone) on the endometrium in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: Intravaginal DHEA (6.5 mg) was administered daily for 52 weeks to 422 women, who had endometrial biopsy at baseline and end of study, whereas 15 women were similarly treated for 26 to 52 weeks. Participants in three other studies received 3.25 mg (n = 126), 6.5 mg (n = 129), or 13 mg (n = 30) of DHEA for 12 weeks; women similarly had baseline and end-of-study biopsies. Endometrial biopsy samples were available for 668 women at baseline and end of study, with sufficient material for analysis.

- **Results**: Endometrial atrophy or inactive endometrium was found in all 668 women treated with intravaginal DHEA. Similar atrophy was observed in 119 of 121 participants with sufficient material for analysis who received placebo.

- **Conclusions**: After cessation of estradiol secretion by the ovaries at menopause, the estrogens made by mechanisms of intracrinology are inactivated intracellularly at their site of formation and action, thus maintaining serum estradiol at biologically inactive concentrations to avoid stimulation of the endometrium. The absence of enzymes that are able to transform DHEA into estrogens in the endometrium explains the typical endometrial atrophy in all normal postmenopausal women in the presence of variable concentrations of circulating endogenous DHEA. According to these mechanisms, the inactive sex steroid precursor DHEA administered intravaginally acts exclusively in the vagina.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111n8wfL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. In addition, increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause. Premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause include both spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (idiopathic; caused by chromosomal and genetic defects; associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, and environmental factors) and induced ovarian failure resulting from interventions (pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgical oophorectomy, including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations).

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%; younger than 30 years, 0.1%; and younger than 20 years, 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^117GX1vK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations regarding other androgenic preparations**: Systemic dehydroepiandrosterone is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and cannot be recommended for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone has not been tested and thus cannot be recommended for treatment of HSDD (Expert Opinion).

- **Recommendations regarding the design of future trials of physiologically dosed testosterone (Expert Opinion for all)**: More adequately powered, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs), without selection bias and with consistent reporting of standardized outcomes, are needed to comprehensively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women. For studies of testosterone and female sexual dysfunction (FSD): Relief of the distress associated with sexual dysfunction is a primary aim of FSD treatment. Presently, no questionnaire covers all domains of female sexual function, necessitating the use of a combination of domains from different questionnaires. Satisfying sexual events should no longer be used as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials of women with FSD. A set of clearly defined core outcomes needs to be established. There is a need for an instrument to assess sexual function with the following characteristics: general applicability, not disease-specific, high discriminant validity between women diagnosed with FSD and sexually functional women, and validated to measure FSD per se, as well as an instrument to screen for and diagnose FSD.

### Low dose dehydroepiandrosterone affects behavior in hypopituitary androgen-deficient women: a placebo-controlled trial [^11382k61]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). High credibility.

Thirty-eight women, aged 25–65 years, with androgen deficiency due to hypopituitarism were treated with oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 30 mg/day if ≥ 45 years of age) for six months in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, followed by a six-month open treatment period. The administration of DHEA raised the serum levels of DHEAS to normal age-related reference ranges and increased androstenedione and testosterone to subnormal levels.

Androgen effects on skin and/or pubic and/or axillary hair were observed in 84% (32 of 38) of the women after all received six months of DHEA treatment. No such effects were observed after the placebo treatment. These effects after six months were correlated with the serum levels of DHEAS (r = 0.37; P = 0.03), androstenedione (r = 0.42; P = 0.01), and testosterone (r = 0.37; P = 0.03).

The percentages of partners who reported improved alertness, stamina, and initiative by their spouses were 70%, 64%, and 55%, respectively, in the DHEA group and 11%, 6%, and 11%, respectively, in the placebo group (P < 0.05). According to the partners, sexual relations tended to improve compared with placebo (P = 0.06).

After six months of treatment, increased sexual interest or activity was reported by 50% of the women taking 30 mg DHEA, by none taking 20 mg DHEA, and by two women taking placebo (P = NS). Compared with levels after placebo administration, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 levels decreased after DHEA. Serum concentrations of IGF-I, serum markers of bone metabolism, and bone density did not change.

### Oral dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation modulates spontaneous and growth hormone-releasing hormone-induced growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion in early and late postmenopausal women [^112tfgT8]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on the growth hormone-releasing hormone-growth hormone (GHRH-GH) axis in lean and obese postmenopausal women, a prospective study was conducted in a clinical research environment. Thirty-one postmenopausal women, divided into two groups by age (50 to 55 and 60 to 65 years), including both lean and obese patients, participated in the study.

- **Interventions**: All patients underwent hormonal evaluations before and at the third and sixth month of therapy, which included 50 mg of DHEA administered orally each day, and a GHRH test (1 microg/kg) before and at the sixth month of treatment. Ultrasound and bone mass density (BMD) examinations were performed before and after the sixth month of therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Plasma concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), E1, E2, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), osteocalcin, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were measured.

- **Results**: The levels of all steroids derived from DHEA metabolism (E1, E2, A, T, DHEAS) and osteocalcin increased in plasma under DHEA supplementation. The supplementation protocol also increased the levels of GH and IGF-1. However, GHRH-induced GH and IGF-1 responses were not modified by DHEA supplementation.

- **Conclusions**: Administration of DHEA significantly affects several endocrine parameters in early and late postmenopausal women independently from body mass index. The data support the hypothesis that DHEA treatment acts similarly to estrogen-progestin replacement.

### Endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone and depression in postmenopausal women: A systematic review of observational studies [^116ByiyR]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

The associations between endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), and depression in older women are uncertain. However, DHEA supplements are widely available over the counter in some countries, and some people may be taking DHEA with the hope of positive mood effects.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between endogenous DHEA/DHEAS blood concentrations and depression/depressive symptoms in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for observational studies with at least 100 community-dwelling participants until March 9, 2022. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were manually searched. The studies published in English and meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The risk of bias was assessed with the modified Hoy tool for cross-sectional designs and the Joanna Briggs Institute modified critical appraisal checklist for cohort studies.

Of the 30 articles retrieved for full-text review, 14 met the criteria for inclusion. Seven studies were cross-sectional, six were longitudinal, and one had both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Five of eight cross-sectional studies found no association between DHEAS and depression, whereas three studies reported an inverse association. Similarly, most of the studies (n = 4) with longitudinal data reported no association, whereas two studies reported either an inverse association or mixed results for DHEAS and depression severity.

### The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS) on the contraction responses of the clitoral cavernous smooth muscle from female rabbits [^115CkgkH]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a multifunctional steroid that is increasingly available as a supplement aimed at improving libido and well-being in postmenopausal women. Together with its sulfate version, DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS), it is the most abundant steroid in humans. The clitoris is an important component of the female sexual response, characterized by increased vascular response during sexual arousal resulting in erection.

- **Aims**: To elucidate the direct effects of DHEA/DHEAS on the vasomotor reactivity of the rabbit clitoral cavernosum.

- **Methods**: Twenty New Zealand white female rabbits, weighing approximately 2.5–3 kg, were used in the study.

- **Main outcome measures**: The contractile response of clitoral cavernous smooth muscle strips in response to phenylephrine (PE; 10⁻⁹-10⁻⁴ M) was observed in rabbits. Additionally, DHEA/DHEAS effects on phenylephrine-induced contraction and/or acetylcholine-induced relaxation of phenylephrine-induced contraction were measured.

- **Results**: DHEA/DHEAS did not elicit any remarkable response in the resting state. However, both DHEA and DHEAS evoked dose-dependent relaxations of PE-induced contraction. The contractile responses to high potassium were significantly decreased in the DHEA/DHEAS-pretreated strips compared with the DHEA/DHEAS-nontreated strips. Additionally, contractions by Bay K 8644 (10⁻⁷-10⁻⁶ M) treatment were significantly inhibited by DHEA/DHEAS. DHEA-induced relaxation responses were stronger than DHEAS-induced relaxation responses. Various K channel blockers, tetraethylammonium…

### Lack of dehydroepiandrosterone effect on a combined endurance and resistance exercise program in postmenopausal women [^116nnizk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Recent studies have disputed the widely promoted anti-aging effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation. Conflicting data exist on whether physiological DHEA supplementation enhances exercise training effects on body composition, physical performance, and cardiometabolic risk in healthy postmenopausal women.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to determine whether 12 weeks of DHEA supplementation (50 mg/d) in postmenopausal women enhances exercise-related changes in body composition, physical performance, and cardiometabolic risk.

- **Design and setting**: This study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Mayo Clinic General Clinical Research Center in Rochester, MN.

- **Participants**: Thirty-one sedentary, postmenopausal, Caucasian women (mean ± SEM age 64.6 ± 1.0 years) completed the study.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomized to one of two 12-week interventions: 1) exercise training plus 50 mg/d of DHEA (n = 17), or 2) exercise training plus placebo (n = 14). The exercise intervention consisted of both endurance (4 days/week) and resistance (3 days/week) exercise components.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes were measures of body composition, physical performance, and measures of cardiometabolic risk.

- **Results**: DHEA treatment with exercise resulted in increases in circulating sulfated DHEA (650%), total testosterone (100%), estradiol (165%), estrone (85%), and IGF-I (30%); all P ≤ 0.05 for all within and between treatment comparisons. Although exercise training alone significantly improved physical performance.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116nZM2m]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that hormone therapy (HT) may slightly improve sexual functioning. This potential small benefit should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms. Future research should consider the role of HT as one component of a more holistic approach to managing low sexual functioning in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis update [^1176hZkb]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Data extraction and management were carried out by the first author in consultation with the final author. For studies with multiple publications, the main trial report served as the reference, and secondary articles were used for additional details. Data were extracted as mean ± SD. Standard errors and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were converted to SDs. Data reported as median (interquartile range) were converted using formulas assuming a normal distribution of the data.

- **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**: The risk-of-bias assessment was conducted by the first author, in consultation with the final author, utilizing the ROB.2 tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Bias arising from the randomization process (domain 1) was assessed at the study level, whereas all other domains were assessed at the outcome level. Each domain was rated as "low", "some concerns", or "high" risk of bias. An overall risk of bias was deemed "low" if all five domains were rated "low". If one to three domains were rated as having "some concerns" with all other domains rated "low", the overall risk of bias was considered "some concerns". Conversely, if four or more domains were rated as having "some concerns", or if one or more domains were rated "high", the overall risk of bias was "high". With regard to bias due to missing outcome data (domain 3), data were considered available for all or nearly all participants when at least 95% of randomized participants had outcome data. Differences in proportions of missing data between groups were considered significant if they were at least 5%.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During menopause, a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general well-being and sexual function, for example, libido, dyspareunia, and satisfaction. Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review aims to clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomized controlled trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

- **Search methods**: The databases searched on June 3, 2014, with no language restrictions applied, were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS. Conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge were also searched. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers, and reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^113fDms3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Measures of treatment effect:

- **Continuous data**: We will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way, such as HDL cholesterol. If the same outcome is reported on different scales, like quality of life, we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). To ensure consistency across trials, we will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required. Ordinal data will be treated as continuous data, and we will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

- **Dichotomous data**: We will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

- **Multiple groups within a study**: If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention, such as two different doses, we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

In situations where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data, such as the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and the number of people in each group. If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD from other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, or P (probability) values.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113stVjP]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured, as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone.

Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels, testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

### Role of estrogens and estrogen-like compounds in female sexual function and dysfunction [^116ngBNE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sex steroids are important in female sexual function and dysfunction. The aim of this study was to review the role of estrogens in the physiology and pathophysiology of female sexual functioning and to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of estrogen therapy for female sexual dysfunction. This research updates the previously published International Society of Sexual Medicine Consensus on this topic.

- **Methods**: Panel members reviewed published literature using online databases for studies related to estrogen in female sexual function and dysfunction. Special attention was given to clinical trials reporting on sexual function outcomes in women treated with estrogen.

- **Main outcome measures**: The quality of data published in the literature and recommendations were based on the GRADES system.

- **Results**: Observational studies considering relationship factors and physical or mental health reported that these factors contribute more to sexual functioning than menopausal status or estrogen levels. Few clinical trials have investigated estrogen therapy with sexual function as a primary outcome. The available data do not support systemic estrogen therapy for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction. However, topical vaginal estrogen therapy improves sexual function in postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and is considered first-line treatment for VVA. Oral ospemifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is effective for the treatment of VVA and might have independent systemic effects on female sexual function.

- **Conclusion**: For sexual problems, the treatment of VVA remains the most effective.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement therapy in older adults: 1- and 2-year effects on bone [^113vbJyU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Age-related reductions in serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations may be involved in bone mineral density (BMD) losses.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine whether DHEA supplementation in older adults improves BMD when co-administered with vitamin D and calcium.

- **Design**: In year 1, a randomized trial was conducted in which men (n = 55) and women (n = 58) aged 65–75 years took 50 mg/day oral DHEA supplements or placebo. In year 2, all participants took open-label DHEA (50 mg/day). During both years, all participants received vitamin D (16 micrograms/day) and calcium (700 mg/day) supplements. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Concentrations of hormones and bone turnover markers were measured in serum.

- **Results**: In men, no difference between groups occurred in any BMD measures or bone turnover markers during year 1 or year 2. The free testosterone index and estradiol increased in the DHEA group only. In women, spine BMD increased by 1.7 ± 0.6% (P = 0.0003) during year 1 and by 3.6 ± 0.7% after 2 years of supplementation in the DHEA group; however, in the placebo group, spine BMD was unchanged during year 1 but increased to 2.6 ± 0.9% above baseline during year 2 after the crossover to DHEA. Hip BMD did not change. Testosterone, estradiol, and insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the DHEA group only. In both groups, serum concentrations of bone turnover markers decreased during year 1 and remained low during year 2, but did not differ between groups.

- **Conclusion**: DHEA supplementation in older women, but not in men, improves spine BMD.

### Pharmacokinetics of dehydroepiandrosterone and its metabolites after long-term oral dehydroepiandrosterone treatment in postmenopausal women [^116FNw2S]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Some postmenopausal women use over-the-counter dehydroepiandrosterone because of its purported beneficial effects. Although it does not have major inherent androgenic activity, it is metabolized into potent androgens and estrogens. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of dehydroepiandrosterone and its relevant metabolites following prolonged treatment of postmenopausal women with 25 mg/day of dehydroepiandrosterone.

- **Methods**: Twenty healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to receive either 25 mg/day of dehydroepiandrosterone or a placebo for six months. Frequent blood samples were obtained over 24 hours on day 1 and after 3 and 6 months.

- **Results**: Mean baseline androgen levels on day 1 and at month 3 in the treated group (seven evaluable women) were as follows: dehydroepiandrosterone, 1.82 and 3.56 ng/mL; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 0.96 and 3.37 µg/mL; 5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol, 0.32 and 0.66 ng/mL; androstenedione, 0.50 and 0.86 ng/mL; testosterone, 17.9 and 28.7 ng/dL; dihydrotestosterone, 6.91 and 17.4 ng/dL; 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide, 2.66 and 10.7 ng/mL, respectively. These increases were significant. Small changes (-6% to 16%) were observed from month 3 to month 6. Nonsignificant increases were noted in baseline estrone and estradiol levels and in Cmax and AUC0–24h values for the androgens and estrogens from day 1 to months 3 and 6 of treatment. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were unchanged, but free testosterone increased significantly from day 1 to month 3. Baseline hormone levels did not increase in the placebo group (six evaluable women).
