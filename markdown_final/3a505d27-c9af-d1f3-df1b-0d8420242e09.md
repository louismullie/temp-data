## Question

A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with a transient episode of right arm weakness and expressive aphasia that resolved within 30 minutes. Carotid duplex ultrasound reveals a 75% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The patient is currently neurologically intact. The vascular surgery team is consulted for further management.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended process for determining the most appropriate management strategy (carotid endarterectomy, carotid artery stenting, or optimal medical therapy) for this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended process for determining the most appropriate management strategy for a 68-year-old man with a recent TIA and 75% left internal carotid artery stenosis, including whether to pursue carotid endarterectomy, carotid artery stenting, or optimal medical therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and symptom classification. Then, I should verify the stenosis severity and imaging quality. Next, I will assess perioperative risk and patient-specific factors that influence modality choice. After that, I need to weigh benefits and risks of CEA, CAS, and medical therapy against contemporary evidence. Finally, I will integrate timing, shared decision-making, and a practical recommendation with surveillance plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. A transient episode of right arm weakness and expressive aphasia resolving within 30 minutes meets the definition of a transient ischemic attack, and because it occurred within the last 6 months, this is symptomatic carotid artery stenosis rather than asymptomatic disease, which changes the threshold and urgency of revascularization compared with asymptomatic cases [^113i8DvV] [^115SosfN].

> Wait, let me verify the stenosis severity and imaging modality. Carotid duplex ultrasound showing 75% stenosis is significant, but I should confirm with a second noninvasive modality such as CTA or MRA when the result will change management, because ultrasound alone can misclassify severity in a meaningful minority of cases and guidelines endorse confirmatory imaging for symptomatic patients being considered for intervention [^111QKDh4] [^1161Fyq6].

> I need to check perioperative risk and patient-specific factors that influence the choice between CEA and CAS. Age 68, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are common and not absolute contraindications to CEA; however, I should screen for cardiac disease, prior neck surgery or radiation, lesion anatomy, and life expectancy, and ensure that if revascularization is pursued, it is performed by operators with established periprocedural stroke and death rates less than 6% for symptomatic patients, as outcomes are operator- and center-dependent [^113i8DvV] [^115D1uD3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asymptomatic thresholds. I initially thought the 75% stenosis might place him in an asymptomatic category, but that would be incorrect here because he had a TIA within 6 months, so this is symptomatic disease where the intervention threshold is 50% or greater stenosis, not 60% or 70% as in asymptomatic disease, and the benefit of CEA is greatest when performed within 14 days of the index event [^113i8DvV] [^115SosfN].

> Next, I should review the comparative benefits and risks of CEA, CAS, and medical therapy. For symptomatic patients with 70–99% stenosis, CEA provides substantial absolute risk reduction in recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone, with the clearest benefit in severe stenosis and when surgery is performed early after the ischemic event, whereas CAS is a reasonable alternative when surgical risk is high or anatomy is unfavorable for CEA, albeit with a higher periprocedural stroke risk and lower myocardial infarction risk than CEA in pooled analyses [^1127GEAm] [^113i8DvV] [^114jjSPE].

> I should double-check timing because it meaningfully alters benefit. The AHA/ASA recommends CEA or CAS as soon as the patient is neurologically stable, ideally within 14 days of the TIA, as the relative risk reduction wanes with delay; this argues for expedited confirmation of stenosis and early referral rather than prolonged observation once the diagnosis is secure [^113i8DvV] [^1132RUPk].

> Let me consider medical therapy if revascularization is deferred or contraindicated. Regardless of intervention, all patients should receive intensive medical therapy including high-intensity statin with LDL target less than 70 mg/dL, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization if present, lifestyle modification, and antiplatelet therapy; in the early phase after TIA, short-course dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21–90 days can be considered in noncardioembolic patients, balancing bleeding risk, while long-term single antiplatelet therapy is standard otherwise [^1167voJ3] [^114yCNcp] [^114jjSPE].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid surgery and opts for stenting? I should confirm candidacy for CAS by ensuring favorable anatomy, acceptable periprocedural risk, and operator experience, recognizing that in patients over 70 and in early post-TIA windows, CEA may carry lower periprocedural stroke risk than CAS; shared decision-making should explicitly discuss these trade-offs and the patient's preferences [^113i8DvV] [^114jjSPE].

> I will now examine the role of multidisciplinary review. Given variability in anatomy, comorbidity, and local expertise, a neurovascular team including vascular surgery, neurology, interventional radiology, and anesthesia can align the modality choice with patient-specific risk and institutional outcomes, which improves adherence to guideline-concordant care and individualizes therapy [^111fq1cE] [^112JZWq1].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. First, confirm the TIA diagnosis and symptom-to-lesion localization with brain imaging and ECG to exclude hemorrhage and atrial fibrillation. Second, verify the 75% stenosis with CTA or MRA and correlate with symptoms. Third, stratify perioperative risk and screen for high-risk features that would favor CAS over CEA. Fourth, if low surgical risk, proceed with CEA within 14 days; if high surgical risk or unfavorable anatomy, consider CAS with experienced operators. Fifth, if revascularization is deferred, implement intensive medical therapy and close follow-up with surveillance imaging. Throughout, engage the patient in shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and timing [^111QKDh4] [^113i8DvV] [^1167voJ3].

> Final recommendation: For this 68-year-old man with a recent TIA and 75% left ICA stenosis, I recommend confirming the stenosis with CTA or MRA and, if confirmed, proceeding with carotid endarterectomy within 14 days given low anticipated surgical risk, while initiating intensive medical therapy now; if CEA is contraindicated or the patient strongly prefers a minimally invasive approach, CAS is a reasonable alternative in experienced hands, with explicit counseling about higher periprocedural stroke risk and the importance of operator and center outcomes [^113i8DvV] [^1127GEAm] [^114jjSPE].

---

This patient has symptomatic carotid stenosis (TIA with 75% left ICA stenosis) [^113i8DvV], so **CEA is first-line** if perioperative risk is low and the procedure can be done within 14 days [^1132RUPk] [^116YF1tM]. If CEA is high risk or contraindicated, **CAS is reasonable** with operators achieving < 6% periprocedural stroke/death [^116BXa62] [^115D1uD3]. Optimal medical therapy is mandatory for all patients, including high-intensity statin, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet therapy [^1167voJ3] [^114jjSPE]. Shared decision-making is essential to weigh benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^117JLV75].

---

## Step 1: confirm diagnosis and symptom status

Confirm the diagnosis of TIA and classify the stenosis as symptomatic (within 6 months) [^113i8DvV] [^115SosfN]. Also **confirm stenosis severity** with duplex ultrasound and corroborate with CTA or MRA if results will alter management [^111QKDh4] [^1161Fyq6].

---

## Step 2: initiate optimal medical therapy immediately

Start **high-intensity statin therapy** (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg) to achieve LDL < 70 mg/dL [^114jjSPE]. Initiate or optimize antihypertensive therapy to a target of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. Begin **antiplatelet therapy** — aspirin 75–325 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily; consider dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 21–90 days in high-risk scenarios, balancing bleeding risk [^114yCNcp] [^113MyQpS].

---

## Step 3: assess perioperative risk and patient-specific factors

Evaluate **cardiac risk** (e.g. coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias) and pulmonary, renal, and age-related risks. Determine life expectancy and functional status to ensure benefit from intervention. Engage in shared decision-making to discuss risks, benefits, and patient preferences [^117JLV75].

---

## Step 4: determine candidacy for carotid endarterectomy (CEA)

CEA is **indicated** for symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% stenosis if perioperative risk is low and the procedure can be performed within 14 days [^113i8DvV] [^116YF1tM]. The benefit is greatest for severe (70–99%) stenosis and diminishes with delay [^1127GEAm].

---

## Step 5: consider carotid artery stenting (CAS) if CEA is contraindicated

CAS is reasonable for symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% stenosis who are **high surgical risk** or have anatomical contraindications to CEA, provided operators achieve < 6% periprocedural stroke/death [^116BXa62] [^115D1uD3]. CAS may be preferred in patients with prior neck surgery, radiation, or restenosis [^11753Rzz].

---

## Step 6: multidisciplinary team review

A **multidisciplinary team** (vascular surgery, neurology, interventional radiology, cardiology) should review imaging, risk factors, and patient preferences to reach consensus on CEA, CAS, or medical therapy alone [^111fq1cE].

---

## Step 7: timing of intervention

If revascularization is chosen, **perform CEA or CAS as soon as feasible**, ideally within 14 days of the TIA, to maximize benefit [^113i8DvV] [^1132RUPk].

---

## Step 8: surveillance and follow-up

If medical therapy alone is chosen, **obtain carotid duplex ultrasound every 6–12 months** to monitor progression [^116vyq26]. Maintain aggressive risk-factor control and reinforce adherence.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Indication** | **Timing** | **Perioperative risk threshold** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CEA | Symptomatic ≥ 50% stenosis, low surgical risk | Within 14 days | < 6% stroke/death |
| CAS | Symptomatic ≥ 50% stenosis, high surgical risk or CEA contraindicated | Within 14 days | < 6% stroke/death |
| Medical therapy alone | High surgical risk, patient preference, or < 50% stenosis | Immediate | N/A |

---

CEA is **first-line** for symptomatic 75% stenosis if perioperative risk is low and can be done within 14 days; CAS is an alternative when CEA is high risk, and optimal medical therapy is essential for all patients [^113i8DvV] [^116BXa62] [^1167voJ3].

### Time to rethink management strategies in asymptomatic carotid artery disease [^114fAekx]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Despite level I evidence, no worldwide consensus of opinion exists on how best to manage patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease. In this article, I present the evidence supporting intervention in these patients, highlighting a number of 'inconvenient truths' that challenge the current 'one size fits all' approach to treatment. I will demonstrate that, even if one could identify and treat every individual with a 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis, > 95% of all strokes will still occur. Evidence shows that 94% of all carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting procedures in asymptomatic patients in the US are ultimately unnecessary, costing health-care providers US$2 billion annually. Evidence also exists that the risk of stroke in patients treated medically is lower than when the asymptomatic trials were recruiting, challenging the appropriateness of basing contemporary guidelines upon historical data. A small cohort of 'high-risk for stroke' patients will undoubtedly benefit from intervention and our goal must be to identify and treat these individuals, rather than continuing with a policy of mass intervention that benefits very few patients in the long term.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### Management of asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis [^114ZxHhn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis remains unclear. Although 2 high-quality randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in ispsilateral stroke rates in patients without symptoms after carotid endarterectomy, medical therapy of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has reduced rates of stroke to approximately 1% per year, raising questions about the generalizability of these previous trials to current medical practice. However, reductions in adverse events after revascularization can make revascularization more attractive. The emergence of percutaneous revascularization for carotid artery stenosis has raised further questions about optimal management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. This Grand Rounds summarizes the factors to consider when counseling patients and making clinical decisions regarding medical therapy and revascularization for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. This information should provide clinicians with the knowledge base to counsel patients about the risks and benefits of treatment options.

Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACS) — screening and initial management: In the asymptomatic population, routine screening for carotid artery stenosis is not recommended to reduce the risk of stroke. In patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACS) > 70%, shared decision-making between the patient and the health care team to decide between the 2 courses of treatment (carotid revascularization or medical management) is recommended to determine the best method of reducing stroke risk. In patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis, medical treatment with statin can be beneficial to reduce the risk of stroke. In patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis > 70% and low perioperative risk, the use of carotid revascularization, in addition to intensive medical therapy, may be reasonable to reduce the risk of stroke.

Discussion

These results support the association of guideline-concordant processes with improved outcomes for patients with TIA and nonsevere ischemic stroke. The 6 without-fail care processes (ie, brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, antihypertensive intensification, high- or moderate-potency statin therapy, antithrombotics, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation) can be provided routinely at diverse medical centers because they do not require specialized structures of care. Given the strength of the prospective trial evidence as well as the current findings supporting the association of these processes with improved outcomes, health care systems should prioritize providing patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke with the guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible.

The individual processes that were associated with improved outcomes included carotid stenosis management, hyperlipidemia, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antithrombotics, and neurology consultation. These data support the AHA/ASA secondary prevention recommendations. Although carotid artery screening and intervention for symptomatic carotid stenosis are endorsed by guidelines, these processes are not currently the focus of existing quality measurement programs.

### Carotid endarterectomy as the criterion standard in high-risk elderly patients… [^115y8BJz]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The degree of carotid artery stenosis as classified by patient symptomatic status. In the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, most of the carotid lesions were described as having greater than 90% stenosis. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Results One hundred seventeen CEAs were performed in 110 patients 75 years or older. Significant medical comorbidities were well represented among the group. Among the patients, 50. 4% were symptomatic,
60. 7% had greater than 90% carotid stenosis, and 44. 4% had contralateral disease. Primary outcome for any stroke, death, or MI was 1. 7%,
0. 9%, or 3. 4%, respectively, with a composite event rate of any stroke or death of
2. 6%. One or more secondary outcomes were experienced by 26. 5% of patients. Conclusions. Strokes were characterized as ipsilateral or contralateral to the distribution of the carotid artery that underwent the intervention.

Myocardial infarctions included Q-wave and non–Q-wave events and were diagnosed by electrocardiographic changes and/or elevations of plasma cardiac enzyme levels. Death was differentiated as being stroke or non–stroke related. Cerebrovascular disease was symptomatic in 50. 4% of patients, with transient ischemic attacks being the most frequent presentation in
36. 8%, followed by nondisabling stroke in 14. 5%. Fifty-two patients had contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis, defined as at least 50% stenosis. The percentage of stenosis was stratified into the following 3 categories: 50% to 69%, 70% to 89%, and 90% or greater. Seventy-two procedures were performed on patients with more than 90% stenotic lesions. Most of the procedures were performed on more than 90% stenotic lesions in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.

All patients underwent preoperative carotid duplex ultrasonography, which was the sole modality used to assess extracranial carotid disease in 58. 1% of patients. Two cases were emergent, one for crescendo transient ischemic attacks and the other for stroke in evolution. Fourteen patients had a hostile neck: prior neck surgery was the reason in 10 cases, spinal immobility in 1, and prior neck irradiation in 3. In
4. 3% of the CEAs, the indication was recurrent carotid stenosis. There was 1 Q-wave MI and 3 non–Q-wave MIs, yielding incidences of total MI, Q-wave MI, and non–Q-wave MI of 3. 4%,
0. 9%, and 2. 6%, respectively. Three of the MIs were diagnosed on the basis of electrocardiographic changes and elevated plasma creatine kinase–MB enzyme fractions; the fourth was diagnosed on the basis of enzyme fractions alone. All patients were treated medically and subsequently discharged. The 1 ipsilateral stroke occurred in a man aged 81 years with 50% to 69% right internal carotid artery stenosis who presented with left-sided hemiparesis that worsened on heparin anticoagulation therapy. Duplex ultrasonography of the carotid artery showed an irregular ulcerated plaque with thrombus in the right carotid bifurcation. The patient had a history of bilateral CEAs for symptomatic disease. A reoperative CEA was performed with intraoperative shunting, but postoperatively the patient had a worsened left-sided hemiparesis and postoperative magnetic resonance angiography showed findings consistent with an extension of the right middle cerebral artery stroke. The only contralateral stroke occurred in an 81-year-old man who had more than 90% left internal carotid artery stenosis, 50% to 69% right internal carotid artery stenosis, and 70% to 89% bilateral common carotid artery stenosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with carotid artery stenosis (carotid artery stenting), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid artery stenting as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for stroke prevention in symptomatic patients at average or low risk of complications associated with endovascular interventions, if the internal carotid artery stenosis is ≥ 70% on noninvasive imaging or > 50% on catheter-based imaging and the anticipated rate of periprocedural stroke or death is < 6%, particularly in patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidities predisposing to cardiovascular complications with endarterectomy.

### Choosing the appropriate intervention for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease in the era of multiple therapies: integration of risk profile and technical data [^115pBtjB]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

With rapid evolution of endovascular techniques, carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Several investigations have been performed that examine the roles of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting and some trials have sought to compare the two treatment modalities. There have also been advances in the understanding of optimal medical management of carotid artery stenosis. The obvious question that arises is what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis? The answer is not straightforward and requires an understanding of differential outcomes in select subgroups. A review of the major studies, including some of the most recent trials, will help to elucidate the optimal therapy.

Knowledge gaps and future research — management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: The efficacy of best medical management alone compared with carotid revascularization to reduce risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis > 70% should be assessed. The role of carotid revascularization in patients considered high-risk surgical candidates should be defined, and enhanced imaging modalities could provide detailed insights into plaque morphology, stability, and risk of rupture to aid risk stratification and decision-making. Sex-specific studies in women with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis are needed. Early evidence suggests that transcarotid artery revascularization might have a role in patients with ACS, but no RCT data exist comparing its outcomes with either transfemoral carotid stenting or CEA. Ultimately, shared decision-making is paramount in determining the best treatment approach for ACS, and there are no validated tools to precisely determine the optimal frequency of carotid duplex surveillance for patients with more severe stenosis, rapid progression, or high-risk plaque characteristics.

Carotid-related strokes can be largely prevented

Atherosclerotic carotid stenosis is a major, modifiable risk factor of ischaemic stroke. Stroke prevention strategies include screening, risk factor control, optimal medical therapy, and carotid revascularization for patients at increased stroke risk. Preventing carotid-related strokes is paramount, as once a disabling stroke occurs no treatment can currently reverse the cerebral tissue loss.

### USPSTF recommendations for screening for carotid stenosis to prevent stroke… [^112srasN]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A total of 34% of strokes are ischemic strokes resulting from carotid artery disease, with the remaining strokes coming from the vertebrobasilar territory, intracranial vessels, or the heart. 2 However, most individuals who experience these strokes do not have a moderate or higher stenosis that could have been detected and treated in advance of the stroke; only 14% of strokes result from thromboembolism from a previously asymptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery. 3 The remaining strokes occur in individuals with at most minor carotid narrowing who would not have been candidates for intervention. Furthermore, some of these 14% of individuals will experience a warning transient ischemic attack, leaving about 11% of individuals whose stroke is due to thromboembolism from a previously asymptomatic stenosis. 3 These are the individuals with stroke who could potentially benefit from prior carotid screening.

Given that only 11% of strokes are associated with previously undiagnosed carotid stenosis, the impact of ultrasonographic screening on overall stroke prevention is limited, but preventing stroke in individuals with previously undiagnosed carotid stenosis is important, particularly when effective therapies are available. Therefore, the goal of screening patients to find those with carotid narrowing has strong face validity, even with the need to screen a large number of people to identify those with the potential to benefit. However, it is widely estimated that only a small proportion of strokes can actually be prevented, in large part owing to logistics of screening and finding individuals with stenosis amenable to treatment. The 11% of potentially preventable strokes would need be identified among individuals who have antecedent carotid narrowing.

Overall, only 1% to 3% of individuals with stenosis have severe narrowing, 4, 5 so many individuals would have to be screened to identify the few who would potentially benefit from treatments. should be changed based on new interval evidence. 6, 7 Interval studies of treatment of greater than 70% carotid stenosis continue to suggest small benefit or no benefit compared with best medical therapy, and both procedures are associated with meaningful short-term. harms of postoperative stroke or death, estimated as occurring in 0. 5% to
5. 1% of patients from the methodologically diverse studies that were reviewed. 6, 7 No externally validated risk stratification tools were identified that could reliably distinguish between individuals who have asymptomatic but clinically important carotid artery stenosis vs individuals who do not, or that could assess the risk of stroke in an individual associated with carotid artery stenosis.

All reviewed studies included patients with higher risk, making extrapolation of results to asymptomatic, typical-risk populations difficult. 6, 7 The USPSTF found that the interval evidence did not provide a basis to change their recommendation against screening and issued the D recommendation based on evidence that the harms of screening for carotid artery stenosis in adults who are asymptomatic outweigh the benefits. 6, 7. The crux of the USPSTF rationale in this recommendation hinges on the harms of treatment, 6, 7 an important consideration given the large number of people who would have to be screened to identify a relatively small group of individuals with stenosis and the inevitable potential for some rate of overdiagnosis leading to overtreatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with carotid artery stenosis (carotid endarterectomy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to perform carotid endarterectomy to reduce the risk of future stroke, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, gender, and comorbidities, if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is < 6% in patients with a recent TIA and ipsilateral moderate (50–69%) carotid stenosis as documented by catheter-based imaging or noninvasive imaging.

### Clinical need, design, and goals for the carotid revascularization and medical management for asymptomatic carotid stenosis trial [^112SFNnE]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Prior clinical trials produced evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis that may not be appropriate for clinical decision-making today. High-quality patient outcomes data to allow informed decision making regarding the optimal management of high-grade asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis is lacking. The results of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study were published in 1995 based on a randomized patient enrollment in the 1990s. Outcomes after endarterectomy, stenting, and medical treatment for these patients have all improved in the subsequent 2 decades. Therefore, the time has come to test whether contemporary intensive medical therapy is an acceptable alternative to contemporary endarterectomy or stenting and is the rationale for the Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CREST-2) trial. This National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-sponsored prospective, multicenter clinical trial has the investigators, study teams, asymptomatic patients, and robust study design needed to provide these answers. Two randomized clinical trials are planned: carotid revascularization and intensive medical management versus medical management alone in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis randomize in a 1:1 ratio; the other trial will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to carotid stenting with embolic protection versus no stenting.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on management of transient ischaemic attack [^1161Fyq6]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present European Stroke Organisation Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) management guideline document is to provide clinically useful evidence-based recommendations on approaches to triage, investigation and secondary prevention, particularly in the acute phase following TIA. The guidelines were prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined TIA clinically and pragmatically for generalisability as transient neurological symptoms, likely to be due to focal cerebral or ocular ischaemia, which last less than 24hours. High risk TIA was defined based on clinical features in patients seen early after their event or having other features suggesting a high early risk of stroke (e.g. ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, or weakness or speech disturbance for greater than five minutes, or recurrent events, or significant ipsilateral large artery disease e.g. carotid stenosis, intracranial stenosis). Overall, we strongly recommend using dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin short term, in high-risk non-cardioembolic TIA patients, with an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, as defined in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We further recommend specialist review within 24hours after the onset of TIA symptoms. We suggest review in a specialist TIA clinic rather than conventional outpatients, if managed in an outpatient setting. We make a recommendation to use either MRA or CTA in TIA patients for additional confirmation of large artery stenosis of 50% or greater, in order to guide further management, such as clarifying degree of carotid stenosis detected with carotid duplex ultrasound. We make a recommendation against using prediction tools (eg ABCD2 score) alone to identify high risk patients or to make triage and treatment decisions in suspected TIA patients as due to limited sensitivity of the scores, those with score value of 3 or less may include significant numbers of individual patients at risk of recurrent stroke, who require early assessment and treatment. These recommendations aim to emphasise the importance of prompt acute assessment and relevant secondary prevention. There are no data from randomised controlled trials on prediction tool use and optimal imaging strategies in suspected TIA.

### ESC consensus statement on stroke risk management in carotid atherosclerotic disease: 10 key points [^116rteNB]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute carotid-related stroke should undergo emergency recanalization

Acute carotid-related strokes, including tandem lesions (extracranial carotid and intracranial occlusions), require immediate endovascular stroke treatment, akin to other cerebral large-vessel occlusions. Carotid-related transient ischaemic attacks demand urgent addressing of the underlying cause by performing urgent revascularization, as delaying intervention can result in preventable brain damage. The 'wait-and-see' strategy in such cases is detrimental, given the often progressive cerebral injury, substantial-risk of recurrent stroke and the fact that a substantial proportion of stroke victims would prefer death to their life after stroke.

### Clinical considerations in the management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^115g7Kie]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental findings pose considerable management dilemmas for the treating physician and psychological burden for the respective patient. With an aging population, more patients will be diagnosed with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. Patients will have to be counseled with regard to treatment options according to their individual risk profile and according to professionals' knowledge of evidence-based data derived from large randomized control trials. Treatment consensus has long been lacking for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis prior to any randomized controlled trials. Additionally, an individual's risk profile may be hard to assess according to knowledge gained from randomized controlled trials. Moreover, while earlier studies compared carotid endarterectomy and medical therapy, in the past years, a new therapeutic modality, carotid artery angioplasty and stenting, has emerged as a possible alternative. This has been evaluated in a recent randomized controlled trial, the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST), which compared carotid endarterectomy with angioplasty and stenting in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The following review summarizes current knowledge of the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment strategies to counsel patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Appropriateness of care: asymptomatic carotid stenosis including transcarotid artery revascularization [^114UMydS]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is one of the most common diagnoses treated by vascular specialists in the United States. The optimal management of carotid stenosis remains controversial, however, with notable variation surrounding diagnostic imaging modalities, longitudinal surveillance, medical therapies, and procedural interventions. Data from high-quality randomized controlled trials and observational studies form the foundation for current management paradigms and societal guidelines that inform clinical practice. Presently, a diagnosis of carotid disease is most often established with duplex ultrasound and supplemental cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography as needed to provide additional anatomic information. All patients with documented occlusive disease should receive goal-directed medical therapy with antiplatelet agents and a lipid-reduction strategy, most commonly with a statin. Those with severe carotid stenosis and an acceptable life expectancy may be considered for carotid artery revascularization. The proceduralist should optimally consider a shared decision-making approach in which the tradeoffs of revascularization can be carefully considered with the patient to optimize informed therapeutic decision making. In current practice, three distinct procedure options exist to treat carotid artery stenosis, including carotid endarterectomy, transfemoral carotid artery stenting, and transcarotid artery revascularization. It should be noted that each procedure, although often used interchangeably in most clinical settings, carry technical nuances and outcome disparities. In this review, each of these topics are explored and various approaches are outlined surrounding the appropriate use of treatments for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Risk of stroke in relation to degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^114Mt7EX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

On the basis of evidence from randomised controlled trials, current guidelines have omitted the degree of stenosis as a selection factor for surgical intervention in asymptomatic carotid disease, and uncertainties about patient selection might partly explain substantial variations in clinical practice, with more than 75% of all endarterectomies in the USA done in patients with asymptomatic disease, compared with 7% in the UK. We aimed to determine the association between the degree of asymptomatic stenosis and stroke risk by studying a population-based cohort of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke and were on contemporary medical treatment. We also did a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies comprising patients with medically treated asymptomatic stenosis, comparing trial cohorts and observational studies and taking into account other potentially confounding factors (eg, current smoking status, statin use, and duration of study follow-up).

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^112Ymh1w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — symptomatic moderate to severe carotid stenosis: In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Values statement: In recommending endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 50%) carotid stenosis, the committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing the outcome of stroke with the associated disability and morbidity and a relatively lower value on avoiding the downsides of endarterectomy (cost, perioperative complications such as death, and myocardial infarction). The guideline also notes that no data exist to support or refute the value of endarterectomy for the management of symptomatic patients with nonstenotic but severely ulcerated plaques, and that while there could be a subset of symptomatic patients with less than 50% stenosis that might benefit from CEA, current published data do not permit identification of such a cohort.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to synthesize the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests, externally validated risk-stratification tools, the benefits of treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAAS), the benefits from medications added to current standard medical therapy, and the harms of screening and treatment with CEA or CAAS.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. (D recommendation).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1127ojqQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for extracranial carotid disease — treatment selection and thresholds are as follows: The committee recommends carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the first-line treatment for most symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 60% to 99%. The periprocedural risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons, and CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^113juFsT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) appointed a committee of experts to formulate evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of carotid stenosis. In formulating clinical practice recommendations, the committee used systematic reviews to summarize the best available evidence and the GRADE scheme to grade the strength of recommendations (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations) and rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low quality). In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade carotid stenosis (< 50% in symptomatic and < 60% in asymptomatic patients), we recommend optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence). A possible exception includes patients with ≥ 80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — carotid endarterectomy recommendation: In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). Evidence includes a systematic review/meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 5223 asymptomatic patients; stenosis thresholds were ≥ 50% in the Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study and ≥ 60% in ACAS and ACST. The incidence of 30-day perioperative stroke or death was 2.8%, and endarterectomy reduced risk versus medical therapy: relative risk 0.69 (0.57 to 0.83) for perioperative stroke, death or any subsequent stroke, and 0.71 (0.55 to 0.90) for perioperative stroke, death, or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, with no important inconsistency across trials (I2 = 0); for any stroke or death there was a nonsignificant trend favoring surgery (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). The committee placed a relatively higher value on preventing stroke disability and morbidity versus avoiding endarterectomy downsides, and in broader contexts clinicians should "consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2)".

### Systematic review of guidelines for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^1169B4xe]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We systematically compared and appraised contemporary guidelines on management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Methods

We systematically searched for guideline recommendations on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS) published in any language between January 1, 2008, and January 28, 2015. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 6 authors to determine clinical scenarios covered, recommendations given, and scientific evidence used.

Results

Thirty-four eligible guidelines were identified from 23 different regions/countries in 6 languages. Of 28 guidelines with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations, 24 (86%) endorsed CEA (recommended it should or may be provided) for ≈50% to 99% average-surgical-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 17 (61%) endorsed CAS, 8 (29%) opposed CAS, and 1 (4%) endorsed medical treatment alone. For asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients considered high-CEA-risk because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 13 guidelines (46%). Thirty-one of 33 guidelines (94%) with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations endorsed CEA for patients with ≈50% to 99% average-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 19 (58%) endorsed CAS and 9 (27%) opposed CAS. For high-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 27 guidelines (82%). Guideline procedural recommendations were based only on results of trials in which patients were randomized 12 to 34 years ago, rarely reflected medical treatment improvements and often understated potential CAS hazards. Qualifying terminology summarizing recommendations or evidence lacked standardization, impeding guideline interpretation, and comparison.

Conclusions

This systematic review has identified many opportunities to modernize and otherwise improve carotid stenosis management guidelines.

### Contemporary treatment of the asymptomatic carotid patient [^114YDXWs]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a persistent leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and carotid artery atherosclerosis remains a treatable cause of future stroke. Although most patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease may be at a relatively low risk for future stroke, most completed strokes are unheralded; thus, the identification and appropriate treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease remains a critical part of overall stroke prevention. Select patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with an increased risk of future stroke based on the degree of stenosis and other imaging or patient-related characteristics are appropriate to consider for carotid artery intervention.

### Roadmap consensus on carotid artery plaque imaging and impact on therapy strategies and guidelines: an international, multispecialty, expert review and position statement [^111FQCBp]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of stroke in patients with carotid atherosclerosis are based on the quantification of the degree of stenosis and symptom status. Recent publications have demonstrated that plaque morphology and composition, independent of the degree of stenosis, are important in the risk stratification of carotid atherosclerotic disease. This finding raises the question as to whether current guidelines are adequate or if they should be updated with new evidence, including imaging for plaque phenotyping, risk stratification, and clinical decision-making in addition to the degree of stenosis. To further this discussion, this roadmap consensus article defines the limits of luminal imaging and highlights the current evidence supporting the role of plaque imaging. Furthermore, we identify gaps in current knowledge and suggest steps to generate high-quality evidence, to add relevant information to guidelines currently based on the quantification of stenosis.

### Real-world experience of treatment decision-making in carotid stenosis in a neurovascular board [^112JZWq1]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe our experience with consensus-based decision-making for treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis by neurologists, interventional neuroradiologists, vascular surgeons, and neurosurgeons in a multidisciplinary neurovascular board and to study adherence to treatment recommendations in the context of uncertainty with respect to the best treatment option.

Methods

We established a multidisciplinary neurovascular board meeting twice a week with structured documentation of consensus decisions. Over a time period of 53 months, 614 cases with ICA stenosis were discussed, with 285 (46%) symptomatic and 279 (45%) asymptomatic cases.

Results

Recommendation for symptomatic ICA stenosis was revascularization in 76%, medical management alone in 8%, and further diagnostics in 16%. For asymptomatic ICA stenosis, recommendation was randomization in a clinical trial in 29%, revascularization in 27%, medical management alone in 23%, and further diagnostics in 22%. Treatment recommendations were followed in 94% of symptomatic ICA stenosis and 69% of asymptomatic ICA stenosis. Patients in whom carotid artery stenting was recommended for revascularization were younger and showed a higher rate of severe (≥ 70%) ICA stenosis.

Conclusions

Interdisciplinary board decisions are a helpful and transparent tool to assure adherence to guideline recommendations, and to provide consensus-based individualized treatment strategies in clinical practice in the absence of unequivocal evidence.

The risk of large-artery stroke increased with the degree of stenosis, but even in the 70% to 99% stenosis category, it only reached about one third of that in the symptomatic artery. Cardioembolic strokes. did not increase in the presence of increasing stenosis in the asymptomatic artery. The risk of lacunar strokes increased moderately. For symptomatic arteries with severe stenosis, the highest proportion of strokes were of large-artery origin. Of all strokes in the territory of a symptomatic 70%- to 99%-stenosed artery, 21. 6% were cardioembolic or lacunar in origin.

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid stenosis management — In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade disease, we recommend optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization for (< 50% in symptomatic and < 60% in asymptomatic patients) (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence), with a possible exception for patients with ≥ 80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy. Strength-of-recommendation and evidence-quality categories follow the GRADE scheme (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations; high, moderate, low, and very low quality).

### An international, multispecialty, expert-based Delphi consensus document on controversial issues in the management of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^111UQjkc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the publication of various national/international guidelines, several questions concerning the management of patients with asymptomatic (AsxCS) and symptomatic (SxCS) carotid stenosis remain unanswered. The aim of this international, multi-specialty, expert-based Delphi Consensus document was to address these issues to help clinicians make decisions when guidelines are unclear.

Methods

Fourteen controversial topics were identified. A three-round Delphi Consensus process was performed including 61 experts. The aim of Round 1 was to investigate the differing views and opinions regarding these unresolved topics. In Round 2, clarifications were asked from each participant. In Round 3, the questionnaire was resent to all participants for their final vote. Consensus was reached when ≥ 75% of experts agreed on a specific response.

Results

Most experts agreed that: (1) the current periprocedural/in-hospital stroke/death thresholds for performing a carotid intervention should be lowered from 6% to 4% in patients with SxCS and from 3% to 2% in patients with AsxCS; (2) the time threshold for a patient being considered "recently symptomatic" should be reduced from the current definition of "6 months" to 3 months or less; (3) 80% to 99% AsxCS carries a higher risk of stroke compared with 60% to 79% AsxCS; (4) factors beyond the grade of stenosis and symptoms should be added to the indications for revascularization in AsxCS patients (eg, plaque features of vulnerability and silent infarctions on brain computed tomography scans); and (5) shunting should be used selectively, rather than always or never. Consensus could not be reached on the remaining topics due to conflicting, inadequate, or controversial evidence.

Conclusions

The present international, multi-specialty expert-based Delphi Consensus document attempted to provide responses to several unanswered/unresolved issues. However, consensus could not be achieved on some topics, highlighting areas requiring future research.

### An assessment of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke [^114MfPmu]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare methods and key management recommendations from recent stroke prevention guidelines.

Methods

Systematic review of guidelines for prevention of ischemic stroke published in English between 1996 and 2001 was conducted, and recommendations were independently abstracted and compared.

Results

Among 22 stroke prevention guidelines, information was provided about panel selection in 24%, funding source in 36%, consensus methods in 33%, and quantitative risk/benefit estimates in 38%. Eleven recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke, but eight different sets of criteria to identify high-risk patients were proposed. Recommendations regarding carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis varied from general endorsement in a setting of low perioperative risk to routinely withholding surgery. All nine relevant guidelines endorsed aspirin in dosages between 50 and 325 mg/day for initial antiplatelet therapy following cerebral ischemia; six also suggested other antiplatelet agents as options for initial therapy.

Conclusions

Current stroke prevention guidelines do not provide adequate methodologic information to permit assessment of their quality, potential bias, and clinical applicability. Management recommendations are relatively consistent but differ in several important areas.

### Choice and selection of treatment modalities for cardiac patients: an interventional cardiology perspective [^115K1ceC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Besides the controversies that surround the management of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is even more controversial. In the current era of optimal medical therapy, the role of carotid revascularization by CAS or CEA is unclear and is being sought by the CREST‐2 trial. 45 Furthermore, there is ongoing controversy regarding the role of operator experience while comparing CAS and CEA, along with differing certification requirements for the 2 interventions. The rate of periprocedural stroke among symptomatic patients undergoing CAS was 6% in the CREST trial as compared to 9.6% in the EVA‐3S trial, 40, 43 emphasizing the importance of training, credentialing, and auditing the CAS operators.

So, how do we put all this information into perspective for decision‐making? Overall, it has been demonstrated that CAS and CEA are durable procedures that are effective in preventing major strokes that lead to death or disability in the majority of patients. CAS seems to have the disadvantage of causing minor nondisabling strokes in the postprocedural period and possibly in the long term. However, this increased risk of minor strokes must be weighed against the increased risk of MI, cranial nerve palsies, and access site complications associated with CEA. The choice between CAS and CEA should take into account the different procedure‐related risks, demographic characteristics such as age and sex, patient preferences, along with other comorbidities that may relatively or absolutely contradict a procedure. We have established that there is a complementary role for both CAS and CEA but have not been able to establish clearly as to who will benefit the most from which procedure. The risk–benefit issue is a little complex at the moment and should be discussed with patients in a transparent fashion to facilitate collaborative and individualized choice of treatment. The current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend CEA as the revascularization strategy of choice among low‐ or medium‐risk patients with significant carotid stenosis presenting with stroke or transient ischemic attack (Class I recommendation). 36 However, the guidelines also recognize CAS as an alternative to CEA (Class I recommendation) among patients who are at low risk for endovascular intervention, giving rise to controversy about patient selection. 36 Finally, the importance of optimal medical therapy and control of modifiable traditional cardiovascular risk factors cannot be ignored. However, according to the current guidelines, in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients at high risk of complications for carotid revascularization by either CEA or CAS because of comorbidities, the effectiveness of revascularization versus medical therapy alone is not well established. 36

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1152T395]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — three randomized clinical trials (n = 5226) of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (stenosis ≥ 50%) versus medical therapy over 2 to 9 years found that, compared with medical therapy alone, 2.0% fewer patients treated with CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke combined over 30 d and 3.5% fewer had perioperative stroke or death and any subsequent stroke combined; however, none of the trials focused on exclusively asymptomatic populations identified by primary care screening, between 20% and 32% of trial patients reported a history of contralateral artery transient ischemic attack, stroke, or CEA at baseline, requirements for asymptomatic status differed across trials (eg, no ipsilateral events for the past 6 months vs the past 45 days), medical therapy varied and operators were highly selected, and because of these limitations the USPSTF concluded that the magnitude of any benefit would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in the trials.

### Comparison of the five 2011 guidelines for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^112DowA2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, five independent, international guideline committees reported their recommendations for the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. These included the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society of Cardiology, the Australasian, and the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. As the recommendations of these five guideline committees were based on the same published literature, it would be expected that they are similar, at least to a large extent. Surprisingly, there were considerable differences between the five guidelines regarding the management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid patients. The differences in the recommendations between the five Guideline Committees are analyzed and discussed.

Neurologically asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 60% — carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic lesions: Controlled randomized trials have compared CEA with best medical therapy and the results of ACAS and ACST favored CEA. ACAS demonstrated the superiority of CEA over antiplatelet therapy alone for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of ≥ 60%, and this trial recommended CEA for these patients (aged < 80 years) as long as the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. In updated ACST I results, the patients in the CEA arm (aged < 75 years) experienced significantly lower perioperative and 10-year stroke rates (13.3% vs 17.9%). The question of whether modern medical therapy (including statins) is equivalent or superior to CEA or CAS has not yet been addressed by well-designed, appropriately funded, prospective, multicenter, and randomized trials.

Patient involvement in decisions regarding their care

The patient, holding a central position in the decision process regarding their care(Figure 1, top) requires full information about disease-related stroke risk and treatment options, including risks associated with the different treatments and their advantages. The viable treatment options should be discussed with the patient, thereby allowing fully informed decision-making. Involving the patient (and, with consent, their caregivers or family) in the decision-making process may also help with long-term adherence to medical therapy. Patient preferences, including the mode of revascularization (if indicated), should be respected.

### Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: time to rethink our therapeutic options? [^111cnhDt]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is a well-recognized risk factor for ischemic stroke, and its prevalence increases with age. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, well-designed randomized trials established a definite advantage for carotid endarterectomy in reducing the risk of ipsilateral stroke when compared with medical therapy alone. However, medical treatment of cardiovascular disease has improved significantly over the past 2 decades, and this has, in turn, resulted in a decline of the stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis treated medically. This improvement in medical therapy casts doubts on the effectiveness of large-scale invasive treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Several studies have been conducted to identify possible subgroups of patients with asymptomatic stenosis who are at higher risk of stroke in order to maximize the potential benefits of invasive treatment. Ongoing large-scale trials comparing best current medical therapy to available invasive treatments, such as carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting, are likely to shed some light on this debated topic in the near future. In this review, the authors summarize the current controversy surrounding the ideal management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

For asymptomatic patients with 70% to 99% diameter stenosis, there are insufficient data to recommend CAS as primary therapy; if CAS is undertaken by experienced interventionists, operators and institutions must meet established AHA standards and the combined stroke and death rate must be < 3% to ensure benefit (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B).

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1157zA9R]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112q3Ans]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published. Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized. The current publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas: imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis, medical therapy (as stand-alone management and also in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis), risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS), technical standards for performing CEA and CAS, the relative roles of CEA and CAS, and management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. CAS should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons. CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy.

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113hh5ED]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Carotid artery stenosis is atherosclerotic disease that affects extracranial carotid arteries. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis refers to stenosis in persons without a history of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other neurologic symptoms referable to the carotid arteries. The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is low in the general population but increases with age.

Objective

To determine if its 2014 recommendation should be reaffirmed, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence review. The reaffirmation update focused on the targeted key questions on the potential benefits and harms of screening and interventions, including revascularization procedures designed to improve carotid artery blood flow, in persons with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Population

This recommendation statement applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms referable to the carotid arteries.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and therefore concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. (D recommendation).

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113i8DvV]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — For patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), the guideline provides the following directives: In patients with a TIA or nondisabling ischemic stroke within the past 6 months and ipsilateral severe (70%–99%) carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, provided that perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis who are scheduled for carotid artery stenting (CAS) or CEA, procedures should be performed by operators with established periprocedural stroke and mortality rates of < 6% to reduce the risk of surgical adverse events; in patients with carotid artery stenosis and a TIA or stroke, intensive medical therapy with antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and treatment of hypertension, is recommended to reduce risk; in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral moderate (50%–69%) carotid stenosis as documented by catheter-based imaging or noninvasive imaging, CEA is recommended to reduce the risk of future stroke, depending on patient-specific factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities, if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is estimated to be < 6%; in patients > 70 years of age with stroke or TIA in whom carotid revascularization is being considered, it is reasonable to select CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate; and in patients in whom revascularization is planned within 1 week of the index stroke, it is reasonable to choose CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate.

### Evaluation of ischemic… [^113gbB2Y]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Evaluation of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease Accurate determination of the degree of carotid artery stenosis is important in the routine clinical assessment of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. This information determines whether surgical referral and subsequent intervention are warranted. High-resolution Doppler ultrasonography followed by three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography as needed provides excellent noninvasive assessment of the severity of carotid artery stenosis. 13 The use of valid criteria for detecting advanced-grade carotid artery stenosis is of the utmost importance. The presence of a flow gap on MRA is a reliable marker of carotid stenosis greater than 60 percent. 14 Duplex ultrasound criteria for a stenosis of 60 percent or greater result from combining a peak systolic velocity of 290 cm per second or more, or an end diastolic velocity of 80 cm per second or more.
15.

Surgical Treatment SYMPTOMATIC CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS Stroke is often caused by atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid artery bifurcation. The degree of internal carotid artery stenosis is the most important predictor of cerebral infarction among patients with extracranial carotid artery disease. 19 The severity of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis is directly related to the risk of stroke. Through the removal of atherosclerotic plaques, carotid endarterectomy restores cerebral blood flow and reduces the risk of cerebral ischemia. Results from three major prospective contemporary studies provide compelling evidence for the benefit of carotid endarterectomy, when performed by experienced surgeons, in improving the chance of stroke-free survival in high-risk symptomatic patients. 19–21 Subgroup analysis identified patient subgroups at variable risk for stroke.

Overall, an estimated eight carotid endarterectomies are required to prevent one stroke in symptomatic patients with severe carotid artery stenosis.
19. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. This trial 19 confirmed the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy in preventing stroke in 659 symptomatic patients who had TIAs or minor strokes with high-grade, diameter-reducing carotid artery stenosis. A uniform and strict technique for measuring carotid artery stenosis from an arteriogram was used in the trial. Summary Discussion. Among 374 symptomatic patients with mild stenosis, the ECST results favor the use of medical therapy with platelet antiaggregants.

20 The usefulness of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis of 30 to 69 percent has not yet been unequivocally determined. The ECST results were analyzed separately for patients with stenosis of 30 to 49 percent and those with stenosis of 50 to 69 percent. Analyses of 1, 599 patients treated in 97 hospitals in 15 countries suggest that carotid endarterectomy is not indicated in most of these patients.
23. Recent results in 2, 226 patients randomized to NASCET-22 4 show a relatively modest benefit favoring surgery in patients with stenosis of 50 to 69 percent, especially those with hemispheric ischemia or no history of diabetes. Carotid endarterectomy provided no benefit if stenosis was less than 50 percent. These results corroborate the observations made by ECST investigators 23.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^111TsPtw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease. A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. The committee recommends CEA as the first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 70% to 99%. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. In patients with recent stable stroke (modified Rankin scale score, 0–2), carotid revascularization is considered appropriate for symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and should be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable after 48 hours but definitely < 14 days after symptom onset. In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience.

In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B), though data from CREST suggest patients aged < 70 years may be better treated by CAS but need further confirmation. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ≥ 60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk, provided a 3- to 5-year life expectancy and periprocedural stroke/death rates ≤ 3% (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

Current guidelines

The guideline recommendations for the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis are listed in the online supplementary table. In general, current guidelines recommend OMT as an essential treatment for all patients with carotid artery stenosis, whereas symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and highly selected asymptomatic patients with > 60% stenosis be considered for additional interventional management if the estimated periprocedural complication rate is < 3%. The choice between CEA and CAS should be made after considering demographics (eg, age and gender), anatomic, clinical (eg, contralateral TIA/stroke) and imaging (ipsilateral silent infarction, stenosis progression, spontaneous embolisation on transcranial Doppler, impaired cerebral vascular reserve, large plaques and so on) features.

### Best medical therapy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: imminent or ineffective? [^113gC1CD]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery disease accounts for approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes, a major cause of morbidity, and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Landmark trials in the 1990s, such as Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, establish carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus best medical therapy (BMT) as the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis over 60%. However, advances in medical therapy and the emergence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) have prompted a reevaluation of treatment efficacy. Recent studies have questioned the superiority of CEA over BMT alone in reducing stroke risk, suggesting no significant difference in outcomes with contemporary medical management. In addition, analysis from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicated minimal net benefit of CEA over BMT when accounting for all-cause mortality. Comparative studies have found no significant difference in long-term stroke-free survival between CEA and CAS. However, procedural risks vary, with higher myocardial infarction rates associated with CEA and higher stroke rates with CAS. Identifying high-risk plaques and patient-specific risk factors remains crucial. Meta-analyses have highlighted features such as neovascularization and lipid rich cores as predictors of stenosis progression and ischemic events. Ongoing research, particularly the CREST-2 trial, aims to provide clear guidance on the optimal treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This trial emphasizes stringent adherence to modern BMT protocols and includes comprehensive lifestyle modification programs. The evolving landscape of medical and surgical interventions necessitates continuous evaluation to optimize treatment strategies for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, which is the impetus for this review. Future findings from ongoing trials are expected to refine current guidelines and improve patient outcomes.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to intracranial angioplasty/stenting, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that angioplasty or stenting in patients with a TIA attributable to moderate stenosis (50–69%) of a major intracranial artery is associated with excess morbidity and mortality compared with medical management alone.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^115HVvKk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery extracranial cerebrovascular disease guidelines — screening and combined carotid–coronary management: In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99% who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^117VJ25w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy — evidence limitations and NASCET exclusions: Carotid endarterectomy for nonhemispheric symptoms, vertebrobasilar symptoms, acute stroke, or for stroke or TIA with internal carotid occlusion is not supported by high quality evidence but rather by very low quality evidence (case series and unsystematic observations), and in these settings surgeon's complication rate and patient's values and preferences play a major role in decision making. NASCET withheld endarterectomy from patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and significant comorbid conditions and also excluded patients over the age of 79, those with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, and those without adequate angiographic visualization; accordingly, the net benefit in these populations is unclear, requiring judicious and selective application, and case by case decision-making with attention to patient values, surgeon experience, and surgical center outcomes.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^1127GEAm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017.

Objectives

To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient-years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high-quality evidence). Surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high-quality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near-occlusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate-quality evidence).

Stroke risk dictates management

There is a gradient of stroke risk with carotid stenosis(Figure 1, top). Patients at increased stroke risk should be evaluated for revascularization on top of risk factor modification and maximized medical therapy. Validated risk prediction scores (analogous to the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scale or mCARS scale for patients with atrial fibrillation) are needed for patients with CarAD. Key risk factors for CarAD include diabetes, hypertension, a history of cardiovascular disease, and dyslipidaemia. Selective screening for CarAD can enhance risk factor management and optimize medical therapy. Targeted screening programs in well-defined populations could provide significant public health benefits.

Figure 1
Stroke risk stratification determines management of carotid stenosis (top) and carotid revascularization risk reduction seen with technology advancements (bottom). The top graphic illustrates patient management in the context of the gradient of stroke risk with atherosclerotic carotid disease, from low to high. 'Significant' stenosis is typically defined as ≥ 50% reduction of the carotid artery luminal diameter, but plaque morphology emerges as an important determinant of stroke risk. Patients with increased stroke risk should be evaluated for revascularization on top of cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modification and optimized medical therapy. The decision on performing vs deferring revascularization should ideally be based on a multidisciplinary (Neurovascular Team) consensus statement. To assist the patient in their decision, the Neurovascular Team may also advise a preferred revascularization mode (according to patient-specific factors and local expertise). The patient, holding a central position in the decision process regarding their care, requires full information about disease-related stroke risk and treatment options, including risks associated with the different treatments and their advantages. The graphic in the bottom presents the key carotid revascularization studies of the last 5 years, grouped according to the revascularization technique used and gradient in risk of periprocedural stroke or death

Extracranial carotid stenosis — supportive evidence and adjunctive medical therapy: A combined analysis of the original carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials found robust benefit for CEA in severe (70%–99%) ICA stenosis with a 16.0% absolute benefit over 5 years. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).
