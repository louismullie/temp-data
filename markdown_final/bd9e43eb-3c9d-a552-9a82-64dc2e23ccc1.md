## Question

Current protocol for administration of magnesium sulfate in asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current protocol for administering magnesium sulfate in asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and where magnesium fits in the treatment pathway. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline positions for intravenous versus nebulized routes. Next, I will extract dosing, timing, and monitoring details from high-quality sources. After that, I need to consider special populations and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise protocol and note uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and where magnesium sulfate sits in acute asthma care. Magnesium sulfate is not first-line; it is an adjunct for severe exacerbations that fail to respond to initial inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, early systemic corticosteroids, and, when indicated, ipratropium, with consideration typically after about 1 hour of therapy if the patient remains in moderate to severe distress or has low lung function or hypoxemia, which aligns with GINA and primary care guidance on exacerbation management [^068ca0f3] [^5d6cd62d] [^be70d48d].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for intravenous magnesium sulfate in adults. The most consistent signal is a reduction in hospital admissions in severe exacerbations, supported by a 2014 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs showing an odds ratio of 0.75 for admission with IV magnesium, translating to about 7 fewer admissions per 100 treated, with additional improvements in lung function indices; this is high-quality evidence for the admission outcome, though heterogeneity exists and severity stratification matters [^ded677d5]. I should also note that the 3Mg trial did not show a statistically significant reduction in admission, but it excluded life-threatening features and may have been underpowered, so its negative result does not negate the Cochrane findings in truly severe presentations [^ddf20e5a].

> I need to check the pediatric data for IV magnesium. The Cochrane review of pediatric RCTs found a 68% reduction in hospitalization odds, but the total sample was small and confidence intervals are wide, so the certainty is low even though the effect size is large; nonetheless, this has been echoed by subsequent meta-analyses and reviews, and pediatric critical care guidelines increasingly suggest IV magnesium as an adjunct in critical asthma, reflecting a favorable risk–benefit profile despite limited high-certainty evidence [^94478874] [^b0ab2572] [^7a8c38c9] [^a38887f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nebulized magnesium. I initially thought nebulized magnesium might be broadly helpful, but I should double-check. The MAGNETIC trial in children showed only a small, non–clinically significant improvement in asthma severity at 60 minutes, with signals of benefit in the most severe subgroup and those with shorter symptom duration, which is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^abe3d030]. Multiple high-quality pediatric meta-analyses conclude that nebulized magnesium does not reduce asthma severity scores or hospitalizations, despite modest improvements in peak flow, so routine use is not supported in children [^7b144a3f] [^a15efe7f] [^d1078aa3]. In adults, the 3Mg trial found no benefit for nebulized magnesium, and Cochrane reviews suggest, at best, uncertain or limited benefit, so nebulized magnesium should not be used routinely [^ddf20e5a] [^d1acfc98].

> Let me consider dosing and administration details for IV magnesium, and I should confirm consistency across sources. Adult dosing is typically 2 g IV infused over 15–30 minutes, with the FDA label specifying 2 g over 15–30 minutes for severe asthma, and GINA recommending a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes in selected severe cases not responding to initial therapy [^eef2ec2a] [^068ca0f3]. Pediatric dosing is weight-based at 40–50 mg/kg, maximum 2 g, infused over 20–60 minutes, again as a single dose in the ED setting, with some pediatric studies exploring higher-dose continuous infusions in critical asthma, though that remains investigational and not standard ED practice [^86d5b40c] [^e0656b8a] [^abb55a64].

> I should confirm timing and triggers for administration. Magnesium is generally considered after about 1 hour of initial therapy if the patient remains in moderate to severe distress, has persistent hypoxemia, or has inadequate lung function response, with GINA explicitly recommending IV magnesium when FEV1 remains below about 25–30% predicted in adults or fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour in children, or when there is persistent hypoxemia despite oxygen and bronchodilators [^068ca0f3] [^7061f270]. Early administration has been associated with improved ED processes, but causality for outcomes remains uncertain, so I need to be cautious not to overstate early use benefits beyond workflow considerations [^285c706d].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. During infusion, monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure, and watch for flushing, warmth, nausea, headache, or fatigue; hypotension is usually mild and manageable with fluids or slower infusion, and serious adverse events are uncommon in trials and observational cohorts, though hypotension has been reported in a minority of pediatric cases, reinforcing the need for vigilance and appropriate patient selection [^ded677d5] [^6198067b] [^cf9d9848]. I need to ensure we avoid magnesium in patients with significant renal impairment or conduction abnormalities, and document any coexisting neuromuscular conditions that could potentiate magnesium effects.

> Let me synthesize a practical protocol while keeping the evidence caveats in mind. For adults with severe asthma not responding to initial SABA, early corticosteroids, and ipratropium, administer 2 g IV magnesium sulfate diluted in 100 mL normal saline over 20 minutes, reassessing symptoms, oxygenation, and lung function about 1–2 hours after completion to guide disposition; repeat dosing is not routine in the ED, though some protocols allow a second dose in critical asthma under specialist supervision [^068ca0f3] [^eef2ec2a]. For children with severe asthma not responding to initial therapy, give 40–50 mg/kg IV magnesium sulfate, maximum 2 g, over 20–60 minutes, and reassess clinically and with objective measures to decide on admission or further escalation; in critical asthma, pediatric critical care pathways suggest considering IV magnesium as an adjunct, acknowledging low-certainty evidence but favorable safety and potential benefits [^86d5b40c] [^7a8c38c9] [^a38887f4].

> But wait, what about nebulized magnesium in children — should I ever recommend it. GINA allows consideration of nebulized isotonic magnesium in children aged 2 years and older with severe exacerbations within the first hour, particularly when oxygen saturation is below 92% and symptoms are less than 6 hours, yet multiple high-quality pediatric meta-analyses show no consistent benefit on severity scores or hospitalization, so if considered, it should be framed as optional, low-certainty, and not a substitute for IV magnesium in refractory cases [^86d5b40c] [^7b144a3f] [^a15efe7f]. I should double-check that families understand this uncertainty before proceeding.

> I will now examine special populations and settings. In pregnancy, magnesium sulfate is commonly used for preeclampsia and has a known safety profile; while asthma data are limited, its physiologic rationale and safety support use in severe asthma exacerbations when indicated, with standard dosing and monitoring. In the ICU, continuous infusions have been studied in pediatric status asthmaticus, but evidence is limited and dosing is not standardized, so use should be guided by local protocols and specialist input [^e0656b8a] [^abb55a64] [^7a8c38c9].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and reconcile conflicting data. The most consistent, clinically meaningful benefit of IV magnesium is a reduction in hospital admissions in adults and children with severe exacerbations, with additional improvements in lung function in severe cases, whereas nebulized magnesium has not shown consistent benefits on hard outcomes and should not be used routinely; thus, magnesium sulfate is best reserved for severe, refractory exacerbations after initial therapy, with single-dose IV administration and careful monitoring, and shared decision-making about uncertain benefits in pediatrics [^ded677d5] [^94478874] [^068ca0f3] [^d1acfc98].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up are addressed. Record severity criteria, response to initial therapy, rationale for magnesium, dosing and timing, vitals during infusion, and post-infusion reassessment; upon discharge, reinforce controller therapy, provide an action plan, and arrange follow-up, as magnesium is an adjunct and does not replace comprehensive exacerbation prevention strategies [^068ca0f3] [^3ed126d8].

The current protocol for magnesium sulfate in asthma is to give **IV magnesium sulfate 2 g over 20 minutes** [^eef2ec2a] for adults with severe exacerbations who do not respond to initial bronchodilators and corticosteroids [^068ca0f3], as it reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function [^ded677d5]. For children, use **40–50 mg/kg (max 2 g) over 20–60 minutes** [^86d5b40c] in severe cases [^94478874]. Nebulized magnesium is **not recommended for routine use** [^d1acfc98] but may be considered in children ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbations within the first hour [^86d5b40c] [^abe3d030]. Monitor for hypotension, flushing, and bradycardia during infusion [^cf9d9848]; repeat dosing is not routine unless specialist-directed.

---

## Indications for magnesium sulfate administration

Magnesium sulfate is **indicated as adjunctive therapy** for acute asthma exacerbations, particularly in severe cases that do not respond to initial bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy [^068ca0f3]. The following clinical scenarios warrant consideration of magnesium sulfate administration:

- **Severe exacerbations**: Patients exhibiting severe symptoms such as marked dyspnea, accessory muscle use, altered consciousness, or oxygen saturation below 90% [^f395630a].

- **Refractory cases**: Patients who fail to respond adequately to initial bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy within the first hour of treatment [^068ca0f3].

- **Life-threatening asthma**: Patients with impending respiratory failure, altered mental status, or severe hypoxemia [^f6e516ca].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration protocol

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate

Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the **preferred route of administration** for acute asthma exacerbations. The following dosing protocols are recommended:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Administration protocol** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults | 2 g IV | Administer over 20 minutes [^068ca0f3] [^eef2ec2a] |
| Children | 40–50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) | Administer over 20–60 minutes [^86d5b40c] [^94478874] |

---

### Nebulized magnesium sulfate

Nebulized magnesium sulfate is **not routinely recommended** [^d1acfc98] but may be considered in specific pediatric cases. The following protocol is suggested for children aged 2 years and older with severe exacerbations:

- **Dose**: 150 mg isotonic magnesium sulfate solution.

- **Frequency**: Administer three doses within the first hour of treatment [^e1a09c47].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Administer alongside standard bronchodilator therapy (salbutamol and ipratropium bromide) [^e1a09c47].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting magnesium sulfate use

Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the **efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate** in acute asthma:

- **Reduced hospital admissions**: Intravenous magnesium sulfate significantly reduces hospital admission rates in adults and children with severe asthma exacerbations [^ded677d5] [^94478874].

- **Improved lung function**: Magnesium sulfate administration results in modest improvements in pulmonary function tests, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) [^ded677d5] [^665e501b].

- **Safety profile**: Magnesium sulfate is generally well-tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as flushing, fatigue, and mild hypotension [^ded677d5] [^cf9d9848].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

During magnesium sulfate administration, **clinicians should monitor** the following parameters:

- **Vital signs**: Regularly monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate [^cf9d9848].

- **Adverse effects**: Watch for signs of hypotension, flushing, bradycardia, and respiratory depression [^cf9d9848].

- **Renal function**: Assess renal function, particularly in patients with impaired kidney function, as magnesium is primarily excreted renally.

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Magnesium sulfate administration should be avoided or used with caution in the following scenarios:

- **Renal impairment**: Patients with significant renal dysfunction may experience magnesium accumulation and toxicity.

- **Cardiac conduction disorders**: Magnesium sulfate can affect cardiac conduction and should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities.

- **Hypotension**: Patients with pre-existing hypotension or hemodynamic instability may experience exacerbation of hypotension during magnesium infusion [^cf9d9848].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend intravenous magnesium sulfate as adjunctive therapy for severe asthma exacerbations that do not respond to initial bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy [^068ca0f3] [^f93be9ed]. Nebulized magnesium sulfate is **not routinely recommended** but may be considered in specific pediatric cases within the first hour of treatment [^d1acfc98] [^86d5b40c].

---

Magnesium sulfate is a **valuable adjunctive therapy** for acute asthma exacerbations, particularly in severe cases refractory to initial treatment. Intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function, while nebulized magnesium sulfate may be considered in specific pediatric cases. Clinicians should adhere to recommended dosing protocols, monitor patients closely for adverse effects, and consider contraindications before administration.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This overview does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about a specific intervention, magnesium sulfate.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 50 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 24 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 10 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was updated and one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for five PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two comparisons based on information about the effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulfate (iv) versus placebo and magnesium sulfate (nebulised) plus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) versus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) alone.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department [^ded677d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible. Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services. Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of IV MgSO4 in adults treated for acute asthma in the emergency department.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014. We also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults treated in the emergency department (ED) for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1. We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I(2) = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^d1acfc98]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life-threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO₄ has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSO₄ is less clear.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSO₄ administered in acute asthma.

Specific Aims

to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO₄ I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled β₂-agonist.

Search Methods

We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO₄ alone or in combination with β₂-agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co-intervention alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (43 references) of varying methodological quality were eligible; they included 2907 randomised patients (2777 patients completed). Nine of the 25 included studies involved adults; four included adult and paediatric patients; eight studies enrolled paediatric patients; and in the remaining four studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 25 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult. The quality of the evidence presented ranged from high to very low, with most outcomes graded as low or very low. This was largely due to concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies and imprecision in the pooled effect estimates. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropiumWe included seven studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent overall and the largest study reporting this outcome found no between-group difference at 60 minutes (MD -0.3% predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), 95% CI -2.71% to 2.11%). Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; participants = 1308; studies = 4; I² = 52%) but no difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU. Serious adverse events during admission were rare. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; participants = 1197; studies = 2). Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonistWe included 13 studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a conclusive benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Pooled results for hospital admission showed a point estimate that favoured the combination of MgSO₄ and β₂-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; I² = 0%). There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03; participants = 694; studies = 5). Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β₂-agonistWe included four studies in this comparison. The evidence for the efficacy of β₂-agonists in acute asthma is well-established and therefore this could be considered a historical comparison. Two studies reported a benefit of β₂-agonist over MgSO₄ alone for PEFR and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO₄ may result in modest additional benefits for lung function and hospital admission when added to inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSO₄ does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events. Individual studies suggest that those with more severe attacks and attacks of shorter duration may experience a greater benefit but further research into subgroups is warranted. Despite including 24 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. A core outcomes set for studies in acute asthma is needed. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where measuring lung function at the time of an exacerbation may not be possible. Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSO₄ has a role in acute asthma. However, the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fe6dbc93]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Protocol registration and reporting

The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022373692, available at). The review was done as per the methodology described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is being reported as per the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Research question

Does inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA, compared with standard therapy, help reduce asthma severity score in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation?

Information sources and eligibility criteria

We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception until 15 December 2023. The search was further updated on 15 February 2024. We did not use any language restrictions or filters during the database search. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search of the bibliography of relevant reports to identify additional citations. We also searched various registries (until 15 December 2023), namely ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry of India, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register. We included studies if they meet all the following criteria: (1) population: children aged 1–18 years with acute asthma, (2) intervention: inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4, (3) control: either placebo with standard therapy or standard therapy alone, (4) study design: parallel-group RCTs. Studies will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) population: adults, (2) intervention: oral or intravenous MgSO 4, (3) study design: non-RCT/crossover RCT, and studies published in non-English language or as abstract only.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the asthma severity. There are multiple scores for assessing asthma severity, namely the Pulmonary Index Score, Pediatric Asthma Severity Score, Childhood Asthma Scoreand the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All these scores are on an ordinal scale where increasing scores mean increasing disease severity. We combined studies reporting similar scores. If different scores were reported across studies, then we combined them using standardised mean difference (SMD) calculated by the following formula:

Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)), need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, effect on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and adverse events, including mortality before discharge.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: does route of administration make a difference? [^dfb6402e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the treatment of acute asthma is not clear. Four recent systematic reviews suggest a limited role of intravenous (i.v.) and inhaled nebulized treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature, focus on two recent large multicenter randomized controlled trials, and discuss future research directions.

Recent Findings

The Magnesium Nebulized Trial In Children (MAGNETIC) trial has shown little benefit to routine use of nebulized MgSO4 in children with acute asthma, but there may be a benefit in those with severe exacerbations and a shorter duration of symptoms. The 3Mg trial has shown no role for nebulized MgSO4 in adults and, at best a limited role for i.v. MgSO4 in only the most severe exacerbations. This is the only study with direct comparison of nebulized and i.v. MgSO4.

Summary

MgSO4 has a role in severe exacerbations of acute asthma and there is no evidence of benefit outside this clinical situation. Both nebulized and i.v. treatments are well tolerated and inexpensive. In adults, the most effective route of administration is i.v. There are no direct comparison studies in children. Further research should focus on more severe exacerbations.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating children with acute asthma in the emergency department [^94478874]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma in children can be life-threatening and must be treated promptly in the emergency setting. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended by various guidelines for cases of acute asthma that have not responded to first-line treatment with bronchodilators and steroids. The treatment has recently been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether it is equally effective for children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in children treated for acute asthma in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register up to 23 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children treated in the ED for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the search and independently extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted study authors in cases of missing data and other uncertainties relating to the studies. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean differences, both using fixed-effect models. We assessed each study for risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence for each outcome with GRADE and presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. There was insufficient evidence to conduct the planned subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Five studies (182 children) met the inclusion criteria, and four contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias, but our confidence in the evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small sample sizes. Treatment with IV MgSO4 reduced the odds of admission to hospital by 68% (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.74; children = 115; studies = 3; I(2) = 63%). This result was based on data from just three studies including 115 children. Meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes was extremely limited by paucity of data. We performed meta-analysis for the outcome 'return to the emergency department within 48 hours', which showed a very imprecise effect estimate that was not statistically significant (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.30; children = 85; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%). Side effects and adverse events were not consistently reported and meta-analysis was not possible, however few side effects or adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

IV MgSO4 may reduce the need for hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma, but the evidence is extremely limited by the number and size of studies. Few side effects of the treatment were reported, but the data were extremely limited.

### A randomized trial of magnesium in the emergency department treatment of children with asthma [^e4118639]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Magnesium sulfate has been shown to benefit asthmatic children and adults with poor responses to initial beta(2)-agonist therapy in the emergency department. We sought to determine whether the routine early administration of high-dose magnesium would benefit moderate to severely ill children with acute asthma.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 54 children 1 to 18 years of age who presented to the ED of a tertiary care children's hospital with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. After receiving a nebulized albuterol treatment (0.15 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg), patients were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate (maximum 2.5 g) or placebo. Thereafter, all patients were treated with frequent nebulized albuterol following a structured protocol. The main outcome was degree of improvement as assessed by Pulmonary Index scores over 120 minutes. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates and time required to meet discharge criteria.

Results

The mean change in Pulmonary Index score from baseline to 120 minutes was 2.83 for the magnesium group compared with 2.66 for the placebo group (95% confidence interval -1. 24 to 1.60). Eleven (46%) of 24 magnesium-treated patients were hospitalized compared with 16 (53%) of 30 in the placebo group (95% confidence interval -19% to 34%). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to time required to meet discharge criteria.

Conclusion

The routine administration of high-dose magnesium to moderate to severely ill children with asthma, as an adjunct to initial treatment with albuterol and corticosteroids, was not efficacious.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^6b9ea815]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known of the role of inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO(4) administered in acute asthma on pulmonary functions and admission rates.

Specific Aims

To quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO(4) i) in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist, ii) in comparison to inhaled β(2)-agonist alone or iii) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials in September 2012. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the grey literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO(4) alone or in combination with β(2)-agonist and/or ipratropium bromide and were compared with β(2)-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently by two review authors. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results are presented as standardised mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary function and risk ratios (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen trials (21 references) of unclear and high risk of bias were eligible and included 896 patients who were randomised (838 patients completed). Seven of the 16 included studies involved adults exclusively, three included adults and paediatric patients, four studies enrolled paediatric patients and in the remaining two studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 16 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult (see additional tables 1–3). The overall risk of bias among the included studies was variable and this is reflected in the 'Summary of findings' table with most outcomes being judged as only moderate or less. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonistThere was no statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function when inhaled MgSO(4) and β(2)-agonist was compared with β(2)-agonist alone (SMD 0.23; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.74; three studies, n = 188); however, there was considerable between study heterogeneity. There was no clear advantage in terms of hospital admissions (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.49, 1.16; four studies, n = 249), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β(2)-agonistThe results of pulmonary function in three studies that compared inhaled MgSO(4) versus β(2)-agonist were too heterogeneous to combine; however, two of the studies found poorer lung function on MgSO(4). There was no significant difference in terms of hospital admissions in a single small study when MgSO(4) was compared to β(2)-agonist (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.05, 5.31; one study, n = 33), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist and ipratropiumA further comparison has been included in the 2012 update of this review of MgSO(4) given in addition to inhaled ipratropium and β(2)-agonist therapy (as recommended by the GINA guidelines). However, there is not yet enough data for this outcome to come to any definite conclusions, but both small studies in adults with severe asthma exacerbation found improvements in pulmonary function with additional inhaled MgSO(4).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no good evidence that inhaled MgSO(4) can be used as a substitute for inhaled β(2)-agonists. When used in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonists (with or without inhaled ipratropium), there is currently no overall clear evidence of improved pulmonary function or reduced hospital admissions. However, individual study results from three trials suggest possible improved pulmonary function in those with severe asthma exacerbations (FEV1 less than 50% predicted). Heterogeneity among trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion. Further studies should focus on inhaled MgSO(4) in addition to the current guideline treatment for acute asthma (inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide). As the evidence suggests that the most effective role of nebulised MgSO(4) may be in those with severe acute features and this is where future research should be focused. A set of core outcomes needs to be agreed upon both in adult and paediatric studies to allow improved study comparison in future.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1821b574]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, GINA guidelines defined adults as those 6 years old and above. This dichotomy is not used in many of the available studies. Clearer details regarding trial methodology, particularly about sequence generation and allocation concealment would help future systematic reviewers appraise the literature more properly. Additionally, clear stratification by oral magnesium dose and duration of therapy can help produce more precise and useful estimates. Finally, none of the RCTs provided their research protocol.

The use of magnesium supplements as an adjuvant to standard asthma treatment in mild to moderate asthmatic patients is not supported by high quality evidence. Apart from one point at week 8 where the FEV1 had significantly improved, no other benefits from oral magnesium supplements were seen. Until future higher quality evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended for mild to moderate asthma.

### Intravenous magnesium for acute asthma? [^ade9012b]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1,500 people die from asthma. Standard treatment has been based on bronchodilators (e.g. beta 2-stimulants) and anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids). The recently revised British Guideline on the Management of Asthma suggests also using a single dose of i.v. magnesium sulphate in patients with acute severe asthma, an unlicensed indication. Here we discuss the rationale for giving i.v. magnesium and whether it offers any advantage for patients with acute severe asthma.

### Question 5: magnesium sulphate for acute asthma in children [^99e04c12]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Most children who present to the emergency department with acute asthma, respond well to inhaled β 2 -agonists (spacer or nebuliser), oxygen (if required) and systemic steroids. Guidelines across the world agree on this simple, straight forward evidenced based approach. In children with more severe asthma attacks and those who do not respond to initial treatment, the evidence base for the secondary level treatment is less clear. Many regimens exist for the next step. Intravenous Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO 4) is now used frequently in these situations and some centres are starting to use nebulized MgSO 4 as part of the initial maximal inhaled therapy options. This paper examines the role of MgSO 4 in acute asthma in children. It focusses on how MgSO 4 might work, what are the current recommendations for use and then what is the current evidence base to support its use. We have presented the evidence for the use of both nebulized and intravenous MgSO 4. At the end of the paper we have suggested future directions for research in this area. Our aim is to present a synthesis of the current role of MgSO 4 in the management of an acute asthma attack.

### IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute severe asthma: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^665e501b]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of IV magnesium sulfate as a treatment for acute asthma have had mixed results, with some data suggesting a benefit for acute severe asthma, but not for mild-to-moderate asthma. In a multicenter cohort, this study tests the hypothesis that administration of magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function in patients with acute severe asthma.

Design

Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Emergency departments (EDs) of eight hospitals.

Patients

Patients aged 18 to 60 years presenting with acute asthma and FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted on arrival to the ED.

Intervention

All patients received nebulized albuterol at regular intervals and IV methylprednisolone. Two grams of IV magnesium sulfate or placebo were administered 30 min after ED arrival. The primary efficacy end point was FEV1 at 240 min, and the data analysis was intent to treat.

Results

Two hundred forty-eight patients were included, and the mean FEV1 on ED arrival was 22.9% predicted. At 240 min, patients receiving magnesium had a mean FEV1 of 48.2% predicted, compared to 43.5% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 4.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 9.3%; p = 0.045). A regression model confirmed the effect of magnesium compared to placebo was greater in patients with a lower initial FEV1 (p < 0.05). If the initial FEV1 was < 25% predicted, the final FEV1 was 45.3% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 35.6% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 4.0 to 15.3%; p = 0.001). If the initial FEV was ≥ 25% predicted, magnesium administration was not beneficial; the final FEV1 was 51.1% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 53.9% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, - 2.9%, 95% CI, - 9.4 to 3.7; p = not significant). Overall, the use of magnesium sulfate did not improve hospital admission rates.

Conclusion

Administration of 2 g of IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function when used as an adjunct to standard therapy in patients with very severe, acute asthma.

### Optimizing the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma treatment in children [^25e3981b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease and currently affects 7.1 million children in the United States. Many children experience acute asthma exacerbations. Many children also require hospitalization despite treatment in an emergency department with current standard therapy (corticosteroids, albuterol, and ipratropium). These hospitalizations may be avoided if effective adjunctive therapies can be developed to adequately treat severe exacerbations.

Methods

Publications were searched in the PubMed database using the following keywords: magnesium AND asthma AND children AND randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 publications were returned. References of relevant articles were also screened. We included publications of controlled randomized trials where intravenous magnesium sulfate was studied in children (age < 18 years) with acute asthma (n = 7). We excluded studies in adults or trials with other formulations of magnesium (e.g., nebulized).

Results

Previous studies have demonstrated that intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO 4) significantly improves respiratory function and reduces hospitalization rate in children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Current dosing regimens involve a short infusion of 25-75mg/kg over 20min (maximum 2–2.5g/dose), though no studies have directly compared dosages for relative efficacy. Several studies suggest utilizing a peak plasma concentration of magnesium higher than 4mg/dL as a surrogate of efficacy. This review summarizes the literature regarding the use of IV MgSO 4 for the treatment of pediatric acute asthma.

Conclusions

We suggest that optimized dosing regimens could be developed using a linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation approach. We propose the factors that should be considered in future clinical trial design in order to better understand the use of IV MgSO 4 in pediatric acute asthma.

### Higher-dose intravenous magnesium therapy for children with moderate to severe acute asthma… [^c93658de]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

A comparison of percentage of improvement from baseline percent predicted PEFR in our lower- and higher-dose trials. P <.
001. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of a 40-mg/kg dose of intravenous magnesium sulfate for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. Study design. Double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting Two urban tertiary care pediatric emergency departments. Subjects Thirty patients, aged 6 to 17. 9 years, being treated for an acute asthma exacerbation. Intervention Eligible patients received either a magnesium sulfate infusion of 40 mg/kg or saline solution. Results. At 20 minutes, the time at which the infusion was completed, the magnesium group had a significantly greater percentage of absolute improvement from baseline in each of the following: predicted peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity. Conclusion Children treated with 40 mg/kg of intravenous magnesium sulfate for moderate to severe asthma showed remarkable improvement in short-term pulmonary function. The administration of β-agonist nebulizations in conjunction with corticosteroids is an effective treatment strategy, but corticosteroids require several hours before their effects are appreciated. 3–6 An efficient asthma adjunct is needed to help bridge the time to onset of corticosteroid therapy effects in the subpopulation of patients with asthma who are resistant to standard bronchodilating treatments. This ideal agent should be fast-acting, safe, and effective. It has been proposed that intravenous magnesium sulfate has all of these properties. The results of clinical studies using magnesium in adult asthmatic patients have been conflicting13-21 and few studies have been completed in children.

22, 23 We conducted the first controlled investigation of IVMg in childhood asthma, which demonstrated the considerable potential of IVMg treatment in the acute care setting. 23 In that randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients treated with 25 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate showed significant improvements compared with controls in short-term pulmonary function tests, beginning 30 minutes after the infusion was completed. The study also suggested that 1 of every 4 patients treated with IVMg could potentially avoid hospitalization. Other clinical situations, such as preeclampsia, warrant the use of higher doses of magnesium sulfate to obtain optimal effects without sacrificing safety. 24 A small case series of pediatric patients reported the beneficial effects of repeated 40- to 50-mg/kg doses of IVMg for patients with severe asthma. 22 No controlled studies to date have investigated this dose range in children.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of higher-dose IVMg therapy for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. Patients aged 6 to 17. 9 years, coming to the emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation, were evaluated for the study. The peak expiratory flow rate was measured in patients who required 3 nebulized bronchodilating treatments while in the emergency department. A PEFR less than 70% of the predicted value has been previously accepted as defining a moderate to severe exacerbation. 25 Informed consent was obtained and the patient was enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria consisted of a body temperature greater than 38. 5°C, the use of theophylline within the previous week, and a history of cardiac, renal, or pulmonary disease other than asthma.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in the acute and chronic management of asthma [^812e2c31]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute asthma is common and severe exacerbations may result in hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and, rarely, death. Standard emergency care includes systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, but additional treatments may be required in severe cases. We summarize the substantial evidence regarding the role of MgSO4 in acute asthma and comments on the potential benefit in chronic asthma.

Recent Findings

Inhaled and intravenous MgSO4 agents are used in the treatment of acute asthma, but only the intravenous formulation is effective. In severe asthma exacerbations, a single bolus dose of intravenous MgSO4 reduces admissions and improves pulmonary functions. Inhaled MgSO4 is more effective than placebo as a bronchodilator, but performs no better than salbutamol and there is no apparent synergy when the two are combined. Whereas intravenous MgSO4 treatments appear to be effective, long-term 'replacement' therapy with magnesium does not appear to affect chronic asthma.

Summary

Evidence suggests that intravenous MgSO4 is beneficial in acute asthma, while the evidence for inhaled MgSO4 is less convincing. Moreover, the role of replacement therapy with oral magnesium remains to be clarified. The use of intravenous MgSO4 remains uncommon, with emergency physicians appropriately restricting its use to patients with severe exacerbations.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7b144a3f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO 4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.

Results

10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO 4 /placebo and salbutamol (± ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%). Children in the MgSO 4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.

Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 in paediatric acute asthma management.

### Magnesium should be given to all children presenting to hospital with acute severe asthma [^d5066d83]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic condition affecting children worldwide and acute exacerbations requiring emergency medical management are common. In addition to corticosteroids, a number of drugs may be used in the management of acute severe asthma aiming to reverse bronchoconstriction. Magnesium sulphate - either inhaled or intravenous - may be added to conventional therapy of children with acute severe asthma. Despite its safety profile and effectiveness, the use of magnesium sulphate has been inconsistent due to lack of consensus. The authors believe that the accumulating evidence of a favorable 'cost benefit' profile justifies the use of magnesium for all children presenting with acute severe asthma.

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^c2af58bb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^68da73e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO4 has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO4.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO4 in the treatment asthma exacerbations.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the gray literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO4 alone or in combination with beta(2)-agonist and where compared to beta2-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results from fixed effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary functions and relative risks (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. Four studies compared nebulised MgSO4 with beta2-agonist to beta2-agonist and two studies compared MgSO4 to beta2-agonist alone. Three studies enrolled only adults and 2 enrolled exclusively pediatric patients; three of the studies enrolled severe asthmatics. Overall, there was a significant difference in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulised MgSO4 in addition to beta2-agonist (SMD: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.56; 4 studies); however, hospitalizations were similar between the groups (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.12; 3 studies). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in lung function improvement between adults and children, but were significantly different between severe and mild to moderate asthmatics (SMD: 0.69; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.25). Conclusions regarding treatment with nebulised MgSO4 alone are difficult to draw due to lack of studies in this area.

Authors' Conclusions

Nebulised inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to beta2-agonist in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation, appears to have benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and there is a trend towards benefit in hospital admission. The benefit is significantly greater in more severe asthma exacerbations. Heterogeneity between trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion.

### The effect of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma attacks: a randomized clinical trial [^063f61f5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Thirty percent of people with asthma do not respond to standard treatment, and complementary therapies are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of inhaled magnesium sulfate on the treatment response in emergency department (ED) patients with moderate to severe attacks of asthma.

Methods

This study is a randomized controlled trial, enrolling patients with moderate to severe asthma in the ED. Subjects allocated to the study group were treated with the standard, plus 3 mL of 260 mmol/L solution of magnesium sulfate every 20 to 60 minutes. The control group was treated with nebulized saline as a placebo in addition to standard protocol. The study results included admission rate and changes in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (primary outcomes) as well as dyspnea severity score, respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation.

Results

A total of 50 patients were enrolled (25 allocated to the study group and 25 to the control group). The study group as compared to the control group had significantly more improvement in the intensity of dyspnea, PEFR and Spo2 20, 40 and 60 minutes after intervention. In the control group, 11 patients (44%) required admission as compared to 18 (72%) in the control group (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Adding nebulized magnesium sulfate to standard therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma attacks leads to greater and faster improvement in PEFR, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. It also reduces hospitalization rates in this patient population.

### Asthma in adults [^8918bdb3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic, and for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 121 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: for acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus Ipratropium bromide, nebulisers, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting intravenous), corticosteroids (inhaled), corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, short courses), education about acute asthma, generalist care, helium-oxygen mixture, magnesium sulphate (intravenous, adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists), mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen, controlled 100% oxygen), specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled as needed for symptom relief), inhaled corticosteroids (low dose, increasing dose), leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids), theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

Magnesium — intravenous magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine use in asthma exacerbations; however, when given as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes, it reduces hospital admissions in some patients, including adults with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation and children whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care, and in adults and children who fail to respond to initial treatment and have persistent hypoxemia; trials excluding more severe asthma showed no benefit from adding intravenous or nebulized magnesium compared with placebo in routine care for adults and adolescents.

Magnesium sulfate — children with acute severe asthma: The role of magnesium sulfate is not established for children 5 years and younger; for children ≥ 2 years old with acute severe asthma, nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate may be considered as an adjuvant to standard treatment within the first hour, particularly when oxygen saturation is < 92% and symptoms last < 6 hours; intravenous magnesium sulfate in a single dose of 40–50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) by slow infusion (20–60 minutes) has also been used.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a15efe7f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO 4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.

Results

10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO 4 /placebo and salbutamol (± ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: -0.09; 95%CI: -0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%). Children in the MgSO 4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95%CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.

Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 in paediatric acute asthma management.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^09285550]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

We retrieved 499 records (394 from database searching and 105 from registers), of which 237 were duplicates (figure 1). We assessed 197 reports for full text, of which only 10 met all inclusion criteria and were included. A detailed list of excluded studies is provided in online supplemental table 2. The foremost reasons for exclusion were review articles, different interventions (intravenous or oral MgSO 4) or different populations (adults or children with other diseases).

Figure 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.

Study characteristics

We include 10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children of 2–17 years age range with acute asthma exacerbation. All trials used nebulised MgSO 4 along with SABA (± ipratropium bromide). All were done in the emergency room setting except one, which was done in the paediatric ICU. There was wide variation in the frequency and cumulative dose of the intervention (online supplemental table 3).

Risk of bias

We used the RoB2 tool for the risk of bias assessment. Three trials were at low risk of bias in all domains, and six trialshave some concerns in the selection of reported results (mostly due to lack of availability of protocol in the public domain and/or inadequate information on analysis reporting). One trial had concerns about the allocation concealment and the selection of reported results. None of the trials were considered at high risk of bias. Detailed graphical light plots and summary plots are shown in figure 2.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was asthma control, assessed by a Composite Asthma Severity Score and reported in six trials. There was no significant difference in the Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; SMD: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%) (figure 3A and table 1). Individual trials used different asthma severity scores, so we also compared them. The two groups had no significant difference regarding individual scores (figure 3B).

### Nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma [^79c8283b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed (all to October 2005) were searched using the key words magnesium, magnesium sulfate, magnesium compounds, nebulise, nebulize, vaporise, vaporize, nebulizers and vaporizers, aerosols, asthma, exacerbation, bronchial spasm, and bronchospasm.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy and safety endpoints of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma were included. All studies were evaluated independently by both authors. Efficacy outcomes included pulmonary function, clinical disease severity (as defined by each study), and rate of hospitalization. Safety outcomes were as described by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Six prospective trials met the study criteria. Nebulized magnesium alone failed to demonstrate any benefit compared with beta(2)-agonists alone at improving pulmonary function. In trials in which nebulized magnesium was used as a vehicle for albuterol, there appear to be additional benefits to albuterol therapy in terms of improvements in pulmonary function in a population with mild-to-moderate asthma. The heterogeneous patient populations, study designs, magnesium doses, and the delivery methods preclude the extrapolation of these results to current clinical practice.

Conclusions

The studies included in this review fail to clarify the role of nebulized magnesium sulfate; therefore, this therapy cannot be recommended at this time. Future studies evaluating the role of nebulized magnesium as an adjunct therapy to beta(2)-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy are necessary to determine whether a clinically relevant benefit of this intervention exists.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7061f270]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium (as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes in adult and pediatric patients not responding to initial treatment and having persistent hypoxemia, and in pediatric patients whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care), to reduce hospital admissions, including in adult patients with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^6cc35765]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### High-dose magnesium sulfate infusion protocol for status asthmaticus: a safety and pharmacokinetics cohort study [^e0656b8a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of high-dose magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) infusion in pediatric patients with status asthmaticus.

Methods

A prospective cohort study within a 20-bed pediatric intensive care unit in an academic community hospital. Patients 2–18 years of age admitted with status asthmaticus between 10/2009 and 8/2010 were included in the study. All patients received standard therapy for asthma, while the treatment group received an intravenous magnesium sulfate bolus of 50–75 mg/kg (0.2–0.3 mmol/kg) followed by 40 mg/kg/h (0.16 mmol/kg/h) for 4 h. Patients were monitored for cardiorespiratory complications. The treatment group underwent four blood draws to assess pharmacokinetic parameters.

Results

Nineteen patients were in the treatment group and 38 patients in the control group after exclusion criteria and consenting were completed. No clinically significant differences were found between groups. There were no interventions or discontinuations of MgSO(4) due to adverse events. In the treatment group, three patients had mild infusion-related reactions. Heart rate and respiratory rate were statistically significantly lower in the magnesium treatment group.

Conclusions

The continuous infusions of MgSO(4) were safe at the studied doses and maintained serum magnesium (SrMg) and ionized magnesium levels similar to levels required to produce smooth muscle relaxation in other clinical settings. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of high-dose continuous MgSO(4) infusion as an adjunctive treatment for severe asthma treatment and determine the SrMg level required to maintain airway smooth muscle relaxation.

### Magnesium sulfate in the treatment of severe asthma… [^051a1b78]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Each year in the United States, acute asthma attacks account for approximately 1. 8 million visits to emergency departments. Approximately 500, 000 patients are hospitalized each year with the diagnosis of asthma. The mainstay of current therapy for patients with acute asthma is beta agonists and systemic steroids. Beta agonists provide an immediate response, while systemic steroids take several hours to improve pulmonary function. Recent studies have found that intravenous magnesium sulfate may be an effective and safe adjuvant in the treatment of acute asthma attacks. Some studies have shown that intravenous magnesium sulfate may benefit patients with severe asthma but not those with mild to moderate asthma. Silverman and associates studied the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with severe acute asthma.

The trial was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial undertaken in the emergency departments of eight hospitals. Patients who presented to these emergency departments with acute asthma were included if they were between 18 and 60 years of age and had a forced expiratory volume in one second that was no more than 30 percent predicted. All patients received nebulized albuterol at regular intervals and intravenous methylprednisolone. Thirty minutes after arrival in the emergency department, the patients were randomized to receive 2 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo. The main outcome measure was theFEV 1 at 240 minutes. Intent to treat was also analyzed at 240 minutes. There were 248 patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study. The mean FEV 1 on arrival at the emergency department was 23 percent predicted.

At 240 minutes, patients who received intravenous magnesium sulfate had a significant improvement in FEV 1 compared with the placebo group. The effectiveness of the intravenous magnesium was greater in patients with a lower FEV 1 on admission to the emergency department. If the initial FEV 1 was less than 25 percent predicted, there was a substantial improvement of FEV 1 in patients treated with magnesium. The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate did not affect the hospital admission rate. The authors conclude that intravenous magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function when used as an adjuvant to asthma therapy in patients with severe acute asthma. They believe that the use of magnesium should be considered in the treatment of acutely ill patients with severe airway obstruction.

### Magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma: evaluation of current practice in adult emergency departments [^4c82e17a]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A recent meta-analysis showed that intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate have similar levels of evidence to support their use in the treatment of acute asthma in adults. This consisted of weak evidence of effect on respiratory function and hospital admissions, with wide confidence intervals ranging from no effect to significant positive effects. Current BTS/SIGN guidelines suggest an equivocal role for intravenous magnesium sulphate and no role for nebulised magnesium sulphate. A study was performed to assess what emergency physicians currently do in their management of acute asthma.

Method

A postal survey was undertaken of all adult emergency departments within the UK. A structured questionnaire was sent to all clinical leads in emergency medicine about their current usage of both intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma.

Results

180 of the 251 emergency departments in the UK responded (72%). Magnesium sulphate was used in 93%, mostly because it was expected to relieve breathlessness (70%) or reduce HDU/ITU admissions (51%). It was predominantly given to those patients with acute severe asthma (84%) and life-threatening exacerbations (87%), with most stating they would give the drug if there was no response to repeated nebulisers (68%). In comparison, nebulised magnesium sulphate was only used in two emergency departments (1%). The main reason for not administering the drug via a nebuliser was insufficient evidence (51%).

Conclusions

Intravenous magnesium sulphate is widely used for acute asthma, usually for patients with severe or life-threatening asthma who have not responded to initial treatment. Nebulised magnesium sulphate, by contrast, is hardly used at all. The use of intravenous magnesium sulphate is more extensive than current guidelines or available evidence would appear to support.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d1078aa3]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA (± ipratropium) compared with standard therapy does not lead to better control of asthma exacerbation or reduce the need for hospitalisation among the children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. It significantly improves pulmonary functions (PEFR) and is not associated with increased adverse events. However, our confidence in the evidence is low, and substantial uncertainty remains. There is a need for large RCTs on this aspect to improve the certainty of the evidence.

### Intravenous magnesium: prompt use for asthma in children treated in the emergency department (IMPACT-ED), a pilot randomized trial [^97cdcf94]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This pilot trial demonstrates that in a multi‐center randomized trial of early Intravenous magnesium sulfate in children with severe acute asthma, study drug can be delivered early in the ED course, measures of safety can be feasibly monitored during clinical care, and multiple blood samples can be obtained. Any future trial will require (1) flexibility to reach enrollment goals despite changing volumes of eligible participants, (2) refined trial procedures that are feasible for clinical providers in the environment of the ED, and (3) optimized processes to deliver study drug early enough to affect patient outcomes.

### A meta-analysis on intravenous magnesium sulphate for treating acute asthma [^b0ab2572]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthmatic attacks in children by meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify controlled clinical trials of magnesium sulphate in paediatric acute asthma which evaluated outcomes of hospitalisation or short term pulmonary function tests or symptom scores. Unpublished data were searched by personal contacts with authors and specialists. Two reviewers independently assessed trial qualities and synthesised data. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test. Outcome data were pooled by random or fixed effect models depending on presence or absence of heterogeneity.

Results

Five randomised placebo controlled trials involving a total of 182 patients were identified. They compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo in treating paediatric patients with moderate to severe asthmatic attacks in the emergency department, with co-therapies of inhaled beta2 agonists and systemic steroids. The studies were of high quality with results judged to be valid. Four studies showed that magnesium sulphate was effective, while one study found it ineffective. There was no significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of hospitalisation. In the fixed effect model, magnesium sulphate is effective in preventing hospitalisation (OR 0.290, 95% CI 0.143 to 0.589). The number needed to treat is 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Secondary outcomes of short term pulmonary function tests and clinical symptom scores also showed significant improvement.

Conclusion

Intravenous magnesium sulphate probably provides additional benefit in moderate to severe acute asthma in children treated with bronchodilators and steroids.

### Nebulized magnesium for moderate and severe pediatric asthma: a randomized trial [^39d655cb]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium sulfate, a rescue therapy added to bronchodilator and systemic steroid therapy for moderate and severe asthma, is uncommonly administered. We hypothesized that nebulized magnesium would confer benefit without undue risk.

Design and Methods

Patients aged 2 to 14 y with moderate and severe asthma (PRAM severity score ≥ 4) admitted to infirmary/observation unit care were randomized double-blind on admission to receive 800 mg nebulized magnesium or normal saline placebo after all received intensive therapy with combined nebulized albuterol-ipratropium and intravenous methylprednisolone. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary outcome; sample size was chosen to detect a 15% absolute improvement. Improvement over time in PRAM severity score and other secondary outcomes were compared for the overall group and severe asthma subset.

Results

One hundred and ninety-one magnesium sulfates and 174 placebo patients met criteria for analysis. The groups were similar with mean baseline PRAM scores > 7. Blinded active therapy significantly increased blood magnesium level 2 hr post-treatment completion compared to placebo, 0.85 vs 0.82 mmol/L, P = 0.001. There were no important adverse effects. Accelerated failure time analysis showed a non-significantly shortened time to medical readiness for discharge of 14% favoring the magnesium sulfate group, OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.40, P = 0.20. Mean times until readiness for discharge were 14.7 hr [SD 9.7] versus 15.6 hr [SD 11.3] for the investigational and placebo groups, respectively, P = 0.41.

Conclusions

Adding nebulized magnesium to combined nebulized bronchodilator and systemic steroid therapy failed to significantly shorten time to discharge of pediatric patients with moderate or severe asthma.

### A randomized clinical trial of nebulized magnesium sulfate in addition to albuterol in the treatment of acute mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations in adults [^81bee302]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) plus albuterol with that of albuterol alone in adult patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive nebulized MgSO(4) (384 mg in 6 mL of sterile water) or an equal volume of placebo (normal saline solution) in a double-blind fashion after each dose of nebulized albuterol administered (2.5 mg/3 mL) every 20 minutes for the first hour of the study. Spirometry was performed at baseline and every 20 minutes for 2 hours. Monitoring for safety included vital signs, pulse oximetry, and serum magnesium levels. Improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second was chosen as a primary efficacy end point.

Results

Among 74 patients enrolled, 37 were randomized to each of 2 study groups. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the 2 study groups in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second at any point during the trial or overall. There were no significant differences in vital signs, pulse oximetry, or serum magnesium levels at any point during the study.

Conclusion

The combination of nebulized MgSO(4) and albuterol provides no benefit in addition to that provided by therapy with albuterol in adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations. The efficacy of nebulized MgSO(4) in patients with severe asthma exacerbations remains unknown.

### Use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in addition to standard first-line treatment with inhaled / nebulised short-acting beta 2 agonist and systemic steroids in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in children: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^07c1d41b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of intravenous magnesium sulfate in asthma exacerbation is unclear.

Aims

To determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in managing asthma exacerbation in children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science up to May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials and followed the international guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Outcomes included morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, lung functions, adverse events, and mortality.

Results

Nine studies (total participants = 473) were included. Hospitalisation rate and the need for non-invasive ventilation were less among the intravenous magnesium sulfate group (mean difference (MD) = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90, I 2 7%, n = 115) and (risk ratio (RR) = 0.17, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.54, p = 0.003, n = 143), respectively. Asthma severity scores (MD = -0.18, 95%CI -1.35 to 0.98, I 2 2%, n = 115), length of hospital stay (MD = -78.86, 95%CI -200.37 to 42.66, I 2 99%, n = 284) and the need for invasive ventilation (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.17, I 2 0%, n = 237) were similar. There was no difference in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission rate (p = 0.43 n = 61). Peak expiratory flow improved in the intravenous magnesium group (p < 0.001, n = 20). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

We found low-certainty evidence that intravenous magnesium sulfate results in a lower hospitalisation rate and less need for non-invasive ventilation. Asthma scores, PICU admission, invasive ventilation and length of hospital stay were similar. While the evidence base is weak, the favourable safety profile suggests that intravenous magnesium sulfate can be considered a treatment for asthma exacerbations.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a502b3a5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using standard Cochrane methodology and is reported as per appropriate guidelines. All studies used a placebo and were double-blind, adding to their robustness. Most studies enrolled children with similar disease severity (moderate to severe exacerbation) from similar settings (emergency room), reducing the clinical heterogeneity and making the results more robust and widely applicable. However, there are certain limitations. Most of the studies had small sample sizes, hence, had wide CIs, reducing the level of certainty. The asthma severity scores used in different studies varied greatly. Though we used an appropriate approach to summarise them, it still affects our certainty in results. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data for subgroup analyses based on disease severity or age group. Though adverse events were rare, they were not reported consistently.

Due to these limitations, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes was low or very low. This certainty can be improved by adding larger, adequately powered, placebo-controlled multicentric RCTs. Until larger trials are available, the current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on therapy in children presenting with acute exacerbation of asthma not responding to inhaled SABAs and systemic steroids.

### High-dose magnesium sulfate infusion for severe asthma in the emergency department: efficacy study [^abb55a64]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of a high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion in patients with severe, noninfectious-mediated asthma.

Design

Prospective, randomized, open-label study.

Setting

Twenty-nine-bed pediatric emergency department located in a children's hospital in Asuncion, Paraguay.

Patients

All patients of 6–16 years old who failed to improve after 2 hours of standard therapy for asthma.

Interventions

Subjects were randomized to receive magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg over 1 hour (bolus) or high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion of 50 mg/kg/hr for 4 hours (max, 8.000 mg/4 hr). Patients were monitored for cardiorespiratory complications.

Measurements and Main Results

Asthma severity was assessed via asthma scores and peak expiratory flow rates at 0-2-6 hours. The primary outcome was discharge to home at 24 hours. An analysis of the hospital length of stay and costs was a secondary outcome. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled, 19 in each group. The groups were of similar ages, past medical history of asthma, asthma score, and peak expiratory flow rate. There was a significant difference in the patients discharged at 24 hours: 47% in high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion (9/19) versus 10% (2/21) in the bolus group (p = 0.032) with an absolute risk reduction 37% (95% CI, 10–63) and a number needed to treat of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.6–9.5) to facilitate a discharge at or before 24 hours. The length of stay was shorter in the high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion group (mean ± SD in hr: high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion, 34.13 ± 19.54; bolus, 48.05 ± 18.72; p = 0.013; 95% CI, 1.3–26.5). The cost per patient in the high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion group was one third lower than the bolus group (mean ± SD: high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion, $603.16 ± 338.47; bolus, $834.37 ± 306.73; p < 0.016). There were no interventions or discontinuations of magnesium sulfate due to adverse events.

Conclusions

The early utilization of high-dose prolonged magnesium sulfate infusion (50 mg/kg/hr/4 hr), for non-infectious mediated asthma, expedites discharges from the emergency department with significant reduction in healthcare cost.

### Early versus delayed administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate for pediatric asthma [^285c706d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to describe and examine the factors associated with the early administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV Mg) in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) for an asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of children aged 5–11 years who received IV Mg in the pediatric ED between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019 for management of an asthma exacerbation. Primary outcome was administration of IV Mg in ≤ 60 min from ED triage ('early administration'). Comparison of clinical management and therapies in children who received early versus delayed IV Mg and the factors associated with early administration of IV Mg were examined.

Results

Early (n = 90; 31.6%) IV Mg was associated with more timely bronchodilators (47 versus 68 min; p ≤ 0.001) and systemic corticosteroids (36 versus 46.5 min; p ≤ 0.001). There was no difference between the two cohorts in returns to the ED within 72 h (1.1% versus 2.1%; p = .99) or readmissions within 1 week one week (2.2% versus 0.5%; p = .2). Hypoxia (aOR = 3.76; 95% CI = 2.02–7.1), respiratory rate (aOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.02–1.07), retractions (aOR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.25–3.94), and prior hospital use for asthma-related complaints (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.16–3.84) were significantly associated with early IV Mg.

Conclusions

Early administration of IV Mg was associated with more timely delivery of first-line asthma therapies, was safe, and improved ED throughput without increasing return ED visits or hospitalizations for asthma.

### Intravenous magnesium sulphate provides no additive benefit to standard management in acute asthma [^2e0e49b2]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) is known to have a bronchodilator effect on smooth muscle but studies have shown conflicting results on its efficacy in acute asthma, although its use is recommended in national and international guidelines.

Aims

To determine if intravenous MgSO(4), when used as an adjunct to standard therapy, improves the outcome in acute asthma.

Methods

A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial comparing 1.2g MgSO(4) with standard therapy in adult patients with acute asthma. Patients had a PEF ≤ 75% predicted and all were treated with oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, and IV hydrocortisone. They then received 1.2g IV MgSO(4) or placebo. Outcome measures were % predicted PEF at 60 min and hospital admission rates.

Results

One hundred and twenty nine patients were studied. Placebo and active treatment groups were well matched at baseline. MgSO(4) had no benefit with regards hospital admission rates or % predicted PEF at 60 min (p = 0.48) for the whole group, or for subgroups of life-threatening (p = 0.85), severe (p = 0.63) and moderate (p = 0.67) acute asthma.

Conclusion

This study did not show additional benefit from 1.2g IV MgSO(4) when given as an adjunct to standard therapy for acute asthma.

### Intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate versus standard therapy for severe acute asthma (3Mg trial): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^ddf20e5a]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggested intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) might improve respiratory function in patients with acute asthma. We aimed to determine whether intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) improve symptoms of breathlessness and reduce the need for hospital admission in adults with severe acute asthma.

Methods

In our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 16 years) with severe acute asthma at emergency departments of 34 hospitals in the UK. We excluded patients with life-threatening features or contraindication to study drugs. We used a central randomisation system to allocate participants to intravenous MgSO(4) (2 g in 20 min) or nebulised MgSO(4) (three 500 mg doses in 1 h) alongside standard therapy including salbutamol, or placebo control plus standard therapy alone. We assessed two primary outcome measures in all eligible participants who started treatment, according to assigned treatment group: the proportion of patients admitted to hospital within 7 days and breathlessness measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in the 2 h after initiation of treatment. We adjusted for multiple testing using Simes's method. The trial stopped before recruitment was completed because funding expired. This study is registered, number ISRCTN04417063.

Findings

Between July 30, 2008, and June 30, 2012, we recruited 1109 (92%) of 1200 patients proposed by the power calculation. 261 (79%) of 332 patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4) were admitted to hospital before 7 days, as were 285 (72%) of 394 patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4) and 281 (78%) of 358 controls. Breathlessness was assessed in 296 (89%) patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4), 357 (91%) patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4), and 323 (90%) controls. Rates of hospital admission did not differ between patients treated with either form of MgSO(4) compared with controls or between those treated with nebulised MgSO(4) and intravenous MgSO(4). Change in VAS breathlessness did not differ between active treatments and control, but change in VAS was greater for patients in the intravenous MgSO(4) group than it was in the nebulised MgSO(4) group (5·1 mm, 0·8 to 9·4; p = 0·019). Intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) did not significantly decrease rates of hospital admission and breathlessness compared with placebo: intravenous MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·04; p = 0·083) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of 2·6 mm (-1·6 to 6·8; p = 0·231) compared with placebo; nebulised MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0·96 (0·65 to 1·40; p = 0·819) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of -2·6 mm (-7·0 to 1·8; p = 0·253) compared with placebo.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest nebulised MgSO(4) has no role in the management of severe acute asthma in adults and at best suggest only a limited role for intravenous MgSO(4) in this setting.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^e71977fa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Population

We conducted a post hoc secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of children aged 2 to 17 years treated at 7 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada EDs for acute asthma from September 26, 2011, to November 19, 2019 (the trial protocol for the RCT is given in Supplement 1). This secondary analysis was performed from September to November 2020. The research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and of all participating sites approved the RCT and all data obtained during the study. Waiver of informed consent was not obtained for this secondary analysis because the parent trial included collection of all data used in this secondary analysis, and the consent form specified intravenous magnesium as a possible required treatment during trial participation. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Children enrolled in the RCT who continued to experience moderate to severe respiratory distress, defined by a PRAM score of 5 points or higher(Table 1)after 1 hour of standardized initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids and 3 treatments with inhaled albuterol and ipratropium bromide, were randomly assigned to receive three 20-minute treatments of nebulized albuterol (5 mg) plus either nebulized magnesium sulfate (600 mg) or 5.5% saline placebo via a pretested, high-efficiency Aeroneb Go nebulizer (Philips). After completion of this therapy (60 minutes after randomization), the ED physicians prescribed additional treatments such as IV magnesium sulfate as needed and decided whether to hospitalize patients according to their clinical judgement.

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

The RCT included children with a physician's diagnosis of asthma or a previous wheeze treated with inhaled bronchodilators or systemic corticosteroids. Children with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, neurologic disease, or other systemic diseases were excluded, as were those experiencing their first episode of asthmalike symptoms who may have had other diagnoses. Children needing immediate airway stabilization and those who received IV magnesium therapy before trial enrollment were also excluded.

Exposure

This secondary analysis used data from patients enrolled in the RCT who were administered IV magnesium after receipt of nebulized magnesium or placebo before disposition from the ED based on the clinical judgment of the treating ED physician. Magnesium was given by a continuous 30-minute IV infusion using magnesium doses of 40 to 75 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) in accordance with the local standard of care.

### Survey of physicians' attitudes toward the use of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations in Turkey [^1a58b4e9]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is considered to be a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective medication for severe asthma exacerbations. We surveyed physicians who treat patients with asthma to evaluate the current knowledge and usage of MgSO4.

Methods

A self-administered questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and was distributed to participants of its annual congress.

Results

Of the 456 respondents (mean age: 36.53 ± 9.11 years), 42.3% reported to use MgSO4 in asthma exacerbations in their practice, and 48.7% agreed that MgSO4 was included in asthma guidelines. The best known indication was that it was useful only in patients refractory to bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids (67.7%). The two most common reasons to use MgSO4 were to shorten hospital stay (94.7%), and prevent admission to intensive care unit (80.3%). The respondents mostly used MgSO4 in the treatment of severe or life-threatening exacerbations. Thirty-nine percent believed that MgSO4 had no effect on discharge period, and 29% of them marked minor side effects. The most common reason for not using MgSO4 was inexperience (36.5%). Having an academic affiliation (OR = 3.20, p < 0.001), the number of asthmatic outpatients seen per month (OR = 1.82, p = 0.007), and more recent graduation from medical school (≤ 1991) (OR = 0.23, p < 0.001) were associated with the use of MgSO4 in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

Even though the effect of MgSO4 in acute severe asthma is well known, only half of the physicians dealing with asthma patients have used it in their practice. Education and encouragement in this regard are necessary.

### Intravenous magnesium: prompt use for asthma in children treated in the emergency department (IMPACT-ED), a pilot randomized trial [^00dd630c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To better understand the effect of IVMg on children with severe acute asthma and to plan for a larger multicenter trial that can adequately evaluate the effect of IVMg on patient outcomes including hospitalization, we conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled pilot trial of IVMg at three sites. The objectives of this pilot trial were to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling children in the ED with severe acute asthma in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of placebo, low‐dose IVMg, or high‐dose IVMg; (2) demonstrate the feasibility of timely delivery of study medication to enrolled patients and assessment of blood pressure and associated adverse effects (AEs) in a standardized protocol; and (3) obtain serial blood samples to externally validate a previously constructed pharmacokinetic (PK) modeland develop a combined PK/pharmacodynamic model for IVMg using magnesium (total and ionized) serum concentrations and their correlation with measures of efficacy (improvement in respiratory distress) and safety in children with severe acute asthma.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^6b2ef94e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8abaafd]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

A medical librarian (MVN) performed a comprehensive literature search on April 2016. Searched databases were as follows: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and on-going clinical trials. The main search concepts were asthma and oral magnesium; Boolean operators: OR (for combining synonyms), AND (to combine concepts), and truncations were used when appropriate. A review of references and a manual search of relevant articles was completed. Additionally, we contacted the authors of the trials to minimize chances of missed articles. The search was updated on May 2017. No restrictions to study type, time, or language were applied.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included RCTs that investigated the use of oral magnesium as an adjunct to asthma inhalers. Asthma was defined in accordance with the authors of the included trials, which were either clinically, objectively (spirometry), or both. All trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) Population: mild and moderate asthmatic older than 6 years [6 years was the cut-off based on the global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines];(2) Intervention: all preparations of oral magnesium, regardless of name or dosage; (3) Comparisons: placebo or no treatment; (4) Outcomes: frequency of rescue asthma exacerbation, ER visits or hospital admissions, objective measures: FEV1, FVC, and PEF, daytime symptoms, daytime activity, night-time symptoms, frequency of bronchodilator use, use of oral or inhaled steroids, side effects, and mortality; (5) Timing: treatment for any duration was included; (6) Study type: RCTs, blinded or open-labeled. Crossover trials were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (AA and FA) separately scanned the titles and abstracts of all articles, and when needed, the full text was retrieved and reviewed to identify all relevant articles. A third author (MF) resolved any disagreements.

Data extraction

Important data were extracted using a piloted form, which incorporated all attributes of the studies, including author, publication year, country, setting, design, sample size, intervention (dose and type), placebo, patient's age and sex, severity, study duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcomes, and limitations. Data was extracted by AA and FA and reviewed by MF. We contacted the author of the study in question for any missing information.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for bronchial hyperreactivity: a randomized, controlled, double-blind study [^5bc33827]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma. Conflicting data exist concerning the effect of magnesium on bronchial hyperreactivity.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on bronchial reactivity to metacholine in 30 subjects with bronchial hyperreactivity. Two days after baseline metacholine provocation, 20 subjects received 0.3 mmol/kg/h of intravenous magnesium sulfate and 10 subjects received normal saline solution. Metacholine provocation was repeated 30 minutes after the initiation of the magnesium or placebo infusion.

Results

The difference of the postinterventional minus the baseline provocative dose of metacholine required to decrease the forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 20% (PC20) was significantly higher in the magnesium group compared with the placebo group (0.48 ± 0.46 mg/mL versus 0.05 ± 0.73 mg/mL, P = 0.028). In the magnesium group, the PC(20) significantly increased (from 0.83 ± 0.54 mg/mL to 1.31 ± 0.66 mg/mL, P = 0.0001), whereas there was no change in the placebo group (0.86 ± 0.52 mg/mL to 0.91 ± 0.54 mg/mL, P = 0.83).

Conclusions

In the magnesium group, 30% of the subjects reached a normal PC(20) compared with 10% in the placebo group. We conclude that intravenous magnesium sulfate significantly improved bronchial hyperreactivity and may serve as an adjunct to standard treatment.

### Evidence-based treatments for acute asthma [^190ef8f6]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma is an important health care problem; over 12 million people in the United States suffer from asthma, the majority of whom are young patients. Presentations of acute asthma to emergency departments are common. In the United States, acute asthma presentations account for close to 2 million emergency department visits annually, and these patients often exhibit acute and chronic markers of severe asthma; so controlling asthma is important from many perspectives. We review the evidence for various acute asthma therapies, using the highest levels of evidence, employing systematic reviews (especially those from the Cochrane Collaboration) and evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide therapy decisions. beta agonists and systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstones of initial treatment. Delivery of beta agonists via nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler with spacer device appear to be similarly efficacious. However, recent evidence from studies involving children and adults indicate that addition of ipratropium bromide to early beta agonist treatments may reduce airway obstruction and reduce hospital admissions, especially for more severe asthma. Evidence from systematic reviews indicates that intravenous magnesium sulfate may provide similar benefits in severe asthma. Antibiotics, intravenous beta agonists, and intravenous aminophylline have been shown to add little and may increase adverse effects. Treatment for discharged patients should include systemic corticosteroids for 5–7 days, for all but the mildest asthma. Addition of inhaled corticosteroids should be considered for most patients, since evidence suggests that inhaled corticosteroids may reduce relapses and improve quality of life. Alternative treatments such as long-acting beta agonists and leukotriene antagonists remain unproven in this setting. Linking a discharge plan to close follow-up and asthma education (especially an action plan) needs to be encouraged. Acute asthma is a common problem and treatment has improved dramatically over the past 10 years. Employing the evidence-based practice outlined above should reduce the burden of acute asthma on patients and the health care system.

### Intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate for acute asthma: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d45fba80]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effect of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate upon hospital admissions and pulmonary function in adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and quasi-randomised trials of intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate in acute asthma. Trials were identified by searches of the electronic literature, relevant journal websites and conference proceedings, and contact with authors and experts. Data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis of the relative risk (RR) of hospital admission and the standardised mean difference (SMD) in pulmonary function.

Results

24 studies (15 intravenous, 9 nebulised) incorporating 1669 patients were included. Intravenous treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.51; p = 0.05), but no significant effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.08; p = 0.22), and in children with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD 1.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.08; p < 0.001) and hospital admission (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; p = 0.005). Nebulised treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.36; p = 0.09), and hospital admission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; p = 0.06), and in children with no significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.98; p = 0.69) or hospital admission (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.19 to 20.93; p = 0.56).

Conclusion

Intravenous magnesium sulphate appears to be an effective treatment in children. Further trials are needed of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in adults and nebulised magnesium sulphate in children.

### Magnesium sulphate in acute severe asthma in children (MAGNETIC): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^abe3d030]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Little evidence is available for the effect of nebulised magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) in acute asthma in children. We assessed the effect of MgSO(4) treatment in children with severe acute asthma.

Methods

In this randomised placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel trial, we enrolled children (aged 2–16 years) with severe acute asthma who did not respond to standard inhaled treatment from 30 hospitals in the UK. Children were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide with either 2·5 mL of isotonic MgSO(4) (250 mmol/L; 151 mg per dose; MgSO(4) group) or 2·5 mL of isotonic saline (placebo group) on three occasions at 20-min intervals. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated randomisation sequence, with random block sizes of two to four. Both patients and researchers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was the Yung Asthma Severity Score (ASS) at 60 min post-randomisation. We used a statistical significance level of p < 0·05 for a between-group difference, but regarded a between-group difference in ASS of 0·5 as the minimal clinically significant treatment effect. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN81456894.

Findings

Between Jan 3, 2009, and March 20, 2011, we recruited and randomly assigned 508 children to treatment: 252 to MgSO(4) and 256 to placebo. Mean ASS at 60 min was lower in the MgSO(4) group (4·72 [SD 1·37]) than it was in the placebo group (4·95 [SD 1·40]; adjusted difference -0·25, 95% CI -0·48 to -0·02; p = 0·03). This difference, however, was not clinically significant. The clinical effect was larger in children with more severe asthma exacerbation (p = 0·03) and those with symptoms present for less than 6 h (p = 0·049). We detected no difference in the occurrence of adverse events between groups.

Interpretation

Overall, nebulised isotonic MgSO(4), given as an adjuvant to standard treatment, did not show a clinically significant improvement in mean ASS in children with acute severe asthma. However, the greatest clinical response was seen in children with more severe attacks (SaO(2) < 92%) at presentation and those with preceding symptoms lasting less than 6 h.

### Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9858b0eb]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate on treating adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

Electronic literature search and the manual search of key respiratory journals were performed up to October 18, 2011. Randomized controlled trials were included if patients had been treated with intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate in combination with β2-agonists and were compared with the use of β2-agonists. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the relative risks (RRs) were calculated for pulmonary functions and hospital admission respectively.

Results

25 trials (16 intravenous, 9 nebulized) involving 1754 patients were included. In adults intravenous treatment was associated with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 to 0.55; p = 0.02) but weak evidence of effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.86,95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06) in adults, and in children with significant effects upon both respiratory function (SMD, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 3.08; p = 0.0008) and hospital admission (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; p = 0.008). Nebulized treatment was associated with significant effects upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; p = 0.009) and hospital admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; p = 0.02) in adults.

Conclusion

The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate, in addition to β2-agonists and systemic steroids, in the treatment of acute asthma appears to produce benefits with respect to improve pulmonary function and reduce the number of hospital admissions for children, and only improve pulmonary function for adults. However, the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate just appears to produce benefits for adults.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5d6cd62d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

### Intravenous magnesium in asthma pharmacotherapy: variability in use in the PECARN registry [^6198067b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the use, efficacy, and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IVMg) in children with asthma whose emergency department (ED) management is recorded in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry.

Study Design

This multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from 7 EDs from 2012 to 2017. We described use of IVMg in children aged 2–17 years treated for acute asthma and its effect on blood pressure. We also used multivariable analysis to examine factors associated with use of IVMg and its association with return visits within 72 hours.

Results

Across 61854 asthma visits for children, clinicians administered IVMg in 6497 (10.5%). Median time from triage to IVMg administration was 154 minutes (IQR 84, 244). During 22495 ED visits resulting in hospitalization after ED treatment, IVMg was administered in 5774 (25.7%) (range by site 15.9%, 50.6%). Patients were discharged home from the ED after 11.1% of IVMg administrations, and hypotension occurred after 6.8%. Variation in IVMg use was not explained by patient characteristics. Revisits did not differ between patients discharged after IVMg and those not receiving IVMg.

Conclusions

In PECARN Registry EDs, administration of IVMg occurs late in ED treatment, for a minority of the children likely to benefit, with variation between sites, which suggests the current clinical role for IVMg in preventing hospitalization is limited. Discharge after IVMg administration is likely safe. Further research should prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of early IVMg administration.

### Aerosolized magnesium sulfate for acute asthma: a systematic review [^d23ead57]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of MgSO(4) is one of numerous treatment options available during exacerbations of asthma. While the efficacy of therapy with IV MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the effect of inhaled MgSO(4) in the treatment of patients with asthma exacerbations in the emergency department.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion and were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register, which consists of a combined search of the EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases and the manual searching of 20 key respiratory journals. Reference lists of published studies were searched, and a review of the gray literature was also performed. Studies were included if patients had been treated with nebulized MgSO(4) alone or in combination with beta(2)-agonists and were compared to the use of beta(2)-agonists alone or with an inactive control substance. Trial selection, data extraction, and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. The results from fixed-effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary functions and the relative risks (RRs) for hospital admission. Both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. There was a non-significant increase in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) and those whose treatments did not (SMD, 0.22; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.47 five studies); there was also a trend toward reduced hospitalizations in patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.09; four studies). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that lung function improvement was similar in adult patients and in those patients who received nebulized MgSO(4) in addition to a beta(2)-agonist.

Conclusions

The use of nebulized MgSO(4), particularly in addition to a beta(2)-agonist, in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation appears to produce benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and may reduce the number of hospital admissions.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b6592300]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 22 million children worldwide. Acute exacerbation is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children with asthma and accounts for almost 13 000 deaths and 5 million disability-adjusted life years, along with a huge healthcare cost. The first-line therapy for acute exacerbation of childhood asthma is well established and comprises systemic corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) along with controlled oxygen. However, many children do not respond to these agents and hence necessitate additional therapy (second line). The role of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) has been explored as second-line therapy for acute exacerbation; however, the controversy on its route and timing still exists.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2021 update suggests using intravenous MgSO 4 (not nebulised) for patients with severe exacerbation not responding to initial treatment; however, the 2023 update suggests nebulised isotonic MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy for children aged 2 years and above. In a recent systematic review, intravenous MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy was associated with reduced hospitalisation and improved lung functions. Previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 showed variable and contradictory results, adding further uncertainty. Recently, the role of nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in asthma exacerbation has been further explored in many more trials, necessitating an update on this aspect.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to update the evidence on the efficacy and safety of inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in children and adolescents (up to 18 years) with acute asthma exacerbation.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^69c8f1c4]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Recent GINA updates (2023) suggest against routine use of intravenous MgSO 4, but at the same time, advocate considering it in patients with severe asthma who do not respond to first-line treatment. Though robust data do not support this recommendation, one may argue that there are some potential beneficial effects on pulmonary functions and clinical outcomes, like hospitalisation, without any significant increase in adverse event rates. Hence, it may be justified until better therapies are available. However, the same guideline from GINA suggests considering nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjuvant to salbutamol and ipratropium in children aged > 2 years with severe exacerbation. The evidence does not support this recommendation well. The index systematic review did not observe any significant effect on critical clinical outcomes. The lack of efficacy was consistently seen across almost all studies included in the review, adding to the robustness of the results. Similar observations were reported in previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 in children. There was significant improvement (though of lesser magnitude) in PEFR with nebulised MgSO 4, as observed with intravenous MgSO 4 as well, but there was no significant change in FEV 1. However, unlike intravenous MgSO 4, it does not translate to improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that the 2023 GINA recommendations might not be in coherence with the updated review and need a revisit on this aspect.

### Comparison of nebulized magnesium sulfate plus albuterol to nebulized albuterol plus saline in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma [^853c28b0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A prospective, randomized, double blinded study was conducted to determine whether a combination of nebulized magnesium sulfate and albuterol as a single dose adds any benefit in management of children with mild to moderate asthma when compared to nebulized albuterol with saline. The difference in FEV1 was significant at 10 and 20 min after a single dose of the combined treatment with magnesium and albuterol when compared with the albuterol and saline group (1.41 L ± 0.53 vs. 1.13 L ± 0.34, respectively, p = 0.03). The addition of magnesium to albuterol seems to provide short-term benefits in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma.

### Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e65d236d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (IV) and nebulized magnesium sulfate in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of IV and nebulized magnesium sulfate in pediatric acute asthma were included. The outcomes subject to meta-analysis were pulmonary function, hospitalization, and further treatment. If statistical heterogeneity was significant, random-effects models were used for meta-analysis, otherwise, fixed-effects models were applied.

Results

Ten randomized and quasi-randomized trials (6 IV, 4 nebulized) were identified. Intravenous magnesium sulfate treatment is associated with significant effects on respiratory function (standardized mean difference, 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–3.08; P = 0.0008) and hospital admission (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31–0.95; P = 0.03). But nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment shows no significant effect on respiratory function (standardized mean difference, 0.19; 95% CI, -0.01–0.40; P = 0.07) or hospital admission (risk ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.86–1.44; P = 0.42).

Conclusions

The meta-analysis revealed that IV magnesium sulfate is an effective treatment in children, with the pulmonary function significantly improved and hospitalization and further treatment decreased. But nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment showed no significant effect on respiratory function or hospital admission and further treatment.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^be70d48d]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^a38887f4]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

IV magnesium — Recommendation 4 for children with critical asthma states: We suggest the use of IV magnesium (intermittent or continuous) as an adjunct therapy in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Evidence included 3 RCTs and 5 retrospective observational studies, with 4 studies conducted in the ED, 2 in a non-ICU ward, and 2 in PICU/hospital ward; Two RCTs demonstrated lower intubation rates with the use of IV magnesium, whereas 1 observational study showed no benefit of IV magnesium over placebo, and the use of NRS was lower in 1 RCT, higher in 1 observational study, and similar in 2 others. Background notes frequent utilization in pediatric asthma with advantages including ease of administration, low cost, wide availability, and a favorable safety profile, and its use has been described in the ED, hospital ward, and PICU settings.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^7d6ed751]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Medications

IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations among patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations in the ED, and it should be considered in patients not responding to initial therapies (Table 2).– The use of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic with bronchodilator effects, has been suggested in patients who are not intubated at low, subdissociative doses; however, quality data showing a clinical benefit are lacking. Some interest exists in using biologic agents in asthma exacerbations, given their relatively quick onset over days, although data have been limited to case reports and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating that benralizumab administered in the ED reduced the rate of recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 12 weeks. Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline and aminophylline) and terbutaline, an IV β 2 -agonist, are not recommended for asthma or COPD exacerbations among adults because of their lack of efficacy compared with inhaled β 2 -agonists, and methylxanthines are associated with increased side effects and adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias.

Inhaled Gases

The use of volatile anesthetics for life-threatening asthma exacerbations has been described in case reports, although prospective data are insufficient to support their use outside of refractory cases of bronchospasm until further research is carried out. – No role currently exists for volatile anesthetics in severe COPD exacerbations because studies show mixed effects on respiratory mechanics compared with IV sedation. Helium-oxygen (heliox) mixtures, used to promote laminar flow and to reduce airway resistance, may improve respiratory mechanics during severe asthma exacerbations, although data are limited on meaningful clinical outcomes in this population. – Among COPD exacerbations requiring NIV or IMV, heliox improves the work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Two RCTs of COPD exacerbations requiring NIV found that heliox did not prevent NIV failure; however, trends toward lower intubation rates and greater time to NIV failure were noted in the heliox group. – Heliox could be considered on a case-by-case basis as an adjunct therapy for patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations refractory to other treatments.

Data analysis

For the purposes of the primary study outcome, we considered the ITT population as the subset of eligible patients for whom informed consent was provided and who were randomized to one of the study's three treatment arms, using the randomized treatment arm for analysis. For the safety outcomes, the population was composed of all participants who received study medication using the study drug arm that was received, even if this differed from the treatment assignment. Participant characteristics and study results are reported using descriptive statistics. This study was designed to assess feasibility and was not powered to detect a difference in hospitalization between arms. Counts and percentages of all reported measures are summarized overall and by study arm.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^b1821c8e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Despite guidelines recommending administration of intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate for refractory pediatric asthma, the number of asthma-related hospitalizations has remained stable, and IV magnesium therapy is independently associated with hospitalization.

Objective

To examine the association between IV magnesium therapy administered in the emergency department (ED) and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma after adjustment for patient-level variables.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial of children with acute asthma treated from September 26, 2011, to November 19, 2019, at 7 Canadian tertiary care pediatric EDs was conducted between September and November 2020. In the randomized clinical trial, 816 otherwise healthy children aged 2 to 17 years with Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) scores of 5 points or higher after initial therapy with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled albuterol with ipratropium bromide were randomly assigned to 3 nebulized treatments of albuterol plus either magnesium sulfate or 5.5% saline placebo.

Exposures

Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy (40–75 mg/kg).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between IV magnesium therapy in the ED and subsequent hospitalization for asthma was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Analyses were adjusted for year epoch at enrollment, receipt of IV magnesium, PRAM score after initial therapy and at ED disposition, age, sex, duration of respiratory distress, previous intensive care unit admission for asthma, hospitalizations for asthma within the past year, atopy, and receipt of oral corticosteroids within 48 hours before arrival in the ED, nebulized magnesium, and additional albuterol after inhaled magnesium or placebo, with site as a random effect.

Results

Among the 816 participants, the median age was 5 years (interquartile range, 3–7 years), 517 (63.4%) were boys, and 364 (44.6%) were hospitalized. A total of 215 children (26.3%) received IV magnesium, and 190 (88.4%) of these children were hospitalized compared with 174 of 601 children (29.0%) who did not receive IV magnesium. Multivariable factors associated with hospitalization were IV magnesium receipt from 2011 to 2016 (odds ratio [OR], 22.67; 95% CI, 6.26–82.06; P < .001) and from 2017 to 2019 (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.99–8.86; P < .001), use of additional albuterol (OR, 5.94; 95% CI, 3.52–10.01; P < .001), and increase in PRAM score at disposition (per 1-U increase: OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.89–2.65; P < .001). In children with a disposition PRAM score of 3 or lower, receipt of IV magnesium therapy was associated with hospitalization (OR, 8.52; 95% CI, 2.96–24.41; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

After adjustment for patient-level characteristics, receipt of IV magnesium therapy after initial asthma treatment in the ED was associated with subsequent hospitalization. This association also existed among children with mild asthma at ED disposition. Evidence of a benefit of IV magnesium regarding hospitalization may clarify its use in the treatment of refractory pediatric asthma.

### The use of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: rapid uptake of evidence in north American emergency departments [^2dbb070c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews of approximately 13 randomized trials support treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) in patients with severe acute asthma; however, little is known about its actual clinical use.

Objective

We sought to examine the use of intravenous MgSO(4) in the emergency department (ED) and physician attitudes toward its use.

Methods

Data for MgSO(4) use were obtained from observational cohort studies of ED patients with acute asthma. Investigators were asked about MgSO(4) through a brief Internet-based survey. The main outcomes were the percentage of sites reporting MgSO(4) use and patient factors that potentially modified the use of this agent.

Results

Among 9745 ED patients with acute asthma, 240 (2.5%) received MgSO(4). Increasing age, previous intubation, higher initial respiratory rate, lower initial PEF, higher number of beta-agonists in the ED, and use of systemic corticosteroids were associated with MgSO(4) use (P < .01). Overall, 103 (87%) of 119 potential sites completed the survey. Most (92%) respondents stated their EDs had MgSO(4) available, and 64% had recently used it. More respondents listed severity (96%) and failure to respond to initial beta-agonists (87%) as factors prompting their use of MgSO(4). Other factors, such as age, sex, and duration of exacerbation, less commonly influenced MgSO(4) use.

Conclusion

Most ED physicians accept the efficacy of MgSO(4) in acute asthma. Despite this belief and the ready availability of MgSO(4), its ED use remains uncommon (2.5% of cases). In both practice and theory, emergency physicians appear to appropriately restrict its use to patients with severe acute asthma.

### Management of life-threatening asthma: severe asthma series [^f6e516ca]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening, with 25,000 to 50,000 such patients per year requiring admission to an ICU in the United States. Appropriate triage of life-threatening asthma is dependent on both static assessment of airway function and dynamic assessment of response to therapy. Treatment strategies focus on achieving effective bronchodilation with inhaled β 2 -agonists, muscarinic antagonists, and magnesium sulphate while reducing inflammation with systemic corticosteroids. Correction of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, a key in managing life-threatening asthma, occasionally requires the incorporation of noninvasive mechanical ventilation to decrease the work of breathing. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should not be delayed if clinical improvement is not achieved with conservative therapies. However, mechanical ventilation in these patients often requires controlled hypoventilation, adequate sedation, and occasional use of muscle relaxation to avoid dynamic hyperinflation, which can result in barotrauma or volutrauma. Sedation with ketamine or propofol is preferred because of their potential bronchodilation properties. In this review, we outline strategies for the assessment and management of patients with acute life-threatening asthma focusing on those requiring admission to the ICU.

IV magnesium — dosing, monitoring, and benefit signals in pediatric critical asthma: IV magnesium is described as "readily available, relatively inexpensive, possesses a favorable safety profile, and is easily administered," and more rigorous studies "suggested a benefit to IV magnesium for intubation rates, stay, acute asthma severity score, nebulization rates, and cost." Reported dosing varied, with "intermittent doses ranging from 25 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg over 20–35 min," and "continuous infusions at approximately 20 mg/kg/h"; although "additional studies have shown that higher-dose continuous infusions may also be feasible and effective," "we cannot recommend a specific dosing regimen." Monitoring is advised because "patients should be monitored for adverse effects including hypotension and drug reactions (redness, warmth, tingling) at the infusion site," and when hypotension occurs, it "is usually mild and can be treated with fluid boluses or slowing the rate of IV magnesium infusion." A cost analysis also found IV magnesium "was associated with lower total cost compared with no IV magnesium."

### Use of magnesium sulfate in continuous infusion in patients with severe acute asthma, in a pediatric emergency room [^b75c86b2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic disease, of high prevalence, with important morbidity and that can lead to death in childhood. The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate has been indicated in cases refractory to the initial management with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.

Objective

To evaluate the use of magnesium sulfate in continuous infusion (50mg/kg/h in 4h) in children with severe acute asthma in a pediatric emergency room.

Location

Ten-bed general pediatric emergency room, university hospital, tertiary, in southern Brazil.

Patients

All children over 2 years old with severe acute asthma refractory to the initial treatment who received a continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate at a dose of 50mg/kg/h in 4h, from April 2017 to October 2019.

Conclusion

Based on this study, the use of continuous intravenous magnesium sulfate proved to be well tolerated, leading to improved respiratory status, and can be considered as a satisfactory adjunctive therapy in the management of severe acute asthma.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^422389a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e1a09c47]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations… [^f93be9ed]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is intravenous magnesium sulfate effective for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation that has not responded to first-line therapy can be treated effectively with intravenous magnesium sulfate. In children, magnesium sulfate reduced hospital admissions by 68%. In adults, magnesium sulfate reduced admissions by 25%. Evidence Summary A 2016 Cochrane review of three RCTs found that treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate reduced the odds of hospital admissions by 68% in patients 18 months to 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations. 1 Magnesium sulfate was given if inhaled short-acting bronchodilators and corticosteroids were ineffective. Dosing was not standardized, but most studies used weight-based dosing according to guidelines from the British National Formulary for Children, which advises 40 mg per kg of body weight, up to a maximal dose of 2 g, delivered as a single intravenous infusion over 20 minutes. The analysis was limited because of the number and size of studies, but there were no reports of harm. Patients were not grouped based on an asthma severity score, such as the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score or the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. A 2014 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs found a 25% reduction in hospital admissions in adults who were treated in the emergency department with intravenous magnesium sulfate for asthma exacerbation. 2 The number needed to treat to prevent one admission was 7.

Most of the studies were double-blinded trials comparing intravenous magnesium sulfate vs. placebo after first-line therapy was ineffective. The authors reported statistically significant but clinically minimal improvements in the secondary outcomes of forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow. Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend treating patients with acute asthma exacerbation with repeated doses of short-acting bronchodilators, early oral corticosteroids, and controlled-flow oxygen if available. 3 In those with severe exacerbations, ipratropium should be added and nebulized short-acting bronchodilators should be considered. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered if the patient does not respond to intensive initial treatment. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^0fca1e13]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant drug

Novel adjuvant drugs have also been shown to be effective in modulating the outcome of vaso-occlusive crisis when used in conjunction with the conventional pain-management protocols. For instance, a group of investigators studied the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on the duration of hospitalization for children admitted with vaso-occlusive crisis. Two sequential treatment protocols of intravenous magnesium sulfate were added to standard inpatient management comprising intravenous fluids, opioids, and NSAIDs. Interestingly, intravenous magnesium sulfate apparently reduced the duration of hospitalization for these children in crisis. Although magnesium sulfate had been found effective in severe asthma attacksand in reducing systolic blood pressure in eclampsia of pregnancy, its potentially beneficial use in SCD vaso-occlusive crisis may be related to the vasodilatory action in blood pressure reduction.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^760bc6a1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Children who received MgSO 4 have significantly better PEFR (presented as % predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; MD: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%) (figure 4A). However, there was no significant difference in FEV 1 (MD: 8.1; 95% CI: −3 to +19). We also compared the effect of MgSO 4 and placebo on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation). Infants who received MgSO 4 have slightly lower respiratory rates than the control group (MD: 0.9; 95% CI: −1.4 to −0.4); however, having any clinical significance was unlikely. There was no significant difference in heart rate and oxygen saturation (figure 4B). There was no significant difference in the need for hospitalisation, ICU admission or hospital stay (table 1 and online supplemental figures 1–3). There are some concerns that MgSO 4 can lead to respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia; therefore, we compared adverse events between the two groups as a safety outcome. We did not observe any increased adverse event rates with MgSO 4 (online supplemental figure 4 and table 1).

### Intravenous magnesium: prompt use for asthma in children treated in the emergency department (IMPACT-ED), a pilot randomized trial [^719aef8c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary measures

Participants were categorized in two populations for study goals and outcomes. Participants who were enrolled were included in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population. Participants in whom the study drug infusion was started were included in the safety population.
Patient enrollment: A patient was considered enrolled at the time of randomization. The rate of enrollment was considered the number of enrolled patients divided by the number of days between the day of site activation and the last day of screening at the site, inclusive, then multiplied by seven to convert to enrollments per week. The prespecified goal was to enroll at least one participant per site per week, enrolling 90 participants among all sites.
Delivery of study drug within 90 min of start of asthma treatment: This was defined as whether the number of minutes between the start of the first albuterol treatment administered in the ED and the start of the study drug infusion was 90 min or less. In one instance where the first recorded albuterol treatment administration began after study drug administration began, we made the post hoc modification to use the earliest albuterol order time as the start of asthma treatment. The prespecified goal was to deliver study drug within 90 min to 90% or more of participants.
Successful collection of blood pressure measurements: For the ITT analysis, among participants who received study drug there were to be 11 blood pressure measurements (once from 0 to 10 min before study drug infusion start and then every 10 min after start of infusion at 10 ± 4 min, 20 ± 4 min,… 90 ± 4 min and finally at 120 ± 10 min after start of infusion). For the ITT analysis, participants who did not receive study drug were required to have only one (naturally preinfusion) blood pressure measurement. The prespecified goal was to collect 90% or more of planned blood pressure measurements within defined time frames.
Serum magnesium concentrations: Blood samples were to be drawn by clinical staff through the IV at the time of placement, then through the IV directly or using a needle‐free blood collection device (PIVO, BD) to draw samples from the bloodstream through the IV 20–40 min and 90–150 min after start of study infusion. Samples were to be spun within 30 min and frozen at −80°C until being shipped to the central laboratory. Measurements of SrMg (quantitative spectrophotometry assay, Beckman Coulter), ioMg (ion‐selective electrode method, Nova Biomedical), and pH were performed at the University of California–Davis. The number of blood samples to be obtained did not have a prespecified goal.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^5b94ebe4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The findings in those 2 studies, may be explained by the administration of IV magnesium to children with more severe asthma, who are more refractory to treatment. Moreover, the initial severity of illness among those treated with IV magnesium may be associated with reduced likelihood of ED discharge despite satisfactory clinical improvement. To our knowledge, no previous study has explored the real-life association between IV magnesium use, clinical asthma severity over time, and hospitalization.

To explore the association between asthma severity, IV magnesium therapy, and hospitalization among children with refractory acute asthma, we conducted a secondary analysis of a recent multicenter RCT. The trial found that the administration of nebulized magnesium sulfate with albuterol to children who continued to experience moderate to severe respiratory distress after standardized initial therapy did not convey any benefit compared with placebo with albuterol. Because many children in the trial also received IV magnesium after inhaled magnesium or placebo and asthma severity was measured using the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score, the trial offered a unique opportunity to assess the association between receipt of IV magnesium therapy in the ED and subsequent hospitalization. We hypothesized that children administered IV magnesium would be more likely to be hospitalized compared with those not given IV magnesium after adjustment for patient-level variables.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^816534eb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of adjuvant nebulised/inhaled MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy for acute exacerbation in childhood asthma. Overall, 10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with asthma were included. Low-certainty evidence suggests that add-on therapy with inhaled MgSO 4 in acute exacerbation of childhood asthma does not decrease the severity of asthma exacerbation and hence does not improve the immediate asthma exacerbation control. It does not reduce the need for hospitalisation, ICU admission or length of hospital stay (low to very low certainty). However, it does benefit the pulmonary functions in terms of improved PEFR (low-certainty evidence). There is very low-certainty evidence that adjuvant inhaled MgSO 4 does not increase adverse events like hypotension, bradycardia or respiratory depression.

MgSO 4 has many mechanisms through which it was thought to have possible beneficial effects on asthma. MgSO 4 inhibits calcium ion influx, acetylcholine and histamine release from cholinergic motor nerve terminals and mast cells. Simultaneously, it promoted the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These actions lead to bronchodilation, an essential aspect of asthma management. Also, it may augment the responsiveness of β-receptors to salbutamol and hence can play a complementary role. Furthermore, it stabilises T cells, neutrophils and mast cells, and has anti-inflammatory properties. By virtue of these potential actions, its use has increased significantly in asthma management despite the absence of strong evidence favouring it.

Intravenous and nebulised preparations have been extensively used in various clinical trials in children and adults. There are conflicting reports on the efficacy of intravenous MgSO 4 in adults and paediatric asthma. A recent systematic review in adults with asthma found no significant effect of intravenous MgSO 4 on critical clinical outcomes. In contrast, a review in children suggests that it may reduce the need for hospitalisation and improve lung functions. However, the later evidence is based on extremely limited data and is subject to extreme uncertainty.

### IV magnesium sulfate for bronchiolitis: a randomized trial [^3a5fdf15]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this study was to determine if IV magnesium, useful for severe pediatric asthma, reduces time to medical readiness for discharge in patients with bronchiolitis when added to supportive care.

Methods

We compared a single dose of 100 mg/kg of IV magnesium sulfate vs placebo for acute bronchiolitis. Patients received bronchodilator therapy, nebulized hypertonic saline, and 5 days of dexamethasone if there was eczema and/or a family history of asthma. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary efficacy outcome. Bronchiolitis severity scores and need for infirmary or hospital admission and for clinic revisits within 2 weeks were secondary outcomes. Cardiorespiratory instability onset was the safety outcome.

Results

A total of 162 previously healthy infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis aged 22 days to 17.6 months (median, 3.7 months) were enrolled. Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0–29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3–31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52–1.80]; P = 0.91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar. Fifteen magnesium recipients (19.5%) vs five placebo recipients (6.2%) were readmitted to the infirmary or hospital within 2 weeks (P = 0.016). No acute cardiorespiratory side effects were reported.

Conclusions

IV magnesium did not provide benefit for patients with acute bronchiolitis and may be harmful.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2c0a9e61]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects ~300 million people worldwide, reaching up to 18% of the population in certain countries.

Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and other respiratory complaints. Most of the time these symptoms are mild and can be controlled with inhalers and avoidance of known allergens, but other times they can lead to exacerbations that can be life threatening. An estimated annual 300,000 deaths worldwide are attributed to asthma.

The mainstay of management is a beta-agonist and corticosteroids inhaler. However, new investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease are emerging. For example, many reports have observed that low blood levels and low dietary intake of magnesium are factors that possibly contribute to the development of asthma. – In addition, low levels of magnesium have been detected in asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics, especially those that have presented to the emergency department with exacerbations. –

Magnesium deficiency has a role in many diseases in addition to asthma, including migraines, depression, and epilepsy.– Although the exact role magnesium has in asthma is not completely understood, it is known that it functions as an anti-inflammatory agent in addition to its role in inhibiting the effect of calcium to contract smooth muscle.–

Previous trials showed that magnesium use through intravenous or inhaled routes does have a role in managing asthma in acute exacerbations. – However, studies published on the benefits of oral supplements have reported unclear conclusions.– Major problems with these trials regarding randomization, placebo use, intervention duration, outcome measurements, and baseline level of serum magnesium may explain the conflicting results.

The role of intravenous and inhaled magnesium in the management of acute asthma has been extensively studied and the guidelines are well established. IV or inhaled routes can be used as a last resort for severe, persistent asthma that fails to respond to conventional treatment. Nevertheless, oral magnesium is not included in these guidelines.

Our aim in this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of all published reports on the effect of oral magnesium for the management of chronic asthma.

### Evaluation and treatment of critical asthma syndrome in children [^79aba7f4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of asthma is illustrated by the significantly different features of pediatric asthma compared to adult asthma. One phenotype of severe asthma in pediatrics includes atopy, lack of reduction in lung function, and absence of gender bias as the main characteristics. Included in the NIH NAEPP EPR-3 are recommendations for the treatment and management of severe pediatric asthma and critical asthma syndrome, such as continuous nebulization treatments, intubation and mechanical ventilation, heliox, and magnesium sulfate. In addition, epinephrine, intravenous immunoglobulin, intravenous montelukast, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and many biological modulators currently under investigation are additional current and/or future treatment modalities for the severe pediatric asthmatic. But, perhaps the most important strategy for managing the severe asthmatic is preventative treatment, which can significantly decrease impairment and risk, particularly for severe acute exacerbations requiring emergency care and/or hospitalization. In order for preventative therapy to be successful, several challenges must be met, including selecting the correct therapy for each patient and then ensuring compliance or adherence to a treatment plan. The heterogeneity of asthma renders the former difficult in that not all patients will respond equally to the same treatment; the latter is only helpful if the correct treatment is employed. Strategies to ensure compliance include education of caregivers and patients and their families. As newer medications are introduced, options for individualized or customized medicine increase, and this may pave the way for significant decreases in morbidity and mortality in severe pediatric asthma.

### Nasal high-flow oxygen versus conventional oxygen therapy for acute severe asthma patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^019e88ef]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Protocol and Interventions

After arrival in the ED, all patients were assessed consecutively for eligibility by an ED physician. If acute severe asthma was suspected, the physician gave standard treatment as per recommendation, 1 which included up to three doses of nebulized beta‐agonist and anticholinergics every 20 minutes. Oxygen therapy was given via nebulization during a 60‐minute run‐in period. Systemic corticosteroid and magnesium sulfate were given and investigations such as laboratory analysis and chest radiographs were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. This physician then notified a project investigator, who confirmed and reassessed eligibility at 60 minutes after initial management. This run‐in period was designed to exclude patients whose severity of acute attack was too mild or too severe, who might not have completed the study protocol. If eligibility was confirmed, the project investigator enrolled the patient, obtained informed consent, randomized the interventions, and completed data collection. A computer‐generated, mixed‐block (block size of 2 and 4) randomization for sequence assignment (1:1 ratio) was performed using sealed opaque envelopes.

Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either COT or NHF for 120 minutes. COT was given by a standard oxygen nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask. NHF was delivered by a high‐flow blower‐humidifier AIRVO 2 via Optiflow medium‐sized high‐flow nasal cannula (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand). The initial NHF rate was 35 L/min and could be adjusted from 30 to 60 L/min according to the participant's level of comfort. FiO 2 was adjusted in both groups to achieve a steady state SpO 2 of 95% to 99% or 90% to 92% if the patients' baseline SpO 2 at room was less than 92%.

During the trial, all participants received standard treatments and interventions, including continued doses of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroid, and magnesium sulfate if not given prior to reassessment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and other treatments as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. After the trial, standard of care for acute severe asthma and other treatments were delivered at the discretion of the treating physicians.

### The cost-utility of intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating asthma exacerbations in children [^90d73ab5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although evidence supports the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MS) in asthma exacerbations, MS continues to be considered a second-line drug for managing pediatric asthma exacerbations. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of MS in asthma exacerbations.

Methods

We used a decision tree model to estimate the cost-utility of MS compared to treatment without MS (control group) in children with asthma exacerbations. Cost data were obtained from a retrospective study from tertiary centers in Rionegro, Colombia, while utilities were collected from the literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Monte Carlo technique with a simulation of a hypothetical cohort of 10000 patients to generate expected cost utilities with 95% confidence intervals. We used a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to evaluate the uncertainty surrounding the cost-utility of MS.

Results

The model showed that MS had a lower total cost than the control group (US $1149 vs US $1598 average cost per patient) and higher quality-adjusted life years (0.60 vs 0.52 average per patient), showing dominance. The probability that MS provides a more cost-effective use of resources compared with standard therapy exceeds 99% for all willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Conclusion

Intravenous MS was less expensive and more effective than treatment without intravenous MS in children with asthma exacerbations. Our study provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines and should be replicated to validate its results in other middle-income countries.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^3e52339d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and related hospitalizations, with associated costs of approximately $4 billion annually in the US. Although systemic corticosteroids, inhaled β 2 agonists, and anticholinergics are recommended for the management of severe exacerbations, some children are resistant to this therapy, in part owing to genetic polymorphisms. For children experiencing ongoing respiratory distress after initial management, intravenous (IV) magnesium therapy represents a potential second-line treatment option.

Almost all international asthma management guidelines recommend consideration of IV magnesium as ancillary therapy in children with severe acute asthma. However, the evidence of IV magnesium benefit is, to our knowledge, limited to disparate results from 3 small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (a total of 115 patients). A decade ago, IV magnesium was generally not used to prevent asthma-related hospitalizations, and only 12% of children hospitalized for asthma received IV magnesium in the ED. A recent Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry reportfound that only 10% of children treated for asthma in the ED were treated with IV magnesium. A 2017 report from the Pediatric Health Information System Data Collaborativefound that although the use of IV magnesium was increasing, 36% of children hospitalized for asthma received IV magnesium. Neither study found an association between IV magnesium and lower hospitalization rates or lower likelihood of being treated in the intensive care unit.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^fcbf7caa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of an RCT, we found that the administration of IV magnesium therapy among children with refractory acute asthma was associated with hospitalization independent of asthma severity and other patient-level characteristics. Furthermore, after adjustment for patient-level characteristics, this association was also evident among children who met criteria for hospital discharge at the time of ED disposition. Future research on the benefit of IV magnesium therapy in reducing hospitalization and the related safety profile may clarify the role of this therapy in refractory pediatric asthma.

### Principal findings of systematic reviews of acute asthma treatment in childhood [^6de82fc0]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to summarize the principal findings in the literature about acute asthma management in children.

Methods

Systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (SRCTs) with or without meta-analysis in children (1–18 years) admitted to the emergency department (ED) were retrieved using five data bases. Methodological quality was determined using the AMSTAR tool.

Results

One hundred and three studies were retrieved. Among those, 28 SRCTs were included: seven SRCTs related to short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), three to ipratropium bromide (IB), eight to corticosteroids, one to racemic adrenaline, one to leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), four to magnesium sulfate, one to intravenous (IV) SABA, one to IV aminophylline, one to IV ketamine, and one to antibiotics. It was determined that administering SABA by MDI-VHC is superior to using a nebulizer, because it decreases the hospital admission rate, improves the clinical score, results in a shorter time in the ED, and causes fewer adverse effects. Levalbuterol and albuterol were similar. In patients with moderate to severe exacerbations, IB+SABA was superior to SABA, decreasing hospital admission and improving the clinical score. SABA heliox administered by nebulizer decreased exacerbation severity compared to oxygen. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), especially administered by nebulizer, showed results similar to oral corticosteroids (OCS) with respect to reducing hospital admission, unscheduled visits, and the requirement of additional systemic corticosteroids. ICS or OCS following ED discharge was similar with regard to relapse. Compared with a placebo, IV magnesium reduced hospital admission and improved lung function.

Conclusions

SRCTs are useful for guiding decisions in acute asthma treatment.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^88b50122]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

To address the lack of guidance for clinicians in their care of children with critical asthma, a multidisciplinary team of medical providers used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to make the following recommendations: 1. We suggest the use of continuous inhaled short-acting β agonist (SABA) over frequent intermittent SABA in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 2. We suggest the use of either high- or low-dose continuous inhaled SABA regimens in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 3. We suggest the use of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) for children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 4. We suggest the use of intravenous (IV) magnesium (intermittent or continuous) as an adjunct therapy in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence) 5. We cannot recommend for or against the use of IV methylxanthines as an adjunct therapy in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 6. We suggest the use of an IV SABA infusion as an adjunct therapy in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence) 7. We cannot recommend for or against the application of high-flow nasal cannula versus conventional oxygen therapy in children presenting with critical asthma with persistent hypoxemia and/or respiratory distress. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 8. We suggest the use of bi-level positive airway pressure over conventional oxygen therapy in children presenting with critical asthma with persistent hypoxemia and/or respiratory distress. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 9. We cannot recommend for or against the application of bi-level positive airway pressure over high-flow nasal cannula for children hospitalized with critical asthma with persistent hypoxemia and/or respiratory distress. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 10. We cannot recommend for or against the application of heliox in children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence) 11. We suggest the use of a dedicated protocol or pathway for managing children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^99c1a2ac]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of oral magnesium on chronic asthma. The results of the measured outcomes was overall precise and nonsignificant (except for FEV1 at week 8). None of the trials reported on mortality or adverse events. Certainty in these estimates is low. There was some high heterogeneity, which could be explained by different type, dose, or duration of the intervention across the experimental groups in the involved RCTs. We excluded crossover RCTs due to uncertainty over washout periods of magnesium. We have identified ongoing trials registered in Clinicaltrials.gov, which might have future implications on the conclusion reached in this study.

The role of magnesium in bronchial asthma has been discussed in the recent GINA guidelines. The evidence supports the use of intravenous magnesium in acute situations, especially with asthmatics that do not respond to initial management. However, the routine use of intravenous magnesium in acute or chronic asthma is not supported by evidence. Nevertheless, the use of oral magnesium for the prevention of asthma exacerbations or to improve control has not been discussed in the GINA report. Other supplements, such as vitamin D, were mentioned in GINA. In the present study, only FEV1 was shown to be significantly improved with oral magnesium.

However, encouraging findings were found especially in Kazak's study including a significant increase in the concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% drop in FEV1 at 6 months, and a 5.8% improvement in PEFR and an improvement in subjective measures (AQLQ, ACQ) all noticed at 6.5 months in subjects who were in the treatment group. Therefore, there is a need for future large, high quality RCTs to reliably determine the role of oral magnesium in asthma management. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analyses evaluating the use of magnesium supplements as an adjunct treatment to inhalers for asthmatics.

There are several limitations to this study. First, sample sizes are considered relatively small for a common disease like asthma, some trials recruited less than fifty participants. Second, important data were missing in some of the trials; strategies we used to overcome this problem were discussed in the methodology above. Additionally, we were not able to assess the effect of the intervention on reducing the dose of inhaled steroid, because it was only reported in a single study which showed no benefit.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^b4f993f9]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this secondary analysis of a multicenter RCT of children refractory to optimized initial asthma therapy in the ED, we found that after adjustment for patient-level covariates, administration of IV magnesium therapy was associated with subsequent hospitalization, and the odds of hospitalization after receiving IV magnesium decreased over time. Furthermore, children eligible for discharge home after treatment with IV magnesium had 8 times higher odds of hospitalization compared with children who did not receive IV magnesium after adjustment for asthma severity and other patient-level characteristics.

The decision to administer IV magnesium may influence or follow the decision of the ED physicians to request hospital admission. This study's findings are not consistent with the conclusions of previous systematic reviews, which reported that IV magnesium therapy was associated with a reduction in hospitalizations among children with refractory acute asthma. Several factors may account for this discrepancy. First, IV magnesium therapy is a second-line intervention typically reserved for patients with more sever illness and therefore may be associated with a low threshold for hospitalization. Second, the half-life of IV magnesium is short, and the duration of its clinical effect in patients with asthma is unknown. This uncertainty may be associated with reluctance to discharge patients home without further clinical and safety data. Third, although ED throughput benchmarking requires efficient patient disposition decisions, the need for continued observation after administration of IV magnesium before discharge home may also contribute to the propensity of near-routine hospitalization after IV magnesium therapy. Fourth, the minimal change in PRAM scores between 60 minutes after randomization and the time of ED disposition in children administered IV magnesium suggests a poor clinical response to the overall ED therapy, which may have been associated with hospital admission decisions. In addition, the unknown safety associated with discharging a patient home after administration of IV magnesium is a likely contributor to the aforementioned practice pattern. Of importance, the association between IV magnesium therapy and hospitalization decreased over time. Although the reasons for this change remain uncertain, the trend may reflect increasing comfort of the ED physicians with discharging patients home after IV magnesium therapy.
