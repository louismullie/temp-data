## Question

Are there any specific laboratory tests that can confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are specific laboratory tests that can confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any authoritative sources describe a definitive laboratory assay for confirming ingestion. Then, I should verify what routine labs are recommended and whether they can establish causation. Next, I will consider indirect markers and their limitations. After that, I should review imaging-based evidence that often substitutes for laboratory confirmation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach and state the bottom line clearly with supporting references [^11583ury] [^115enDjH] [^111cHBs5].

> Let me first confirm the core question: is there a specific blood or urine test that proves hydrogen peroxide ingestion, or do we rely on clinical context and supportive findings instead. I need to check authoritative guidance and case-based literature to ensure I'm not missing a niche assay or a validated biomarker that clinicians actually use in practice [^11583ury] [^115enDjH].

> Wait, let me verify the authoritative statements. The CDC medical management guidance explicitly states there are no specific blood or urine tests that can show whether a person has been exposed to hydrogen peroxide, which directly addresses the user's question about confirmatory laboratory testing [^115enDjH]. The ATSDR ToxFAQs similarly notes there are no clinical tests that demonstrate hydrogen peroxide exposure, reinforcing that there is no validated confirmatory lab assay for ingestion [^111cHBs5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review what laboratories are actually recommended and whether any of those could be misconstrued as confirmatory. The WSES caustic ingestion guideline recommends obtaining CBC, liver tests, electrolytes, renal function, pH, lactate, and β-hCG in appropriate patients, but these are for assessing systemic injury and guiding management, not for confirming the ingested agent identity, and normal results do not exclude significant injury or embolic risk [^11583ury] [^111nS4Q2]. I should double-check that these labs are framed as supportive rather than diagnostic for the specific toxin, which they are in the guideline narrative [^11583ury].

> I will now examine whether any indirect laboratory markers could serve as a proxy for ingestion. Elevated troponin, metabolic acidosis, and lactate elevation have been reported in severe cases, particularly with gas embolism or caustic injury, but these are nonspecific and reflect end-organ ischemia or metabolic derangement rather than confirming hydrogen peroxide exposure itself; importantly, normal values do not exclude serious complications, so they cannot be used to confirm ingestion [^115dvQCT] [^111nS4Q2]. Let me reconsider whether any of these could be considered pathognomonic; none are, and they must be interpreted in clinical context alongside history and imaging [^115dvQCT].

> Next, I should review what actually provides the strongest supportive evidence when ingestion is suspected. Imaging frequently demonstrates portal venous gas or other embolic phenomena after hydrogen peroxide ingestion, and this radiologic signature — especially portal venous gas on CT — is commonly used as objective evidence of the pathophysiology triggered by ingestion; however, even imaging is supportive rather than absolutely specific to hydrogen peroxide, as other conditions can rarely cause portal venous gas [^115dvQCT] [^113c2LDF]. I need to ensure I emphasize that imaging complements, but does not replace, clinical history and exposure assessment in confirming causation [^notfound].

> But wait, what if someone proposes a breath test because hydrogen peroxide generates oxygen; could exhaled oxygen or a modified breath test confirm ingestion. Let me think about that carefully. Hydrogen breath testing is designed to detect microbial hydrogen and methane production, not oxygen liberated from chemical decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and there is no validated breath test for confirming hydrogen peroxide ingestion; moreover, standard breath testing methodology and indications do not encompass this use-case, so this would be a misapplication of existing technology [^11297qob]. I should confirm that no guideline or study endorses breath testing for hydrogen peroxide confirmation, and indeed none do [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any niche chemical test on gastric contents has been described. The CDC document mentions a colorimetric reaction using titanium chloride that can suggest peroxide in gastric aspirate, but this is not a routine clinical laboratory test, lacks standardized validation for emergency diagnostics, and is not a substitute for clinical diagnosis; it may be considered investigational or adjunctive in select contexts but should not be relied upon for definitive confirmation in standard care pathways [^115enDjH]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not broadly adopted in practice; case series and guidelines do not present this as a standard confirmatory assay, supporting its limited utility [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach so I don't miss anything critical. Diagnosis of hydrogen peroxide ingestion is primarily clinical, grounded in exposure history, timing, concentration, and volume, with supportive evidence from imaging when gas embolism is suspected and routine labs used to assess injury severity and guide monitoring; early CT can detect portal venous gas and inform decisions about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but again, this supports the clinical diagnosis rather than providing a laboratory confirmation of ingestion [^11583ury] [^113c2LDF] [^115dvQCT]. I need to ensure I note that most clinically significant embolic events occur within 10 hours, which shapes observation and imaging strategies in suspected exposures [^111cCBB8].

> Bottom line, after verifying across guidelines and toxicology sources, there are no specific laboratory tests — blood, urine, or breath — that confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion; clinicians should base diagnosis on history and clinical presentation, use routine labs to assess systemic effects, and employ imaging to identify gas embolism when suspected, recognizing that normal laboratory results do not exclude serious toxicity [^115enDjH] [^111cHBs5] [^11583ury] [^115dvQCT].

There are **no specific laboratory tests** that confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^111cHBs5]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by history and imaging [^113c2LDF]. Routine labs (CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, lactate, ABG) assess systemic injury but are **not diagnostic** [^11583ury]. Portal venous gas on CT is a key radiologic finding [^115dvQCT], but labs cannot confirm ingestion or embolic risk [^115enDjH] [^115dvQCT]. If ingestion is suspected, obtain labs to guide management, but **do not rely on them for confirmation** [^111nS4Q2].

---

## Laboratory tests commonly performed

Although no test confirms ingestion, the following labs are commonly obtained to assess systemic effects and guide management:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for bleeding, infection, or systemic inflammation [^11583ury].

- **Electrolytes, renal, and liver function tests**: Assess electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, and hepatic injury [^111nS4Q2].

- **Serum lactate**: Elevated in tissue hypoperfusion or metabolic acidosis from gas embolism or caustic injury [^11583ury].

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: Evaluate acid-base status and respiratory compromise [^112zjuZR].

- **Coagulation profile**: Assess for coagulopathy from hepatic injury or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of laboratory tests

Laboratory tests have **significant limitations** in confirming hydrogen peroxide ingestion:

- **Non-specificity**: Routine labs reflect systemic injury but are not specific to hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^115enDjH].

- **Normal results do not exclude injury**: Normal labs can occur even with significant gastrointestinal injury or gas embolism [^115dvQCT].

- **Lack of specific biomarkers**: No validated biomarkers or assays detect hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^111cHBs5].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is critical for detecting complications, especially gas embolism. Portal venous gas on **abdominal CT** is a hallmark of hydrogen peroxide ingestion and indicates significant embolic risk [^115dvQCT] [^115orNrn]. Chest radiography may reveal pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum from gas embolism [^notfound], and brain MRI can identify cerebral gas embolism and ischemic injury [^115vCHna].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **clinical and imaging-based approach**:

- **WSES guidelines**: Obtain CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, lactate, ABG, and coagulation profile to assess systemic injury, but do not rely on labs for diagnosis [^11583ury].

- **Imaging**: Use CT to detect portal venous gas and guide management, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) [^113c2LDF] [^115dvQCT].

- **Poison control**: Contact poison control centers for systemic toxicity assessment and management guidance [^1124aWiX].

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^115dvQCT]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Both our patients underwent HBOT, resulting in the rapid and complete resolution of the radiological signs of portal venous gas. Patient A's neurological symptoms improved gradually, which may indicate a persistent ischaemic effect of cerebral arterial gas emboli, despite the absence of radiological signs on the initial cerebral scan.

In the case of Patient B, who initially had the presence of portal venous gas with no other symptoms, one may wonder whether HBOT was superfluous or whether it reduced the risk of secondary systemic embolism. We opted for hyperbaric oxygen for the patient due to the early onset of poisoning symptoms, the high concentration of the ingested hydrogen peroxide and the observation that Patient A, who consumed the same concentration and dose at the same time, exhibited symptoms consistent with cerebral gas embolism. The troponin-T peak, recorded 21 hours after poisoning, suggests the occurrence of a cardiac embolism as a possible cause. However, it remains unclear whether HBOT influenced cardiac function, as the timing of ECG and biomarker changes does not suggest a direct causal relationship with the therapy.

Whether the presence of portal venous gas alone after hydrogen peroxide poisoning is an indication for HBOT remains unclear. In the two cases reported here, there was a discrepancy between the laboratory results, which remained within normal ranges, and the presence of portal venous gas on imaging. This underscores the limitation of laboratory tests (eg, liver function test) in distinguishing patients who may remain asymptomatic from those who may become symptomatic and experience clinical deterioration in cases of hydrogen peroxide poisoning. Published evidence suggests that higher concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide may be associated with increased complications. Also, evidence shows that 'over 90% of embolic symptoms occurred within 10 hours of ingestion'. Based on this evidence and on the cases reported here, we suggest that for asymptomatic patients, assessed within a few hours after highly concentrated and/or high-volume hydrogen peroxide ingestion, an immediate CT scan may be useful to assess the presence of portal gas. If imaging shows portal gas in these cases, it may be reasonable to promptly transfer the patients to a facility equipped with HBOT, should the patient become symptomatic or display signs of gas embolism.

Discussion

Breath testing remains a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic tool in gastroenterology. Using an evidence-based approach, consensus was reached on 26 statements providing practical guidance regarding the indications, preparation, performance and interpretation of BT in clinical practice and research. Furthermore, current gaps of knowledge are identified for future research directives. As compared to previous guidelines, these consensus statements are updated based on the most recent literature and provide detailed recommendations and clarity on drug regimens prior to BT, dose of substrates, established indications, limitations and interpretation of the results based on both hydrogen and methane gases.

While unanswered questions remain and there are challenges that need further clarification, it is hoped that these consensus statements create uniformity in the use of BT and thus improve and optimize patient care.

### Hemorrhagic gastritis and gas emboli after ingesting 3% hydrogen peroxide [^114Q2iHR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

It is well known that ingestion of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is usually nontoxic; this does not produce gas embolism and is only a mild irritant to the gastrointestinal tract. We report the case of a 25-year-old woman who ingested one mouthful of 3% hydrogen peroxide and presented to the Emergency Department with persistent vomiting and epigastric pain. The radiographic evaluation found portal venous gas emboli. In addition, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 2 h after ingestion revealed diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis. She showed a decrease of hemoglobin concentration and a positive test result for occult blood in stool. She was observed for 14 days and discharged. Follow-up endoscopy showed erythematous gastritis. This case illustrates that a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide can cause portal venous gas embolism and severe gastrointestinal injuries even if only a small amount is ingested.

### Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests [^1166yH6q]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Hydrogen breath tests are widely used to explore the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been proposed to be of great importance for symptoms in, for instance, irritable bowel syndrome. However, conclusions drawn from these studies are highly controversial and divergent results exist. There is also an extensive use of these tests in clinical practice with difficulties regarding interpretation of the tests and sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the occasional abuse of these tests can be turned into proper clinical and scientific use instead in the future.

### Hydrogen peroxide solution ingestion caused brain death of a 3-year-old girl [^113ckSrU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide solutions are often used in daily life as a household disinfectant and in cosmetic products and are therefore a common source of intentional poisonings, especially for children. When ingested in small amounts, it may cause severe central nervous system damage as a result of arterial emboli like our case. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in this situation is known, but the neurologic deficits of our case did not improve with this method and finally brain death occurred. This is may be related by the timing of treatment after the event. We would like to emphasize that every clinician must be aware of the dangers of hydrogen peroxide ingestion and hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be of benefit if it is performed immediately.

### Delayed-onset portal venous thrombosis after ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide [^115orNrn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Identification of portal venous gas on radiographic imaging is well documented after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, as is its resolution after hyperbaric therapy. Although hyperbaric therapy may resolve the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the presence of portal venous gas, the principle rationale for performing hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system oxygen embolization.

Case Report

We describe a patient with portal venous gas identified by computed tomography after the ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide, managed without hyperbaric therapy, who subsequently developed portal venous thrombosis. We are not aware of this complication being previously described from hydrogen peroxide ingestion. The case is complicated by the coexistence of a self-inflicted stab wound, leading to exploratory laparotomy in a patient predisposed to arterial vascular occlusion. Why Should an EmergencyPhysicianBeAware of This? Emergency physicians will encounter patients after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide who, despite not having symptoms of central nervous system emboli, have portal venous gas identified on radiographic imaging. Being aware that the principle rationale for prophylactic utilization of hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system emboli, and that in at least one case, delayed-onset portal venous thrombosis has occurred without hyperbaric therapy may help contribute to clinical decision-making.

New techniques note that current breath tests have low sensitivity and specificity and need additional validation; the lactulose breath test has been criticized for high false-positive values and the glucose breath test for low sensitivity for detecting distal SIBO; a unique orally ingested capsule technology under development can measure in vivo hydrogen and carbon dioxide after a carbohydrate meal and may provide a better alternative to current breath hydrogen measurement techniques.

### Cerebral air gas embolism from concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^115vCHna]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ingestion of a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause cerebral air gas embolism (CAGE). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the standard of care in the treatment of CAGE. We report a case of CAGE after accidental ingestion of 33%hydrogen peroxide treated with HBOT resulting in reversal of both the clinical and radiologic abnormalities.

Case Report

A 48 year-old male took two sips of 33% hydrogen peroxide. A short time later, he developed hematemesis, left sided hemiplegia, confusion, and left homonymous hemianopsia. Initial laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and brain CT were normal. MRI demonstrated areas of restricted diffusion and T2 hyper intensities in multiple vascular territories consistent with ischemia due to CAGE. Eighteen hours after arrival, the patient underwent HBOT at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 30 minutes and 2.5 ATA for 60 minutes with clinical improvement. Follow-up MRI at six months demonstrated resolution of the hyper intensities.

Discussion

A search of MEDLINE from 1950 to present revealed only two cases of CAGE from ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide treated with HBOT. Both cases, similar to ours, had complete resolution of symptoms. Of the seven reported cases of CAGE from hydrogen peroxide that did not undergo HBOT, only in one patient was there a report of symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Ingestion of even a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can result in cerebral air gas embolism. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be of benefit in reversing the symptoms and preventing permanent neurological impairment.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^112uFYDU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Finally, most of the cases described in the literature develop symptoms within the first hour, but the time taken to treat them varies. Early HBOT appears to reduce the risk of complications or death. Therefore, it is important to refer the patient to the nearest hyperbaric medicine centre if there is radiological or clinical evidence of gas embolism.

Learning points

There is an inter-individual variability in patients' symptomatology, despite the same concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide ingested.
Hydrogen peroxide poisoning can result in significant portal venous gas, which may remain asymptomatic or progress to symptomatic arterial gas embolism. Even in asymptomatic patients (ie, presence of portal venous gas without embolism), imaging (considered alongside the concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide and the timing of ingestion) may help clinicians in deciding whether to initiate hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
HBOT is an effective treatment for gas in the portal system or arterial gas embolism caused by hydrogen peroxide poisoning and should be considered as soon as possible in severe cases.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^115wG6NQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given the presence of venous portal gas in Patient A, Patient B also underwent a CT scan, which also revealed venous portal gas. He did not develop any neurological symptoms.

Meanwhile, the bottle with the unknown liquid was taken to the toxicology laboratory for analysis, and almost pure hydrogen peroxide was identified (ie, > 90%).

Given the presence of portal venous gas on imaging in both patients, along with clinical symptoms in Patient A indicative of a possible cerebral arterial gas embolism, both patients were promptly transferred to the nearest hyperbaric medicine centre.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the prevention of arterial gas embolism in food grade hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^114XxW1u]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Food grade hydrogen peroxide ingestion is a relatively rare presentation to the emergency department. There are no defined guidelines at this time regarding the treatment of such exposures, and providers may not be familiar with the potential complications associated with high concentration hydrogen peroxide ingestions. In this case series, we describe four patients who consumed 35% hydrogen peroxide, presented to the emergency department, and were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Two of the four patients were critically ill requiring intubation. All four patients had evidence on CT or ultrasound of venous gas emboli and intubated patients were treated as if they had an arterial gas embolism since an exam could not be followed. After hyperbaric oxygen therapy each patient was discharged from the hospital neurologically intact with no other associated organ injuries related to vascular gas emboli. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective treatment for patients with vascular gas emboli after high concentration hydrogen peroxide ingestion. It is the treatment of choice for any impending, suspected, or diagnosed arterial gas embolism. Further research is needed to determine which patients with portal venous gas emboli should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

### A rare case of portal vein gas: accidental hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^115ZG7Bf]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a colourless and odourless liquid with oxidant characteristics used for various purposes. Whereas in lower concentrations (3%), H(2)O(2) is used as a disinfectant in home cleaning products and wound care, in higher concentrations (35%) it is used in textile and paper industry as a bleaching agent and is diluted for use in lightening hair dyes. Like other caustic substances, direct injuries may develop if H(2)O(2) is swallowed and systemic air embolisms may occur due to the resultant gaseous oxygen. This study discusses a patient who was detected with the presence of gas in the portal venous system due to H(2)O(2) intoxication and was treated conservatively.

### An emergency department presentation of severe colitis after a Home hydrogen peroxide enema [^116YfDbd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Health information found on open access Internet platforms is often unscrutinized, unreliable, and can lead to considerable morbidity for patients and their presentation to the emergency department. Currently, home treatments for constipation and other gastrointestinal ailments featuring the use of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) enemas are readily available.

Case Report

We present a case of a 48-year-old female with a history of fibroids who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain after self-administering a 3% H 2 O 2 enema, which she learned about on the Internet as a treatment for constipation. She subsequently developed a severe colitis with evidence of pneumatosis and focal perforation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although toxicity from oral ingestions of H 2 O 2 is well described in the literature, there are few reports of the sequelae related to rectal administration. Due to its significant morbidity and the public health concerns related to this mechanism of toxicity, emergency physicians are at the frontlines for diagnosing and properly managing these patients. This case report reviews the patient's presentation, findings, and management.

### Rapid oxalate determination in blood and synthetic urine using a newly developed oxometer [^1159KyN9]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Blood and urine oxalate determinations have been limited to the laboratory setting because of complex sample storage and processing methods as well as the need for color spectrophotometry and ion chromatography. We hypothesized that glucometer test strips, impregnated with glucose oxidase and dyes that measure secondary hydrogen peroxide production, could be infused with oxalate oxidase and produce enhanced color changes in the presence of oxalate. By increasing the amount of sodium oxalate in fresh blood, we found that glucometer-measured oxalate increased on a linear scale. In addition, oxalate levels in synthetic urine could be measured using a visual scale, suggesting that strip dwell time or oxalate/oxalate oxidase concentrations could be manipulated to enhance optimal sensitivity. Although further testing is necessary, this simple, first-generation oxometer may eventually allow point of care testing in the home or office, empowering patients with oxalate-based medical conditions and giving healthcare providers real-time oxalate feedback.

### Chronic granulomatous disease: a large, single-center US experience [^116GGkkn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) was first described in 1957. By 1966, it was understood that this disease was because of an inability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to kill ingested bacteria and it was believed to be exclusively X-linked (XL); the diagnostic nitroblue tetrazolium test was first described a year later (reviewed in Ref.). The first cases of what were postulated to be autosomal recessive (AR) CGD were described a year after that in 1968. The disease is estimated to occur in approximately 1 of 100,000 to 1 of 200,000 births, – with the incidence differing among ethnic groups. Patients with CGD have defects in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which has membrane-associated (eg, gp91-phox and p22-phox) and cytosolic components (eg, p47-phox and p67-phox). The gp91-phox defect is inherited in an XL manner, whereas the p22-phox, p47-phox and p67-phox defects are inherited in an AR manner. The XL form is more severe, presents earlier and has a higher mortality.– Because of the defects in NADPH oxidase, phagocytes from patients with CGD are able to ingest pathogens but are unable to mount a respiratory burst of hydrogen peroxide and kill them. Catalase-positive bacteria and fungi such as staphylococci, Serratia, Burkholderia, and Aspergillus are particularly important pathogens in patients with CGD, because they express some catalase and thus can neutralize the small amounts of hydrogen peroxide that phagocytes produce by mechanisms other than NADPH oxidase.–

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for systemic gas embolism after hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^114NBYk3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly available product and its ingestion has been demonstrated to produce in vivo gas bubbles, which can embolize to devastating effect.

Objective

We report two cases of hydrogen peroxide ingestion with resultant gas embolization, one to the portal system and one cerebral embolus, which were successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), and review the literature.

Case Report

Two individuals presented to our center after unintentional ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions. Symptoms were consistent with portal gas emboli (Patient A) and cerebral gas emboli (Patient B), which were demonstrated on imaging. They were successfully treated with HBO and recovered without event.

Conclusions

As demonstrated by both our experience as well as the current literature, HBO has been used to successfully treat gas emboli associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion. We recommend consideration of HBO in any cases of significant hydrogen peroxide ingestion with a clinical picture compatible with gas emboli.

### Resolution of delayed altered mental status associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion following hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^114j4Gek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Case Report

An 82-year-old women presented with altered mental status, seizure, and apnea after an accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Ingestion of concentrated peroxide can result in gas embolism of the cerebral vasculature. After hyperbaric treatment, the patient had prompt and full neurologic recovery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of reversal of significant altered mental status associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion in temporal relation with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the dangers of peroxide ingestion and may wish to consider hyperbaric oxygen as a potential additional treatment for severe cases.

### Portal venous gas emboli after accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide [^117UzBiA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide is a common household product. It is clear and odorless making it easy to confuse with water, especially when improperly stored. Concentrated formulations are also available for consumer purchase.

Objective

We report a case of hydrogen peroxide ingestion in a child and discuss the potential consequences and treatment of such an exposure.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy accidentally ingested a sip of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. He rapidly developed hematemesis and presented to the Emergency Department. His initial work-up was unremarkable, and his symptoms resolved quickly. However, diffuse gas emboli were found within the portal system on abdominal computed tomography. The child was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and later found to have gastric irritation as well as an ulcer on endoscopy. He recovered fully from the incident.

Conclusions

We present this case to increase awareness of the dangers of hydrogen peroxide ingestion in children. Fortunately, the child in this case recovered fully, but emergency physicians should be aware of the potential consequences and therapeutic options.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^113Eq2pB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes. The lactose breath test is performed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may result from lactase deficiency. Lactose, which is exclusively found in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase is required for its digestion. Lactase deficiency can be primary or secondary (i.e. acquired lactase deficiency due to damage to, or absence, of the brush border). There is no gold standard test to diagnose lactose maldigestion and large scale data are lacking to compare the degree of agreement of the currently available tests. Jejunal biopsies followed by a lactase activity assay is invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution in the brush border. Genetic testing only detects primary lactase deficiency, and tests of blood glucose levels following lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not reliable. One other limitation of the lactose breath test is false negative results in individuals with fixed hydrogen and non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of breath tests. As mentioned above, false positive results can also occur.

### Treatment of portal venous gas embolism with hyperbaric oxygen after accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide: a case report and review of the literature [^114sopwM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known that hydrogen peroxide ingestion can cause gas embolism.

Objective

To report a case illustrating that the definitive, most effective treatment for gas embolism is hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Case Report

We present a case of a woman who presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain after an accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Complete recovery from her symptoms occurred quickly with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Conclusion

This is a case report of the successful use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat portal venous gas embolism caused by hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered for the treatment of symptomatic hydrogen peroxide ingestion.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^114NwBAF]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

As expected, higher cut-off levels (i.e. 25 ppm) decreased and lower cut-off levels (i.e. 15 ppm) increased the proportion of positive test results, especially for fructose HBT. However, with regard to the overall test performance and avoidance of borderline results, the cut-off definition at 20 ppm appears reasonable. The performance of different hydrogen breath tests at different cut-offs is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Performance of the hydrogen breath tests at different hydrogen cut-offs. Percentage of positive, negative and borderline hydrogen breath test results by three different hydrogen breath cut-offs as indicated. An increase in the production of hydrogen ≥ 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm and a two-fold increase of the individual baseline H 2 -exhalation in three consecutive breath samples was considered positive. Breath test, in which three hydrogen values were ≥ 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm but not all of those topped the baseline value by a two-fold increase or where hydrogen levels reached at least 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm but not at three time points were considered as borderline. All other test results were classified as being negative.

We analyzed hydrogen values of tests in which the ingested carbohydrate was absorbed without colonic fermentation and where no hydrogen was produced (negative test). Likewise, breath hydrogen concentrations obtained from patients who were unable to absorb all of the ingested carbohydrate were analyzed at baseline and at different time points after ingestion of the test meal (positive test). In these patients, bacterial fermentation resulted in the appearance of breath hydrogen that was below 20 ppm for the first 45 minutes (lactose), 30 minutes (fructose), or 60 minutes (sorbitol) and reached a maximum value by 90 minutes (lactose), 75 minutes (fructose), or 120 minutes (sorbitol). The maximum hydrogen produced represents peak carbohydrate fermentation. The time course analyses of breath hydrogen concentrations during breath tests using lactose, fructose, or sorbitol are summarized in Figure 2.

### Renal hydrogen peroxide production prevents salt-sensitive hypertension [^112TBUaa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, to our knowledge, we show for the first time: 1) the beneficial effect of physiological concentrations of prooxidants on blood pressure; 2) chronic reduction of the prooxidant, H 2 O 2, by overexpression of an antioxidant enzyme, catalase, increases blood pressure; and 3) the effects of H 2 O 2 on blood pressure are strain‐ and salt intake‐dependent. If studies in humans confirm these observations, then "excessive" intake of antioxidants may have deleterious effects on blood pressure regulation that may be observed only when salt intake is excessive, in genetically predisposed individuals.

Test performances at different cut-offs

A definitive positive test results with an increase in the production of hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm plus a two-fold increase of the individual baseline H 2 -exhalation in three breath samples was observed in 192 breath tests (fructose, n = 59; lactose, n = 31; sorbitol, n = 102). There were only 21 tests (5%) with a borderline result because the criteria for a positive result were only partially met. Reasons were: i) three hydrogen values ≥ 20 ppm but not all of those topped the baseline value by a two-fold increase (fructose, n = 1; lactose, n = 3; sorbitol, n = 3); or ii) hydrogen values reached ≥ 20 ppm, but not at three time points (fructose, n = 7; lactose, n = 3; sorbitol, n = 4). A baseline hydrogen value ≥ 10 ppm was noticed in 61 breath tests (fructose, n = 19; lactose, n = 26; sorbitol, n = 16) and test results were positive in 51% of these cases (fructose, n = 9; lactose, n = 9; sorbitol, n = 13). In total, 36 HBTs (8%) showed elevated baseline hydrogen levels (> 20 ppm) at 15–30 min after sugar ingestion (fructose, n = 20; lactose, n = 9, sorbitol, n = 7). In 118 patients, both fructose and sorbitol tests were performed. In 23 of these patients (20%), both tests were negative, and 39 patients (33%) had positive results in both tests. In the 56 patients (47%) with only one out of two positive tests, only 5 patients had an abnormal fructose breath test while 51 were diagnosed with sorbitol-intolerance. Testing for sorbitol may thus be meaningful, both in combination and independently.

### Hydrogen peroxide neurotoxicity in childhood: case report with unique magnetic resonance imaging features [^111oo4uB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) intoxication is relatively rare in children. Serious irreversible neurotoxicity generally results. The case of an 11-year-old boy who inadvertently drank a concentrated (35%) H2O2 solution is described. He exhibited signs of an acute encephalopathy with cortical visual impairment. Extensive cerebrocortical diffusion restriction with apparent gyral edema was evident at 3 days following ingestion, particularly in the parieto-occipital regions bilaterally. Spontaneous neurologic improvement quickly followed, and nearly full clinical resolution was evident 1 month later. The pattern of imaging abnormalities closely resembles that of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Concentrated H2O2 neurotoxicity in children can exhibit unique patterns (a reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy) and a better than expected outcome.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^116vpBFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

SIBO is a condition in which the small bowel is colonized by excessive numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microbes that are normally found in the large intestine. Aspiration of small bowel fluid, followed by culture and bacterial count is considered to be the current gold standard for diagnosis of SIBO. Unlike breath testing, small bowel aspiration is invasive, time-consuming and costly. In addition, small bowel aspiration has multiple shortcomings. Mid and distal segments of small bowel are beyond the reach of regular endoscopes; therefore, proximal small bowel aspirates may be falsely negative. Although aseptic techniques for small bowel aspirates have been described, contamination with oral and esophageal flora may lead to a significant number of false positive results. Quantitative PCR studies have been used to diagnose SIBO with promising results; however, such techniques are not readily available for clinical practice.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^1158nhnK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide poisoning is a rare but potentially severe poisoning that can cause digestive tract irritation and/or gas embolism when ingested. The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic patients to severe embolic consequences or even death. There is little evidence on the treatment of such poisoning to guide physicians in caring for these patients. This paper reports on two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning after accidental ingestion. Both patients showed evidence of portal venous gas, with one patient exhibiting significant symptoms while the other did not. Both were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), with a follow-up CT scan revealing a complete resolution of the portal venous gas. This suggests that HBOT is effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with portal venous gas and should be considered as an effective treatment option in cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning.

### Timing of embolic phenomena after hydrogen peroxide exposure-a systematic review [^111cCBB8]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide ingestions cause significant morbidity and mortality due to oxygen gas emboli and are treatable with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Recommendations for observation are based on small case series.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review is to define the time of onset of embolic phenomena after hydrogen peroxide exposure and to describe the proportion of patients who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Methods

Cases from a systematic literature search were combined with those from a prior study that used data derived from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. Air-gas emboli were defined as embolic phenomena (stroke, myocardial infarction, obstructive shock) potentially reversed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Simple counts, mean, and interquartile range were used for description and comparisons.

Results

A total of 766 records were identified in the literature search. Three-hundred and eighty-three duplicate records were identified and removed. Of the 383 remaining records, 156 met inclusion criteria; 88 were excluded based on predetermined criteria yielding 68 records with 85 unique cases. Forty-one cases were extracted from the 2017 National Poison Data System study resulting in a total of 126 cases for analysis. Case descriptions: We analyzed these 126 cases and documented 213 discrete clinical events, excluding deaths. There were 108 high-concentration exposures, 10 low-concentration exposures, and 8 were unknown. Thirty-five cases were intentional ingestions but not for self-harm, and 84 were unintentional or accidental. Only 4 cases were for self-harm, and there were 23 pediatric cases. There were 99 air-gas emboli reported in 78 patients. Time to onset: The time to onset of air-gas embolic was documented in 70/78. Time to symptom onset ranged from immediate to 72h after hydrogen peroxide exposure. Over 90% of embolic symptoms occurred within 10h of ingestion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: A total of 54/126 cases received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of those 54 cases, 31 had primary portal venous gas while the remaining 23 had air-gas emboli. Of the 23 air-gas emboli cases treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 13 made full recoveries while 10 had residual symptoms or died. Mean time from air-gas emboli symptom onset to hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the full recovery group was 9h compared to 18.2h in the partial recovery/death group. Portal venous gas: There were 63 total reported cases of portal venous gas. Forty-nine of these cases were primary portal venous gas, 13 were secondary findings in patients with air-gas emboli and one case was secondary to non-air-gas emboli symptoms. Twenty-seven of 49 patients with portal venous gas (55%) as the primary finding had gastrointestinal bleeding. Thirty of the 63 cases received hyperbaric oxygen therapy for portal venous gas without any documented air-gas emboli. Deaths: Seventeen deaths occurred in the combined cohort. Of these, 13 were associated with high-concentration exposures. All deaths with reported time to symptom onset had symptoms within 1h of exposure.

Conclusion

This review of hydrogen peroxide exposure cases suggests that clinically significant embolic phenomena occur within 10h of exposure, although delayed air-gas emboli do happen and should considered when deciding duration of observation. It remains equivocal whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is beneficial in cases of primary portal venous gas without systemic involvement.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^1171TKKy]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

Two male patients in their late 70s were admitted to the local emergency department after ingesting a sip of an unknown, odourless, viscous liquid that they believed to be white wine. Within 30 min of ingestion, they experienced gastric symptoms (Patient A: nausea, followed by abdominal pain and haematemesis; Patient B: nausea and epigastric discomfort).

Admitted to the emergency department (75 min after ingestion), they were both haemodynamically stable, and the clinical examination, particularly neurological, was unremarkable. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm without other abnormalities. For Patient A, all standard biological tests, including blood count, renal function, hepatic function and electrolytes, were within normal limits. In contrast, Patient B had elevated troponin-T level without kinetic change (troponin-T, high sensitivity (normal < 14 ng/L)): 33 ng/L (2 hours after poisoning) and 33 ng/L (4 hours after poisoning). Given the absence of both anamnesis and clinical findings indicating excessive alcohol consumption and with both patients and witnesses reporting that they had only taken a single sip from that unknown bottle at that time, blood alcohol concentration was not measured.

Patient A developed somnolence 5 hours post-intoxication and showed objective confusion 6 hours after the incident (GCS 13/15). His wife reported that he began displaying unusual behaviour (difficulty to communicate with) immediately after ingestion. This prompted a cerebral and thoracoabdominopelvic CT, which showed the presence of a significant amount of gas in the venous portal system and a thickening of the oesophageal and gastric walls. There was no evidence of arterial gas embolism on imaging.

Patient B only experienced epigastric discomfort and mild nausea without further symptoms. He underwent gastroscopy, which revealed massive inflammation and erythematous-haemorrhagic mucosa throughout the entire stomach, with no damage to the oesophagus or duodenum (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Gastroscopy was performed on Patient B, revealing signs of diffuse haemorrhagic gastritis. The abdominal CT scans of Patients A and B before and after hyperbaric therapy are presented. Images A and B show portal gas embolism discovered during initial CT. Images A' and B' show radiological resolution of the embolism following a single hyperbaric therapy (26 hours after poisoning, 9 hours after hyperbaric therapy).

### Modern concepts of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^111YpNXY]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the 1980s, hydrogen breath testing became popularized as a means of diagnosing SIBO. Various substrates were used in this test. In the end, the two principal substrates that remain are glucose and lactulose. The principle of hydrogen breath testing is that when an ingested carbohydrate traverses the gut and is encountered by bacteria they will ferment it, producing gases which are then absorbed detected on the breath. In the 1990s, methane was added to breath testing. However, it was unclear what the role of methane was. What was known is that human cells do not produce hydrogen or methane, suggesting that the presence of these gases on the breath test had to result from gut microbial sources.

Over the decades as breath testing became more commonly used, some have pointed back to culture as the gold standard. We now know that traditional culture was not a good "gold standard" for a number of reasons, particularly as catheters were not improved to prevent contamination. A recent study from the Mayo Clinic reported that approximately 20% of cultures from the small bowel were contaminated. This level of uncertainty cannot be a gold standard. With this in mind, modern catheters have been developed that are sterile double lumen catheters, improving the certainty that the aspirates obtained truly represent the small intestine (Table 1). In addition, capsule based technologies, while still nascent, offer hope for further alternatives to older inaccurate techniques.

More recently, breath testing has further advanced with the addition of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). In fact, H 2 S completes the three gases that can be detected on breath test and are produced by the gut microbiome. As we will discuss further later, hydrogen may be the least interesting of these gases. With our more modern understanding of microbial overgrowth, we now know that methane is associated with constipation and hydrogen sulfide, linked in early studies to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is associated with diarrhea. These have now been compared to next generation sequencing results from patients, which confirm that the levels of these gases seen on the breath test are an indicator of the degree of colonization of the gut, including the small bowel, with organisms that produce these gases (Table 1). In addition, data continue to accumulate that these three gases are in fact associated with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^111nS4Q2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

What are the possible etiologies and how do they affect the clinical presentation and the therapeutic options?

Strong acids and alkalis are responsible for most severe caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract. Identification of the nature, the physical form, and the quantity of the ingested agent as well as the accidental-voluntary ingestion pattern are the cornerstones for emergency management of corrosive injuries (Grade 2A). Contacting Poison Control Centers to evaluate systemic toxicity of the ingested agents is recommended (Grade 2B). In case of massive ingestion, both acids and alkalis may induce extensive necrosis of the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidants (bleach) usually cause mild injuries but severe damage requiring emergency resection has been occasionally reported. Ingestion of ammonia results in superficial hemorrhagic gastritis which may progress during the first 24–48 h and requires specific surveillance. The quantity of ingested corrosive agent is related to the accidental/voluntary pattern of ingestion; this is the most important prognostic factor although reliable information is usually lacking. The physical form of the ingested substance is another major determinant of the damage pattern to the gastrointestinal tract. Solids produce maximum damage to the mouth and the pharynx, while liquids transit rapidly and induce burns of the esophagus and the stomach; concomitant vapor aspiration (ammonia, formaldehyde) may cause airway burns. Caregivers should be aware that specific corrosives may also cause severe systemic effects such as hypocalcemia (phosphoric, hydrofluoric acids), hyponatremia (strong acids/alkalis), hypokalemia, and acidosis.

What are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations?

Initial laboratory evaluation of caustic injuries should include CBC, serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium, urea creatinine, liver tests (bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), pH and serum lactate, blood alcohol levels, and measurement of β-HCG in young women (Grade 2A). Laboratory and imaging findings have an important role in identifying patients with transmural necrosis who might benefit from emergency surgical treatment. As initial normal laboratory values do not rule out transmural necrosis, kinetics of laboratory data is useful in patient monitoring and management. Abnormal values such as severe acidosis (low pH, high blood lactate levels), deranged liver function tests, leukocytosis, elevated CRP level, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia are predictive of transmural necrosis and poor outcomes.

### Outcomes after high-concentration peroxide ingestions [^115YSWoS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

In cases of high-concentration peroxide ingestion reported to US poison centers, we describe medical outcomes, examine the role of hyperbaric oxygen, and review the use of endoscopy.

Methods

The study was a retrospective analysis of a structured database, the National Poison Data System. The chart for each poison center case of a high-concentration (> 10%) peroxide ingestion was obtained and abstracted in a standardized fashion; 1,054 cases were initially considered and 294 cases met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome of possible embolic event was defined as seizure, altered mental status, respiratory distress, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, ECG changes, radiographic evidence of cerebrovascular accident, focal neurologic deficit on examination, pulmonary embolism, cardiac emboli, elevated troponin level, physician bedside diagnosis, or rapid improvement after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Both descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data.

Results

In the 10-year study period, 41 of 294 patients (13.9%; 95% confidence interval 10.2% to 18.4%) with symptoms after high-concentration peroxide ingestion demonstrated evidence of embolic events, and 20 of 294 (6.8%; 95% confidence interval 4.2% to 10.3%) either died or exhibited continued disability when the poison center chart was closed. Improved outcomes were demonstrated after early hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Endoscopy revealed grade 3 or 4 lesions in only 5 cases.

Conclusion

Symptomatic high-concentration peroxide exposures had a high incidence of associated embolic events in this cohort. Patients with evidence of embolic events had a high rate of death. Early hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful, but routine endoscopy is unlikely to be of benefit.

### Caustic ingestion in adults: the role of endoscopic classification in predicting outcome [^116RSaiD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study confirm Zargar's endoscopic classification of mucosal injuries post caustic ingestion in relation to clinical outcome. Grade 3b mucosal injury assessed by EGD was a predictor of prolonged duration of hospital stay, ICU admittance, and GI and systematic complications. Over 80% of patients with grade 3 burns develop stricture formation, while one-third of those with grade 2 develop pyloric stenosis, acid regurgitation, and perforation. In our data, only 50% of patients with grade 3 burns developed stricture formation, while 10% of those with grade 2 developed GI complication. Our lower results may be because of the development and use of more effective anti-acid medications (proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists) and more aggressive use of nasogastric irrigation to reduced effect of the substance ingested. The primary reason for ingestion in our patient population was suicidal intent (71%); thus, the injury produced was generally greater and more extensive than that in individuals who ingest caustic substances out of curiosity or by accident.

Caustic ingestion typically refers to the ingestion of strongly alkaline or acidic household or industrial cleaning products. Alkalis can be found in drain openers, bleaches, toilet bowl cleaners, and detergents containing hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide at concentrations from 4% to 54%. Solid alkaline variants such as crystals or particles adhere to the mucous membrane and increase esophageal injury as a result of prolonged contact with the mucosa. Acid ingestion, which tends to occur less frequently in Western countries (< 5%), is more common in countries like Taiwan where hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid (found in toilet bowl cleaners, antirust compounds, battery fluids, and commercial pesticides) are readily accessible.

Earlier studies have questioned the recommendation of routine endoscopic evaluation of all patients after presumed caustic ingestion on the basis that in the absence of symptoms following unintentional ingestion severe injury is unlikely. The tensile strength of healing tissues in the first 3 weeks is low due to an absence of collagen. New collagen formation does not begin until the second week after injury. Thus, it is advocated that endoscopy should be avoided from 5 to 15 days after caustic ingestion. Currently, EGD evaluation within 12 hours and no later than 24 hours after caustic ingestion is considered safe, and may be beneficial up to 96 hours after ingestion. EGD is not recommended from 2 to 3 days up to 2 weeks after caustic ingestion as a result of wound softening.

13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ESKATA or hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrogen peroxide has been found to exhibit positive results in in vitro tests for genotoxicity, but has not exhibited positive results in in vivo tests for genotoxicity, presumably due to the rapid metabolism of hydrogen peroxide.

The effects of hydrogen peroxide on fertility have not been evaluated. Hydrogen peroxide has been associated with effects on sperm function and elevated testicular hydrogen peroxide concentration has been implicated in male infertility, although in vivo, no effect of hydrogen peroxide on sperm function has been demonstrated.

### Severe acute haemorrhagic gastritis controlled by hydrogen peroxide [^111qDoLi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with severe acute haemorrhagic gastritis due to abuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She was treated with instillation of 150 mL 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) every 2 h via a nasogastric tube. The copious amount of bright red blood through the nasogastric tube started to decline substantially after the first administration of H2O2 and continued to reveal clear material during the second and third instillation of H2O2. The total amount of H2O2 administered was 600 ml. No rebleeding and only a few flame-shaped intramucosal haemorrhages were observed on the following four consecutive daily endoscopic evaluations. These are promising observations which will have to be confirmed with respect to the safety and efficacy of H2O2 treatment by further controlled studies.

### A novel copper-hydrogen peroxide formulation for prion decontamination [^112NyVup]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

With the appearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the detection of infectious prions in the peripheral organs of persons with sporadic CJD, the development of decontamination methods that are compatible with medical equipment has become a major issue. Here, we show that a formulation of copper metal ions in combination with hydrogen peroxide dramatically reduces the level of prion protein (PrP)(Sc) (the scrapie isoform of PrP) present in homogenates of samples from prion-infected brains, including brain samples from humans with CJD. An animal bioassay confirmed the reduction in prion infectivity, indicating that this novel Cu(2+)-H(2)O(2) formulation has great potential for prion decontamination.

### Lactose intolerance [^116yTEme]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose because of a genetically inadequate amount of the enzyme lactase. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 15 percent of persons of northern European descent, up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 12 oz of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake.

### Hydrogen peroxide ingestion associated with portal venous gas and treatment with hyperbaric oxygen: a case series and review of the literature [^113ySL9i]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) has been associated with venous and arterial gas embolic events, hemorrhagic gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, and death. Although H(2)O(2) is generally considered a benign ingestion in low concentrations, case reports have described serious toxicity following high concentration exposures. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been used with success in managing patients suffering from gas embolism with and without manifestations of ischemia.

Methods

Poison center records were searched from July 1999 to January 2010 for patients with H(2)O(2) exposure and HBO treatment. Cases were reviewed for the concentration of H(2)O(2), symptoms, CT scan findings of portal gas embolism, HBO treatment, and outcome. RESULTS; Eleven cases of portal gas embolism were found. Ages ranged from 4 to 89 years. All but one ingestion was accidental in nature. In 10 cases 35% H(2)O(2) was ingested and in 1 case 12% H(2)O(2) was ingested. All abdominal CT scans demonstrated portal venous gas embolism in all cases. Hyperbaric treatment was successful in completely resolving all portal venous gas bubbles in nine patients (80%) and nearly resolving them in two others. Ten patients were able to be discharged home within 1 day, and one patient had a 3.5-day length of stay.

Conclusions

HBO was successful in resolving portal venous gas embolism from accidental concentrated H(2)O(2) ingestions.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^11297qob]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breath test (BT) is performed to aid in the diagnosis of many common gastroenterological conditions including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, carbohydrate maldigestion and dysfunction or alterations in oro-cecal transit. Presently in clinical practice, BT is being performed with various substrates (e.g. glucose, lactulose, fructose, sorbitol, sucrose and inulin) using variable doses for a range of established and unestablished indications (e.g. SIBO, orocecal-transit time assessment and carbohydrate maldigestion). The number of BTs being ordered by health care professionals is rising (including the use of mail order breath tests), but the lack of standardization regarding the indications, preparation and performance and interpretation of BT has led to considerable heterogeneity between different centers and practitioners. In addition, research gaps are widening due to inter-study variability in methodology. A systematic review found 13 case-control studies that used breath testing to diagnose SIBO. Detailed examination of these studies reveals that they used 13 different methodologies to conduct the breath test or interpret the results.

BT relies on measurement of gases produced in the intestine which diffuse into the systemic circulation and are expired through the lungs. There are 4 main sources for intestinal gases: swallowed air and air mixed with food, chemical reactions in the gut, diffusion of gases from the blood stream, and microbial metabolism. Healthy subjects have an average of about 100 mL of intestinal gas (ranging from 30 to 200 ml), principally composed of hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), with lesser amounts of oxygen (O 2), nitrogen (N 2), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), indole, skatole and ammonia (NH 3). Of these, H 2 and CH 4 are exclusively produced via microbial fermentation in the gut, which is the principle behind clinical breath testing. Gut microbes readily digest carbohydrates, resulting in production of these gases, which then diffuse into the abdominal venous circulation and are transported to the lungs, where they can be detected in the exhaled breath.

For decades, water-mill murmur, decrease in end-tidal CO(2) (Petco(2)), hypotension, and hypoxemia have been accepted as diagnostic criteria for gas embolism. In this case report, a 19-yr-old male patient developed a sudden reduction in Petco(2) and profound circulatory collapse 15 min after intramedullary irrigation with H(2)O(2). However, arterial oxygen desaturation never developed throughout the entire course of resuscitation from presumed massive oxygen embolism.

### ASPEN definitions in pediatric intestinal failure [^1153VFZW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in children — definition, diagnostic thresholds, and testing performance are summarized as follows: Risk factors that may predispose children to SIBO include the use of acid-suppressive therapies and alterations in GI motility and anatomy. In a review, 249 articles were assessed and 101 defined SIBO either by breath test or duodenal aspirate culture yield; the most common definitions included > 105 CFU/mL in jejunal aspirate fluid and a dual H2 peak or > 20 ppm increase in breath hydrogen. A detailed definition states SIBO is an excess of bacteria > 10^5 CFU/mL in duodenojejunal aspirate fluid (10^3 CFU/mL if colonic-type species are present) or diagnosis by glucose or lactulose hydrogen breath test with either a double peak or a peak of > 20 ppm hydrogen above basal within 90 min of lactulose ingestion. For breath testing, reported performance is a sensitivity of 60%–90% and a specificity of 85%. Practical considerations include that aspiration and direct culturing are limited by cost, invasiveness, and contamination risk, and in children with SBS, rapid transit time may further impact breath test interpretation. Severe SIBO may be accompanied by vitamin B12 deficiencies, and elevations in methylmalonic acid may serve as a surrogate marker. The remaining 18 articles used symptoms or simply increased bacterial content without details.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^113wrYN6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is an odourless, colourless chemical compound, slightly more viscous than water, used in many fields due to its oxidising properties. At low concentrations (3%), it is used as a cosmetic product (hair bleaching solution), surface disinfectant and medical disinfectant. In higher concentrations (25% or higher), it has industrial uses, notably paper production, textile manufacturing and in the food industry.

Hydrogen peroxide poisoning is rarebut can lead to serious or even lethal consequences. Some patients may require hospitalisation, become permanently disabled or die. The lethal risk increases considerably when intoxication occurs at concentrations of more than 10%.

We report the case of two patients who accidentally ingested highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide (approximately 100%). The patients had complications related to the presence of portal venous gas and were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), leading to a complete resolution of portal venous gas. This illustrates the variability in clinical presentation: although both patients exhibited digestive symptoms, one developed cardiac complications, while the other experienced neurological symptoms, despite ingesting the same hydrogen peroxide solution at the same time.

We present this report with adherence to CARE (Case Report) case report guidelines. We obtained signed informed consent to publish this case report from the two patients.

### Accidental concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion associated with portal venous gas [^111XBejg]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A case of a 52-year old male patient who presented to the emergency department with severe nausea and vomiting following accidental ingestion of H2O2. A computed tomography (CT) abdomen performed at our institution demonstrated extensive portal venous gas throughout the liver with few gas droplets seen in the extrahepatic portal vein portion. Pneumatosis was also noted in the wall of the gastric antrum. Upper GI Endoscopy was done revealing diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis and mild duodenal bulb erosion. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen. On the second day of admission, the patient was able to eat without difficulty or pain. Accidental ingestion of high concentration H2O2 solution has been shown to cause extensive injury to surrounding tissues. The injury occurs via three main mechanisms: corrosive damage, oxygen gas formation, and lipid peroxidation. We report a case of accidental ingestion of a highly concentrated (35%) solution of H2O2 causing portal venous gas.

### Does a glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test detect bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum? [^115TGHER]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Direct diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) requires the collection and culture of fluid from the jejunal lumen, with a finding of over 10 5 viable bacteria per mL. More often, SIBO is diagnosed indirectly, using a non-invasive test of the exhaled hydrogen and methane generated by microbial fermentation when ingested glucose reaches the jejunum. Our objective was to determine how well this breath test detects chronic overgrowth of jejunal bacteria that is unrelated to gastrointestinal surgery.

Methods

Eighteen patients reporting symptoms consistent with SIBO received a glucose breath test. On a later day, the jejunal lumen was sampled via aspiration during enteroscopy. Jejunal aspirates were cultured on aerobic and anaerobic media. DNA was extracted from the same samples and analyzed by quantitative pan-bacterial PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal rRNA genes, which provided a culture-independent bacterial cell count.

Key Results

Combined bacterial colony counts ranged from 5.7 x 10 3 to 7.9 x 10 6 CFU/mL. DNA-based yields ranged from 1.5 x 10 5 to 3.1 x 10 7 bacterial genomes per mL. Microbial viability ranged from 0.3% to near 100%. We found no significant correlation of glucose breath test results with either the number of bacterial colonies or with the DNA-based bacterial cell counts. Instead, higher signals in the hydrogen-methane breath test were significantly correlated with a lower viability of jejunal bacteria, at a P-value of .014.

Conclusions & Inferences

The glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test is not sensitive to the overgrowth of jejunal bacteria. However, a positive breath test may indicate altered jejunal function and microbial dysbiosis.

### Hydrogen peroxide and cutaneous biology: translational applications, benefits, and risks [^114PfB3P]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is an endogenous reactive oxygen species that contributes to oxidative stress directly as a molecular oxidant and indirectly through free radical generation. Topically applied 1% to 45% H 2 O 2 can be used for a range of clinical purposes, which will be reviewed here in addition to its safety. In concentrations from 1% to 6%, H 2 O 2 has antimicrobial properties and can act as a debriding agent through its effervescence, making low-concentration H 2 O 2 useful for wound care. H 2 O 2 has also been shown to promote venous insufficiency ulcer healing, but studies in other wound types are needed. In 1% formulations, H 2 O 2 is used outside the United States to treat acne and has shown efficacy similar to or greater than benzoyl peroxide, with reduced side effects. In a concentration of 40%, H 2 O 2 is US Food and Drug Administration-approved to treat seborrheic keratoses and may cause fewer pigmentary changes than cryotherapy, although elimination often requires 2 to 4 treatments. However, H 2 O 2 should be used with caution, as exposure can cause adverse effects through its oxidant capabilities. Low H 2 O 2 concentrations cause only transient symptoms (blanching and blistering), but exposure to 9% to 45% H 2 O 2 can cause more severe skin damage, including epidermal necrosis leading to erythema and bullae. Overall, H 2 O 2 has numerous therapeutic uses, and novel indications, such as treating actinic keratoses and skin cancers, continue to be explored.

### Corneal and conjunctival toxicity from hydrogen peroxide: a patient with chronic self-induced injury [^111FpoH8]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a patient with severe corneal and conjunctival toxicity from long-term, habitual use of hydrogen peroxide as an eye wash.

Design

Observational case report.

Intervention and Testing

Serial examinations of the cornea, conjunctiva, and ocular adnexa were done. Penetrating keratoplasty with amniotic membrane transplantation was performed.

Main Outcome Measures

Ocular inflammation, pain, and visual acuity outcome.

Results

Bilateral corneal and conjunctival inflammation and scarring mimicking ocular-cicatricial pemphigoid were noted. Formation of a descemetocele after starting treatment with low-dose topical steroids required emergent penetrating keratoplasty with amniotic membrane transplantation.

Conclusions

This is the first reported case of ocular surface toxicity in a patient after deliberate chronic use of high-dose hydrogen peroxide. It highlights the value of obtaining a thorough medical and social history and the importance of direct questioning about the use of any medications or agents on the eyes before making a diagnosis or initiating therapy.

5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Eye Disorders: Avoid eye exposure. Eye disorders including corneal injury (erosion, ulceration, perforation, and scarring), chemical conjunctivitis, eyelid edema, severe eye pain, or permanent eye injury, including blindness can occur after exposure. If accidental exposure occurs, flush eyes with water for 15 to 30 minutes and initiate monitoring, and further evaluation as appropriate. (5.1)
Local Skin Reactions: severe reactions, including ulcerations and scarring, may occur. Do not retreat with ESKATA until the skin has recovered from any reaction caused by the previous treatment (5.2)

5.1	Eye Disorders

Do not apply to the eyes or mucous membranes. Avoid treating seborrheic keratoses within the orbital rim. Direct contact with the eye can cause corneal injury (erosion, ulceration, perforation, and scarring), chemical conjunctivitis, eyelid edema, severe eye pain, or permanent eye injury, including blindness.

If accidental exposure occurs, flush with water for 15 to 30 minutes and initiate monitoring, and further evaluation as appropriate.

5.2	Local Skin Reactions

Skin reactions occurred in the treatment area after application of ESKATA. Severe local skin reactions included erosion, ulceration, vesiculation and scarring. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate a second treatment course with ESKATA until the skin has recovered from any reaction caused by the previous treatment.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^115LQ5FY]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

It has been shown that malabsorption of lactose, fructose and/or sorbitol has a similar frequency in patients with IBS than in healthy subjects. Importantly, it has also been shown that in IBS patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO), sugar breath tests may be falsely abnormal. An abnormal lactulose HBT was found in children with functional gastrointestinal symptoms and additional investigation has been suggested to rule out the underlying cause (e.g. accelerated intestinal transit or SBBO). However, we did not systematically screen included patients for SBBO and we excluded patients with an already established diagnosis of SBBO. Furthermore, included patients underwent HBT on the background of chronic/recurrent abdominal pain and included patients did not have an established diagnosis of IBS. It would be worthwhile to investigate the link between IBS, SBBO and HBT in future studies in more detail. However, this was beyond the scope of our present study. It will also be important in future studies with a blinded and controlled design to determine how symptoms should be assessed during the test and to what extent these are reliable. Further studies are also needed to address research goals with regard to fructose intolerance, standardisation of symptom assessment during the test and long-term follow up, and sequential reintroduction of sugars in multiple sugar malabsorption. Furthermore, new analytical methods with a semi-quantitative interpretation of breath tests might provide a broader understanding of breath test outcomes. Nevertheless, we imposed dietary restrictions only in patients with positive breath test results despite the finding that patients with negative breath test results reported symptoms after carbohydrate ingestion. We did this because of the unreliability of symptom reporting previously shown during carbohydrate malabsorption studies and the high reliability of hydrogen breath testing to detect incomplete carbohydrate digestion.

### Sodium nitrite [^113BXomK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer Sodium Nitrite Injection without delay.
Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions. Administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies. Airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, and oxygen administration should not be delayed in order to administer sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The expert advice of a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1–800–222–1222.

Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning

Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside\.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Sodium Nitrite Injection, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^115apy74]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Prokinetic drugs such as tegaserod and other laxatives such as magnesium compounds can also affect the composition of the breath gases. Faster transit time caused by promotility drugs will lead to an earlier delivery of the substrate to colon and will increase the chance of a false positive result. Again, no clear data exist, but a 4-week gap between cessation of prokinetics and breath testing has previously been recommended. However, a 4-week gap may not be practical in patients with constipation or gastroparesis; hence, we propose discontinuing laxatives and promotility agents for a week and only if tolerated by patients.

A low fasting level of breath H 2 is essential for interpreting the breath test results, as these are directly affected by consumption of fermentable complex carbohydrates. As a result, avoidance of complex carbohydrates and dairy products the evening or day before a breath test (meat and rice do not appear to affect the breath test) and overnight fasting is also recommended, although the precise duration requires to be determined in future studies.

Smoking affects breath test results by increasing exhaled H 2 and CO 2 content of the exhaled breath and should be avoided on the day of the test. Smoking also increases gastric transit time. As hyperventilation inversely affects H 2 levels, excessive physical activity should be avoided during the breath test. Conflicting results exist in the literature in regards to the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on breath test results. Stopping PPIs may not lead to more accurate measurements of exhaled breath gas levels and recurrence of reflux symptoms may not be tolerable to all patients. Currently, stopping anti-acid medications prior to breath testing is not necessary.

Indications for breath testing

Current small bowel culture techniques are not satisfactory for the assessment of SIBO.
If culture is considered for diagnosis of SIBO, based on the current evidence, we suggest the threshold of > 10 3 c.f.u./ml for the definition of SIBO.
We suggest breath testing in the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
Until a true gold standard is established, we suggest breath testing in assessing the presence of antibiotic-responsive microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.
We suggest to evaluate for excessive methane excretion on breath test in association with clinical constipation and slowing of gastrointestinal transit.
We suggest that breath testing should not be used for assessment of orocecal transit time.
We suggest breath testing for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes.
We suggest breath testing in the assessment of conditions associated with bloating.

### The role of age in predicting the outcome of caustic ingestion in adults: a retrospective analysis [^111U8Uws]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Immediate management

Blood tests, including complete blood and differential counts, and measurements of alanine transaminase, creatinine, Na +, and K + were performed in the ER. Based on the judgment of the ER physician in charge, patients were treated with a proton pump inhibitor, H 2 antagonist, or sucralfate gel. Oral intake was withheld and parenteral nutrition was provided until evidence was obtained that the condition of the patient had stabilized. Antibiotics were not administered routinely due to national healthcare insurance restrictions. If infection was suspected, empirical antimicrobial therapies (such as a first generation cephalosporin and/or gentamicin or ciprofloxacin) were administered until blood cultures were obtained. If a pulmonary or respiratory complication was suspected, a chest X-ray was performed. Aspiration pneumonia was defined as a lung infection developing after accidental inhalation of foods, liquids, or stomach contents and was diagnosed by chest X-ray; patient history served to confirm that no other form of lung disease was present.

Further management

If the patient's condition became unstable or respiratory difficulty was encountered, he/she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation. After discharge, each surviving patient was followed at the outpatient clinic for at least 1 month. If the patient had symptoms of dysphagia during follow-up, an upper GI series or EGD was performed to confirm the presence of stricture. Patients with GI or systemic complications were followed until these patients expired. Those with persistent dilatation were followed for over 7 years. The overall range of follow-up times, therefore, was 3 days to more than 7 years.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112nA6Sn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — key considerations emphasize that pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red, and this flushing should not be interpreted as an allergic reaction. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas, and clinicians should be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available in commercial kits.

If difficult product identification try to evaluate pH (< 2; > 10), but be aware that some agents cause a pH-independent corrosive injury. (Level 4–5)
Evaluate the ingestion scenario by: a) ascertain ingestion; b) determine the accidental or voluntary character; c) detect co-ingestion of alcohol and/or drugs; d) try to evaluate ingested quantity (in adults assess normal sip (30–50 ml) vs. large gulp (60–90 ml); e) assess delay from ingestion. (Level 4–5)
Identification of additional risk factors such as extreme ages (young children, elderly), pregnancy, underlying disease, and the form of the ingested agent (solid, liquid, gel, vapors-concomitant aspiration). (Level 5)
Supportive care rather than specific antidotes is the mainstay of treatment. Secure airway patency and hemodynamic stabilization. Prevent vomiting, repeat esophageal passage, and aspiration by: a) use of antiemetics (metoclopramide); b) seated 45° position during transport; c) avoid gastric lavage and induced emesis; d) avoid diluents (milk, water). (Level 5)
Avoid increasing damage by exothermic reaction: attempts at pH neutralization with either a weak alkali or acid are prohibited. (Level 5)

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^116CRMc4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Clinical manifestations of hydrogen peroxide poisoning depend on the volume, concentration and type of exposure: ocular exposure causes irritation, blurred vision and subepithelial and conjunctival bullae at concentrations of 3%, ulcerationand even perforation of the cornea in concentrations above 10%. Chemical colitis in the case of hydrogen peroxide enemaand respiratory tract damage in the case of inhalation have been described.

The toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide poisoning are caused by three main mechanisms: direct irritation of tissues by the formation of corrosive lesions, lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes and the formation of oxygen. This latter effect is due to a reaction (2H 2 O 2 → 2H 2 O + O 2) mediated by an endogenous catalase, found in mucous membranes, liver, kidneys, erythrocytes and bone marrow. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide creates digestive tract irritation immediately after ingestion. Then, after absorption in the portal system, hydrogen peroxide produces an important volume of oxygen that can lead to the presence of a large amount of gas in the portal vein and potentially in the general circulation. It has been shown that 30 mL of 35% hydrogen peroxide can form up to 3.5 L of oxygen.

Most exposures occur through ingestion. This causes caustic lesions of the digestive mucosa, as well as the formation of gas bubbles responsible for pneumatosis of the digestive walls, portal venous gas, strokeand ischaemic coronary events. Most clinically significant systemic embolic phenomena occur within 10 hours but may also be delayed.

Both the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society in the United States and the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine have approved HBOT for gas embolism. HBOT consists of breathing 100% oxygen at a higher pressure than sea level. Due to the Boyle-Mariotte law, increased pressure results in decreased size of enclosed gas spaces, including bubbles in gas embolism situations, therefore restoring downstream blood flow. HBOT has been shown to reduce the risk of sequelae and mortality, particularly in the case of neurological or cardiac symptoms, or the presence of peripheral embolisation. Cases presenting with the presence of venous gas (eg, in portal vein) alone have also been successfully treated conservatively.

Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of NITHIODOTE, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

### Laboratory-acquired brucellosis [^117HWJeK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

No evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. other than through occupational exposure, was identified for either laboratory worker. They denied traveling outside of the United States, consuming imported or domestic unpasteurized dairy products, knowing ill family or friends who may have traveled, attending events with potentially contaminated foods, or handling farm or laboratory animals. Both laboratory workers denied any accidental contamination or spills in the laboratory during the 6 months before their respective illnesses. Site visits to laboratories 1 and 2 were conducted by NYSDOH. On the open bench at laboratory 1, blood cultures were routinely subcultured onto agar. A syringe was used to directly plate contents of the blood culture media bottle onto agar. A Gram stain was then performed with additional contents from the syringe. The stain was fixed in an incubator. Subsequent biochemical tests, including a catalase test, which may generate aerosols by introducing hydrogen peroxide to the specimen, were performed on the open laboratory bench. At laboratory 2, subculturing occurred in a similar manner, but it took place in a class II biosafety cabinet. However, biochemical tests were performed on the open laboratory bench when Gram stain results indicated that spores were not present. Laboratory workers 1 and 2 wore gloves when processing specimens, and both denied having dermatitis or skin lesions on their hands.

### Photo quiz: unusual phenotypic and lancefield group testing in blood culture isolate [^112vMPUa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

PHOTO QUIZ

A 55-year-old patient with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease presents with malaise and fever for approximately 1 week. On physical examination, he was found to have a painful lower extremity, and non-healing ulcer present for approximately a month. The ulcer is 3.0 cm in diameter and ulcerated with a hyperemic border. He has two dogs and a pet fish. No significant travel or vocational history is noted. Blood cultures are collected and submitted to the microbiology laboratory. Growth was detected in the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles after 16-hour incubation. A representative Gram stain of the blood cultures is pictured (Fig. 1A). Subcultured colonies were visible on the sheep blood agar (Fig. 1B: 48-hour incubation); there was no growth on MacConkey agar. Bubbles formed when the colony was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1C). Latex agglutination testing with the Lancefield group B reagent produced a weak reaction showing fine clumping (Fig. 1D). The VEREGENE System (Luminex) Gram-positive panel was negative. What is the diagnosis?

### Postprandial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of extra virgin olive oil [^112SfKQs]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

High postprandial serum lipid concentrations are associated with increased oxidative stress which, in turn, increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies correlate lower incidence of cardiovascular disease with adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in inflammatory (TXB(2) and LTB(4)) and oxidative stress markers (urinary hydrogen peroxide levels and serum antioxidant capacity), in addition to classic lipid parameters, after a fat-rich meal administered to 12 normolipemic, healthy subjects. Following a Latin square design, subjects were divided into three groups, each one receiving a different kind of oil (extra virgin olive oil; EVOO, olive oil; OO or corn oil; CO, together with 150g of potatoes), with 2-week washout periods between treatments. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6h after the meal. A significant decrease in inflammatory markers, namely TXB(2) and LTB(4), after 2 and 6h after EVOO (but not OO or CO) consumption and a concomitant increase of serum antioxidant capacity were recorded. These data reinforce the notion that the Mediterranean diet reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease partially due to the protective role of its phenolic components, including those of extra virgin olive oil.

### The lactulose breath test can predict refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease by measuring bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine [^1172HmuJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

LBT Diagnosis

Based on the 2017 North American Consensus recommendations, the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is considered if the following criteria are met: (1) hydrogen levels ≥ 20 ppm within 90 minutes of substrate ingestion and (2) methane levels ≥ 10 ppm.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 software. The normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiroâ Wilk W test (Sâ W test). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating both the area under the curve and the diagnostic threshold corresponding to sensitivity and specificity.

### Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency: diagnostic challenges and response to enzyme replacement therapy [^1137f8rA]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Congenital sucrase-isomaltase (SI) deficiency is a rare genetic condition characterised by a deficiency in the brush-border SI enzyme, resulting in an inability to metabolise sucrose and starches. Six cases of congenital SI deficiency treated with Sucraid (sacrosidase, a yeast-derived enzyme that facilitates sucrose digestion) are described. Typical presenting symptoms were watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, sometimes noticeably worse after ingestion of fruit. Diagnosis is challenging since conventional hydrogen breath testing after an oral sucrose load is impractical in young children, and many laboratories no longer look for maldigested sucrose using faecal sugar chromatography. Confirmation is by disaccharidase assay of duodenal or jejunal mucosa obtained endoscopically. All six patients showed little improvement following advice regarding dietary management, but experienced a marked reduction in symptoms with sacrosidase administration; no adverse events were reported. Sacrosidase is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with congenital SI deficiency. Gene testing and clinical trial of sacrosidase may become an alternative to endoscopic biopsies for diagnosis.

Ingestion of concentrated solutions can cause extreme irritation, inflammation, and burns of the alimentary tract can occur, and hollow-organ distention and rupture is a significant danger. Hydrogen peroxide enemas have caused colonic rupture, intestinal gangrene with gas. be transported immediately to a medical facility for evaluation. Patients who have ingested hydrogen peroxide solutions should also be transported for medical evaluation. Persons who have no eye, skin, or throat irritation or who have mild or transient symptoms are unlikely. of this treatment. Careful aspiration of air through a central venous line may be attempted for patients in extremis. The diagnosis of acute hydrogen peroxide toxicity is primarily clinical based on eye and skin irritation or burns, white foam from the mouth, and gastric irritation.

Routine laboratory studies for all exposed patients include. CRC, glucose, and electrolyte determinations. For patients exposed through inhalation, useful studies include chest radiography, pulse oximetry, spirometry, and peak flow measurements. A radiograph of the abdomen and chest is advised if there are symptoms, or if a high concentration. is ingested to detect intravascular oxygen embolization. Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide can be assessed by adding 1 drop of 15% titanium chloride to an acidified mixture of equal parts of gastric contents and ethyl ether. A yellow to deep orange coloration of the aqueous layer indicates the formation of. H2TiO4 which is an indication of ingested peroxide. Consider hospitalizing symptomatic patients who have histories of substantial inhalation exposure and patients who have ingested a concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide. Patients who have complaints of chest pain, chest tightness, or cough should be observed for 24.

### Hydrogen peroxide | ToxFAQs ™ | ATSDR… [^111cHBs5]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2015). Low credibility.

Spanish: Peróxido de Hidrógeno CAS#: 7722–84–1 PDF Versionpdf icon. Hydrogen peroxide is a manufactured chemical, although small amounts of hydrogen peroxide gas may occur naturally in the air. Low exposure may occur from use at home; higher exposures may occur from industrial use. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide can cause irritation of the eyes, throat, respiratory airway, and skin. Drinking concentrated liquid can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal effects. This substance has been found in at least 18 of the 1, 585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Top of Page Hydrogen peroxide can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or by contact with the skin or eyes. Inhalation of household strength hydrogen peroxide can cause respiratory irritation. Exposure to household strength hydrogen peroxide can cause mild ocular irritation. Inhalation of vapors from.

concentrated solutions may result in severe pulmonary irritation. Ingestion of dilute solutions of hydrogen peroxide may result in vomiting, mild gastrointestinal irritation, gastric distension, and on rare occasions, gastrointestinal erosions or embolism. Ingestion of solutions of 10–20% strength produces similar symptoms, but exposed tissues may also be burned. Ingestion of even more concentrated solutions, in addition to the above, may also induce rapid loss of consciousness followed by respiratory paralysis. Eye exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide may result in pain and irritation, but severe injury is rare. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that hydrogen peroxide is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. There are no studies on the health effects of children exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

Documented cases of children being accidently exposed to hydrogen peroxide have described effects similar to those observed in adults. be stored out of the reach of children. There are no clinical tests that show that you have been exposed to hydrogen peroxide. White foam from the mouth immediately after ingestion of significant amounts may provide a clue to emergency personnel. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sets a limit of 1 part of hydrogen peroxide in a million.
