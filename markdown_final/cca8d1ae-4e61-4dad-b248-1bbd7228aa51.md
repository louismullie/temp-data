## Question

Constipation treatment pathway

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise constipation treatment pathway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the clinical flow from initial assessment through escalation. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and which guidelines to anchor each step to. Next, I will extract and synthesize key recommendations by step, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources. After that, I should double-check special populations and where the evidence is weaker. Finally, I will integrate a concise, clinically usable algorithm and note limitations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the overarching framework. A practical, stepwise approach moves from history and exam with alarm screening, to conservative measures, to OTC laxatives, to prescription agents, to physiologic testing for refractory cases, and finally to advanced or surgical options, with subtype-directed therapy and shared decision-making throughout. This mirrors contemporary AGA/ACG and ASCRS guidance and aligns with primary care pathways, so I should anchor to those sources to keep the flow evidence-based [^6d63e27b] [^93b0c0e2] [^3f5b3028].

> I need to check the initial assessment elements carefully. History should quantify stool frequency, form, straining, sensation of blockage, manual maneuvers, and red flags; the exam includes abdominal and focused anorectal assessment; routine labs are not recommended without alarm features, though a CBC and selective metabolic tests can be considered if clinically indicated; colonoscopy is reserved for alarm features or age-appropriate screening, not for routine constipation without red flags; I should confirm that these are strong or conditional recommendations with low-to-moderate certainty, which they are in ASCRS and AGA/ACG documents [^93b0c0e2] [^6d63e27b] [^7df4a795].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. I initially thought to include TSH, glucose, calcium, and creatinine broadly, but wait, I should verify the strength of that recommendation; AGA notes these are often done yet acknowledges limited diagnostic yield and cost-effectiveness, so I should frame them as selective rather than routine, especially when alarm features or secondary causes are suspected, and otherwise prioritize empiric therapy first [^f918d75b] [^6d63e27b].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative therapy. Ensure adequate hydration, dietary fiber targeting roughly 20–30 g/day if tolerated, and regular physical activity; I should confirm that both AGA/ACG and ASCRS endorse this as foundational, which they do, albeit with low-to-moderate certainty and the caveat that fiber may worsen symptoms in some patients, prompting individualized adjustment [^6d63e27b] [^93b0c0e2].

> I will now examine OTC laxatives as first-line pharmacotherapy. Osmotic agents such as polyethylene glycol are strongly recommended as first-line; stimulant laxatives like bisacodyl or senna can be used short-term or as rescue; I should double-check that both AGA/ACG and ASCRS align here, and yes, both endorse osmotics first-line and stimulants as second-line or rescue, with the caveat to monitor for tolerance and adverse effects [^6d63e27b] [^93b0c0e2] [^9a5bf50d] [^f7cf4016].

> Let me consider prescription options for inadequate response. Secretagogues such as linaclotide, plecanatide, and lubiprostone are recommended for CIC; prucalopride, a 5-HT4 agonist, is an option when laxatives are insufficient; I should confirm dosing, safety, and patient selection, and the AGA/ACG guideline provides condition-specific recommendations and emphasizes shared decision-making given cost and access considerations [^6d63e27b] [^68bed0d4].

> But wait, what if constipation is opioid-induced. I should confirm that first-line remains laxatives, but if refractory, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxegol, naldemedine, or methylnaltrexone are recommended; I need to ensure I cite the AGA OIC guideline correctly, which indeed supports these agents after laxative failure and stresses minimizing opioid dose and considering opioid rotation when feasible [^d82e521b] [^1c1b1ec2] [^8f34a8eb].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to physiologic testing. If symptoms persist despite appropriate trials of fiber and laxatives, or if defecatory symptoms predominate, anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion is recommended to identify pelvic floor dysfunction; if results are inconclusive, MR or barium defecography can be considered; I should confirm that AGA positions anorectal testing after laxative failure, which it does, and that ASCRS supports this stepwise approach [^f77ccbbd] [^93b0c0e2].

> I will now examine subtype-directed therapy. For defecatory disorders, pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback is superior to laxatives and should be prioritized; for slow-transit constipation confirmed by transit studies, options include intensified medical therapy or, in carefully selected refractory cases, colectomy; I should double-check that surgery is reserved only after excluding pelvic floor dysfunction and other contraindications, which is emphasized in surgical reviews and aligns with AGA guidance [^f77ccbbd] [^376fa86b] [^9ceb7568].

> Let me think about advanced and adjunctive options for refractory cases. Transanal irrigation can be considered in selected adults with chronic constipation, particularly with coexisting fecal incontinence or evacuation disorders, though evidence is largely observational and discontinuation rates vary; I should note that expert guidance positions TAI as a bridge or alternative when standard therapies fail, and that shared decision-making is essential given variability in outcomes and tolerability [^5592d6a6] [^1643f55c].

> I should confirm special populations and settings. In pediatrics, first-line is osmotic laxatives such as PEG, with lactulose as an alternative if PEG is unavailable; escalation includes stimulant laxatives and, for refractory cases, rectal therapies or specialty referral; in advanced cancer, anticipate constipation with opioids and use prophylactic laxatives, preferring osmotic or stimulant agents and reserving rectal therapies for impaction; in older adults, prioritize gentle osmotic agents, avoid bulk laxatives if narrow-caliber colon is suspected, and reassess medications that cause constipation [^7e2e3587] [^418ebc6f] [^007db0df] [^3f5b3028].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and certainty language I am using. ASCRS and AGA/ACG employ GRADE with strong versus conditional recommendations and high, moderate, low, or very low certainty; I need to ensure I match the strength of phrasing to the guideline language, for example, "offer osmotic laxatives first-line" is a strong recommendation with moderate certainty, whereas "consider lactulose if OTC therapies fail" is conditional with low certainty, which I have reflected accurately here [^0edd51ff] [^6d63e27b].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with history, exam, and selective testing only if indicated; initiate fiber, fluids, and activity; add osmotic laxatives; escalate to stimulants or prescription agents based on response; evaluate for defecatory disorders with manometry and balloon expulsion if refractory; tailor therapy to subtype with biofeedback for pelvic floor dysfunction or surgical consultation for selected slow-transit cases; incorporate special-population nuances and shared decision-making at each step; this aligns with AGA/ACG, ASCRS, and primary care pathways and is the most defensible, reference-anchored flow I can construct from the available evidence [^6d63e27b] [^93b0c0e2] [^3f5b3028].

The constipation treatment pathway is a **stepwise, evidence-based approach** that begins with lifestyle and dietary changes, then escalates to OTC osmotic or stimulant laxatives, and advances to prescription agents (secretagogues, prokinetics, or PAMORAs) if needed. For refractory cases, **anorectal testing** (manometry, balloon expulsion, colonic transit) guides therapy, including biofeedback for pelvic floor dysfunction or surgery for slow-transit constipation. Management is individualized, with special considerations for opioid-induced constipation, older adults, and pediatrics, and **regular reassessment** is essential to optimize outcomes [^6d63e27b] [^93b0c0e2] [^376fa86b].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **History and physical examination**: Assess stool frequency, consistency, straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and use of manual maneuvers; identify alarm features (rectal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, family history of colorectal cancer) [^3f5b3028] [^e0991418].

- **Laboratory tests**: Consider CBC, TSH, glucose, calcium, and creatinine if clinically indicated; routine testing is not recommended without alarm features [^f918d75b].

- **Colonoscopy**: Indicated for patients with alarm features, age-appropriate screening, or before surgical intervention [^7df4a795].

---

## Classification of constipation

Constipation is classified into **three main subtypes**:

| **Subtype** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Normal transit constipation | Common, often related to diet, stress, or medications [^376fa86b] |
| Slow transit constipation | Delayed colonic transit, often requiring specialized testing [^c6e9abe5] |
| Outlet obstruction (defecatory disorders) | Pelvic floor dysfunction, often requiring biofeedback therapy [^376fa86b] |

---

## Stepwise treatment pathway

### Step 1: lifestyle and dietary modifications

- **Dietary fiber**: Aim for 20–30 g/day; effective for normal transit constipation [^3f5b3028].

- **Fluid intake**: Adequate hydration supports stool softness and transit [^3f5b3028].

- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise improves bowel motility [^3f5b3028].

- **Toileting habits**: Encourage regular, unhurried toilet routines [^notfound].

---

### Step 2: over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives

- **Osmotic laxatives**: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is first-line; safe and effective for chronic use [^6a4b3857] [^3f5b3028].

- **Stimulant laxatives**: Bisacodyl or senna for rescue therapy or second-line use [^9a5bf50d] [^f7cf4016].

- **Stool softeners**: Docusate sodium may be used but is less effective than osmotic agents [^notfound].

---

### Step 3: prescription medications

- **Secretagogues**: Linaclotide, plecanatide, and lubiprostone increase intestinal secretion and are effective for CIC [^notfound].

- **Prokinetic agents**: Prucalopride is recommended for CIC refractory to laxatives [^9ae63898].

- **Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs)**: Naloxegol, naldemedine, or methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation [^1c1b1ec2] [^d82e521b].

---

### Step 4: specialized testing and advanced therapies

- **Anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion**: Identify defecatory disorders [^f77ccbbd].

- **Biofeedback therapy**: First-line for pelvic floor dysfunction [^f77ccbbd].

- **Colonic transit studies**: Confirm slow transit constipation [^c6e9abe5].

- **Surgical options**: Colectomy for refractory slow transit constipation after excluding pelvic floor dysfunction [^c6e9abe5].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Opioid-induced constipation**: Use PAMORAs and adjust opioid regimen when possible [^1c1b1ec2] [^8f34a8eb].

- **Older adults**: Use gentle osmotic laxatives; avoid stimulants long-term due to risk of dependency [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: PEG is first-line; lactulose is an alternative if PEG is unavailable [^7e2e3587].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular reassessment should track **symptom improvement**, medication adherence, and adverse effects. Therapy should be adjusted based on response and patient preference, with escalation considered for refractory cases [^68bed0d4].

---

The constipation treatment pathway is a **stepwise approach** that begins with lifestyle and dietary changes, escalates to OTC laxatives, and advances to prescription medications and specialized testing for refractory cases. Individualized care and regular reassessment are essential to optimize outcomes.

Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms

A number of groups have provided recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of constipation;, however, no standardized treatment guidelines have gained acceptance in general medical practice. Although the evidence for a number of interventions (including modifications to diet and lifestyle) is weak or contradictory, all the guidelines recommend that these be tried before pharmacological intervention. In general, where treatment pathways are recommended, the sequence is:

Exclude other pathologies and secondary causes.,
Begin treatment with dietary and lifestyle adjustments.,
Move to osmotic laxatives, stool softeners and bulk-forming agents – there is no consensus on the order in which these should be tried.
Move to stimulant laxatives, suppositories and/or enemas,– some guidelines recommend medical supervision at this stage.
Surgery should be used as a last resort or to treat identified disorders that require surgical correction.

Although prokinetic agents feature in the two sets of US guidelines (Grade A recommendation), these are now out of date. Tegaserod has now been limited to emergency use in the US and has not received licensing approval in the EU. Prucalopride has recently received EU approval for the treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief; this is not mentioned in the guidelines.

Once organic disorders and obstructions have been excluded, a functional bowel disorder is the most likely explanation for the constipation. Most patients with chronic constipation report minimal abdominal bloating or discomfort associated with their other symptoms of chronic constipation; however, in some patients, as symptoms often overlap, it may be difficult to distinguish chronic constipation and IBS-C. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Chronic Constipation Task Force defined IBS-C as clinically important abdominal discomfort associated with symptoms of constipation. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for IBS indicate a positive diagnosis only if the person has abdominal pain/discomfort that is either relieved by defecation, or associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form, and at least two of the following: altered stool passage; abdominal bloating, distension, tension, or hardness, symptoms made worse by eating and passage of mucus.

- Education
- Diet
- Verify proper formula preparation
- Diary" with reassessment at "Treatment effective?". If not effective, escalate to "Start oral medication
- Occasional suppository" and proceed to "Re-assessment

### Consensus recommendations for the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness [^89a70d1c]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Constipation is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced, progressive illnesses. Although opioids are one of the most common causes of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness, it is important to note that there are many other potential etiologies and combinations of causes that should be taken into consideration when making treatment decisions. Management approaches involve a combination of good assessment techniques, preventive regimens, appropriate pharmacological treatment of established constipation, and frequent monitoring. In this vulnerable patient population, maintenance of comfort and respect for individual preferences and sensitivities should be overriding considerations when making clinical decisions. This consensus document was developed by a multidisciplinary group of leading Canadian palliative care specialists in an effort to define best practices in palliative constipation management that will be relevant and useful to health care professionals. Although a wide range of options exists to help treat constipation and prevent its development or recurrence, there is a limited body of evidence evaluating pharmacological interventions. These recommendations are, therefore, based on the best of the available evidence, combined with expert opinion derived from experience in clinical practice. This underscores the need for further clinical evaluation of the available agents to create a robust, evidence-based foundation for treatment decisions in the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness.

### Chronic constipation: a critical review [^da65c45f]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a very common symptom that is rarely associated with life-threatening diseases, but has a substantial impact on patient quality of life and consumption of healthcare resources. Despite the large number of affected patients and the social relevance of the condition, no cost-effectiveness analysis has been made of any diagnostic or therapeutic algorithm, and there are few data comparing different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the long term. In this scenario, increasing emphasis has been placed on demonstrating that a number of older and new therapeutic options are effective in treating chronic constipation in well-performed randomised controlled trials, but there is still debate as to when these therapeutic options should be included in diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. The aim of this review is to perform a critical evaluation of the current diagnostic and therapeutic options available for adult patients with chronic constipation in order to identify a rational patient approach; furthermore we attempt to clarify some of the more controversial points to aid clinicians in managing this symptom in a more efficacious and cost-effective manner.

### Implementing a standardized constipation-management pathway to reduce resource utilization [^4b30a7f1]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Constipation is commonly diagnosed in our pediatric emergency department (ED). Care has varied significantly, with a heavy reliance on abdominal radiography (AR) for the diagnosis of and inpatient management for bowel cleanout. We implemented a standardized approach to caring for patients presenting to a pediatric ED with symptoms consistent with constipation, emphasizing clinical history, physical examination, less reliance on AR, and standardized home management.

Methods

Using quality improvement (QI) methodology, a multidisciplinary group developed an ED constipation management pathway, encouraging less reliance on AR for diagnosis and promoting home management over inpatient bowel cleanout. The pathway included a home management "gift basket" containing over-the-counter medications and educational materials to promote successful bowel cleanout. Outcome measures included pathway utilization, AR rate, ED cost and length of stay, and ED admission rate for constipation.

Results

Within 3 months, > 90% of patients discharged home with an ED disposition diagnosis of constipation left with standardized educational materials and home medications. Staff education and feedback, pathway and gift basket changes, and a higher threshold for inpatient management led to significant decreases in AR rate (73.3%-24.6%, P < .001), average per-patient cost ($637.42-$538.85), length of stay (223–196 minutes, P < .001), and ED admission rate (15.3%-5.4%, P < .001), with no concerning missed diagnoses or increases in ED revisit rate.

Conclusions

An ED QI project standardizing the care of pediatric constipation was implemented successfully, leading to a sustainable decrease in resource utilization. The next phase of the project will focus on collaborating with community providers to reduce ED utilization.

### Doing' detective work' to find a cancer: how are non-specific symptom pathways for cancer investigation organised, and what are the implications for safety and quality of care? A multisite qualitative approach [^c0fb01d6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, the UK has developed a cancer diagnosis policy programme to align outcomes with other high-income countries. This programme includes quality indicators such as rapid referral-to-treatment intervals and standardised investigative pathways. Service improvement has focused on a number of indicators of poor delivery, including emergency cancer presentations, multiple primary care consultations before referral and referrals to multiple specialties before diagnosis.

Around half of the patients with cancer initially experience non-specific symptoms (NSS), causing delays in referral, investigation and diagnosis. These include site-specific symptoms such as coughing and constipation, as well as non-site-specific signs like fatigue and weight loss. Previously, patients with non-site-specific symptoms often experienced diagnostic delays due to the undifferentiated nature of the symptoms, and the need for multiple suspected cancer referrals before diagnosis. To meet this need, the National Health Service (NHS) long-term plan introduced novel services in the UK known as NSS pathways. These are urgent referral services based on the Danish three-legged model, which includes a pathway for specific alarm symptoms, 'No-Yes Clinics' for low-risk-but-not-no-risk symptoms and a pathway for non-specific serious symptoms. The latter services are designed to determine the cause of NSSs rather than solely ruling out specific cancers. Similar pathways have been developed in Norway and Sweden. Patients undergo faecal and blood testing in primary care, followed by comprehensive assessments, imaging and consultant-led diagnostic management involving different medical specialties in secondary care. Patients are either referred onward to specialist services for further investigation and treatment or discharged to primary care with management advice where appropriate. National guidance emphasises the importance of avoiding multiple fragmented referrals and taking a holistic approach to diagnosis in NSS pathways.

Only a relatively small percentage of clinically constipated patients seek medical attention and most can be managed satisfactorily with conservative measures. This review mainly addresses those patients who have refractory or difficult-to-manage functional constipation who are referred to gastrointestinal specialists. Areas of review include insights into pathophysiology, the utility of diagnostic testing and the author's opinions concerning available pharmacologic agents, the role of behavioural therapies and the indications for surgical interventions in this heterogeneous group of patients.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^f77ccbbd]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests — anorectal testing pathway for laxative nonresponders is specified. This algorithm starts by recommending anorectal testing for patients who do not respond to a trial of laxatives and/or fiber. Anorectal testing is simple and safe and can potentially modify management; a rectal balloon expulsion test is also inexpensive. There is evidence that pelvic floor retraining is superior to laxatives for defecatory disorders, so anorectal testing may be considered earlier when symptoms or signs strongly suggest pelvic floor dysfunction. Although anorectal manometry and a rectal balloon expulsion test generally suffice to diagnose or exclude a defecatory disorder, defecography, performed with barium or magnetic resonance imaging, is useful if results are inconclusive.

### Transanal irrigation: bridging the gap in treatment for chronic constipation and / or faecal incontinence – A systematic review and management guidance [^82ee4031]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates that TAI may be an effective treatment option in patients with CC and/or FI. Nonetheless, there is a need for randomised controlled trials to investigate its efficacy and specific research questions (e.g. comparison of low vs. high‐volume TAI). We propose the position of TAI in the treatment pathway of patients with CC and/or FI and provide knowledge gaps and areas for future research.

### Transanal irrigation: bridging the gap in treatment for chronic constipation and / or faecal incontinence – A systematic review and management guidance [^5592d6a6]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

The aims of the study were to: (1) update a systematic review on the efficacy of transanal irrigation (TAI) in patients with chronic constipation (CC) and/or faecal incontinence (FI); (2) provide guidance on the position of TAI in the treatment pathway of CC and FI; and (3) discuss knowledge gaps and areas of future research.

Method

A collaborative of 11 experts (gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and clinical scientists) from eight European countries was established. The expert group was divided into three main groups, with each group leading a specific section (systematic review, treatment pathway, and knowledge gaps). A previously published systematic review on TAI was updated by conducting an additional search on 12 April 2025. Studies on TAI in specific subgroups (neurogenic bowel dysfunction, low anterior resection syndrome) were excluded.

Results

Sixteen studies involving 1567 (range 16–507) patients were included. Only one underpowered randomised trial was performed, which demonstrated that high‐volume TAI may be more effective than low‐volume TAI in patients with CC. Most other studies (observational) showed improvement in symptoms and/or quality of life to some extent, with a large variation in outcomes used. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 3–57% of patients. The position of TAI in the treatment pathway of CC and FI was proposed, and 13 knowledge gaps were provided.

Conclusion

TAI may be an effective treatment in patients with CC and/or FI. There is a need for randomised controlled trials to study its efficacy and current knowledge gaps.

### Using best practice to create a pathway to improve management of irritable bowel syndrome: aiming for timely diagnosis, effective treatment and equitable care [^4388a601]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our model highlights that there is no single solution to IBS and that it is essential to have the multidisciplinary approaches of effective dietetic intervention, reliable faecal biomarkers and GP education in order to encourage long-term and effective patient self-management. With this combination it is possible to have a successful and cost-effective pathway, which delivers significant NHS savings and also high levels of patient satisfaction in a community setting while allowing secondary care gastroenterology services to target their resources more effectively.

### Transanal irrigation: bridging the gap in treatment for chronic constipation and / or faecal incontinence – A systematic review and management guidance [^c5bcb694]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review of 16 studies including 1567 non‐NBD/non‐LARS patients with CC and/or FI demonstrates that TAI may be an effective treatment option in this population. Though most of the studies were observational, they showed an improvement in symptoms and/or quality of life to some extent. Validated PROMs were used in only 56% of the studies. Only one (significantly underpowered) randomised trial was performed, which demonstrated that high‐volume TAI may be more effective than low‐volume TAI in patients with CC. Treatment discontinuation was reported in a wide range between studies (3–57%), which may relate to the equally wide range in follow‐up (6 weeks and a mean of 8.5 years). Adverse events were reported by 13–59% of patients, with the majority being mild. No bowel perforations were reported in the 1567 patients evaluated. There was marked variability in outcomes used between the different studies.

Treatment pathways

We are aware that the treatment pathways are a pragmatic proposition intended to guide healthcare professionals and lack robust scientific evidence. Accordingly, with the treatment pathways, we do not intend to replace current guidelines on CC and FI.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation [^c6e9abe5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Slow transit constipation (STC), a subtype of functional constipation characterized by delayed colonic transit (> 72 h), imposes substantial physical and psychological burdens.

Aims

This review synthesizes current evidence on STC epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal management.

Methods

A literature review was conducted using PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for all articles and trials with the following search terms: "Slow transit constipation" OR "Chronic constipation" OR "STC". The comprehensive literature search was conducted for relevant articles published up to June 2025. The search yielded approximately 1005 records from PubMed and 220 records from CNKI. The abstracts and titles of all retrieved articles were reviewed for relevance. Articles were included in this narrative review if they provided original insights, comprehensive summaries, or presented clinical trial data on the pathophysiology, diagnostic innovations, or therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation. Both foundational and recent high-impact studies were prioritized.

Results

Key pathophysiological mechanisms involve: smooth muscle atrophy/fibrosis, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) depletion, enteric nervous system dysregulation, hormonal imbalances (thyroid/sex hormones), and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Diagnosis integrates: (1) Rome IV symptom criteria (≤ 3 spontaneous bowel movements/week, hard stools, straining); (2) Objective transit testing (scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule); (3) Exclusion of secondary causes. Conservative management emphasizes fiber intake, hydration, and physical activity. Pharmacotherapy includes osmotic laxatives (first-line), prokinetics (prucalopride; second-line), and microbiota modulators. For refractory cases, colectomy requires strict selection: failed conservative therapy, confirmed transit delay, and excluded pelvic floor dysfunction. Future research should prioritize genetic susceptibility, signaling pathway modulation, and personalized algorithms.

Conclusions

The explicit pathogenesis of STC remains incompletely characterized. Besides referencing the Rome IV criteria, its diagnosis requires a comprehensive assessment integrating the clinical symptoms and various accessorial examinations. The management of STC also demands clinical gastroenterologist adopt a comprehensive approach, including appropriate lifestyle, pharmacological interventions, psychotherapy, and even surgical treatment. This review provides multidimensional ideas for gastroenterologists to treat patients grappling with STC.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) interpretation — recommendation strength and certainty are defined as follows: For a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences." For a conditional recommendation, "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision-making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." GRADE certainty rankings state: High — "The authors are confident that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect." Moderate — "The authors believe that the true effect is probably close to the estimated effect." Low — "The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect." Very low — "The true effect is probably markedly different from the estimated effect."

### Refractory constipation: how to evaluate and treat [^f9e65f24]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients are often referred for treatment of refractory constipation that may result from uncontrolled underlying disease or ineffective treatment. This article reviews clinical testing in patients with refractory constipation, differentiating subtypes of primary chronic idiopathic constipation, and common pitfalls in assessment of refractory chronic constipation. The constipation may also be refractory because of significant associated diseases affecting the colon and resulting in slow transit constipation. The choice of therapy is best guided by the subtype. Management of refractory constipation requires correct diagnosis and individualized treatment, which may rarely include conservative surgery (loop ileostomy).

### Cancer chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and constipation: mechanisms of damage and prevention strategies [^6c0475fa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea and constipation are common toxicities of chemotherapy, and both are poorly understood. They are manifestations of alimentary mucositis, a condition which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract.

Discussion

The absolute percentage of patients that have diarrhoea or constipation as a result of their treatment has yet to be fully defined, although general estimates place 10% of patients with advanced cancer as being afflicted. Although there has been some major progress in recent years with understanding the mechanisms of oral and small intestinal mucositis, diarrhoea and constipation have received very little attention. Although diarrhoea is a well-recognised side-effect of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, very little research has been conducted on the mechanisms behind diarrhoea or its treatment. Much of the information in the published literature is based on clinical observations with very little basic science existing. Constipation is not as well recognised and very little is known about its mechanisms.

Objectives

This review will examine in detail the potentially complex pathogenesis of post-chemotherapy diarrhoea in both animal models and the clinical setting. Furthermore, it will explore what is known about chemotherapy-induced constipation. It will then outline an evidence-based pathway for the investigation and treatment of post-chemotherapy diarrhoea and constipation.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and current management of chronic constipation [^863d8b35]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Chronic constipation is prevalent in Western countries and is a complaint that is commonly seen in clinical practice. Only a relatively small percentage of constipated patients seek medical evaluation and most can be managed satisfactorily with first-line, conservative therapy. In patients with severe, refractory constipation, additional studies of colonic and anorectal function have clinical utility, as such patients are candidates for therapies not given to most constipated patients. This article reviews the modern principles and therapies used to manage chronic constipation of varying severities.

### Constipation: pathophysiology and management [^da37a14c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Continuing advances in pharmaceutical development are providing an expanding array of treatment approaches for patients with chronic constipation. More comprehensive characterization of pancolonic motility carries the promise of improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this common disorder. Chronic constipation which responds poorly to laxatives may result from the use of drugs such as opioids, or from defecation disorders and advanced colonic dysmotility.

Recent Findings

This article highlights improved characterization of pancolonic motility, evidence of efficacy of established and novel drugs for both idiopathic and opioid-induced constipation and a new algorithm for the evaluation of patients with chronic idiopathic constipation who respond inadequately to available laxatives.

Summary

The articles cited in this review inform the reader of new developments in the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic constipation.

### Algorithms or biomarkers in patients with lower DGBI? [^9527dd1e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Several organizations have proposed guidelines or clinical decision tools for the management of patients with disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) affecting the lower digestive tract including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. Such algorithms are based on sequential therapeutic trials and modifying the treatment strategy based on efficacy and adverse events.

Purpose

The aims of this review are to evaluate the evidence for efficacy of second- and third-line pharmacotherapies and to assess the evidence for the alternative option to manage subgroups of patients with symptoms suggestive of lower DGBI based on diagnostic tests or documented dysfunctions. The preeminent tests to identify such subgroups that present with symptoms that overlap with lower DGBI are detailed: digital rectal examination as well as anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion for evacuation disorders, detailed measurements of colonic transit, and diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea or carbohydrate malabsorption based on biochemical measurements. The review also addresses the cost implications of screening to exclude alternative diagnoses and the costs of therapy associated with the therapeutic options following an algorithmic approach to treatment from the perspective of society, insurer, or patient. Finally, the costs of the diagnostic tests to identify actionable biomarkers and the evidence of efficacy of individualized therapy based on formal diagnosis or documentation of abnormal functions are detailed in the review.

### Real-world treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^68bed0d4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation are complex, overlapping conditions. Although multiple guidelines have informed healthcare providers on appropriate treatment options for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, little direction is offered on treatment selection. First-line treatment options usually include fiber and over-the-counter osmotic laxatives; however, these are insufficient for many individuals. When these options fail, prescription secretagogues (plecanatide, linaclotide, lubiprostone, and tenapanor [pending commercial availability]), or serotonergic agents (prucalopride and tegaserod) are generally preferred. Individuals experiencing concurrent abdominal pain and/or bloating may experience greater overall improvements from prescription therapies because these agents have been proven to reduce concurrent abdominal and bowel symptoms. Should initial prescription treatments fail, retrying past treatment options (if not adequately trialed initially), combining agents from alternative classes, or use of adjunctive therapies may be considered. Given the broad spectrum of available agents, therapy should be tailored by mutual decision-making between the patient and practitioner. Overall, patients need to be actively monitored and managed to maximize clinical outcomes.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^aa7cc264]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric refractory constipation (RC) limitations and conclusions — There is variability in the evaluation and management of RC among pediatric gastroenterologists, and this article is an attempt to provide a standardized definition of pediatric RC and establish a common management pathway for this complex patient population. In the treatment of pediatric RC, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to guide when to use specific constipation medications over others and to investigate the safety, efficacy, and outcomes of secretagogues or serotonin agonists alone or in combination with stimulant laxatives; further assessment of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, protocolization of pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) with and without feedback, and employment of occupational therapists would also help advance the field. From a surgical standpoint, there is a need to develop biomarkers associated with colonic distention and dysfunction to better understand indications for surgical interventions in RC, refine the identification and long-term management of diverting ileostomies, and pursue protocolization of tapering off and discontinuing ACEs. Key limitations include that the major limitation is in the search methods due to the lack of a clear definition for pediatric RC, that an organized framework like the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach could not be utilized, and that the absence of a common definition has limited creation of predictive models through longitudinal studies. Timely identification of pediatric RC combined with consistent use of stimulant laxatives and use of common management strategies may improve QoL for pediatric patients, and a standardized pediatric RC definition will benefit the advancement of evaluation and management through future targeted studies.

Development of recommendations

In line with our operating procedure steps, the full technical reviews, summary of findings tables and evidence to decision frameworks will be given to the GDG members for review. The data and GRADE summary of findings tables will be added to the evidence to decision frameworks.

A face-to-face meeting will be held to discuss any key features of note in the evidence, areas of convergence in individual studies, direct and network meta-analysis.

Where there are clear signals in the evidence base, recommendations will be prepared, followed by voting. Where there is a more disordered or diverging evidence base, discussion and if an appropriate recommendation can be developed, voting will be held.

All recommendations will follow the GRADE approach and nomenclature with the strength of a recommendation based on the evidence to decision frameworks, aligned with the language of the aforementioned level of strength.

The non-voting team will refine this into a final list of recommendations and ensure the strength of the recommendations to be made is consistent with the evidence presented and views of the GDG, as per the GRADE recommendation guidance. They will also facilitate the face-to-face meeting.

Voting will be anonymous and all members with conflicts will abstain. An online voting system will count YES, NO and ABSTAIN votes. If ≥ 75% of voting members agree, a recommendation will be passed. If there is no such an agreement, a further discussion will be held for a maximum of 30 min with either the same or revised recommendation voted. If no consensus can be reached, the recommendation will be left pending further exploration and revisiting.

If the evidence does not support a GRADE level recommendation but there is a sufficiently clear experiential and broader evidence base as well as a significant agreement on a statement that has clear actionable benefit, a Good Practice Statement will be made.

The final proposals will be agreed by consensus, with the strength of agreement, certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations all presented.

The final synthesised recommendations will be prepared in a guideline to meet the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN and journal publication standards. The evidence for decision frameworks will be made available as supplementary material and the technical evidence published in full as concomitant outputs to support the main guidance.

### Transanal irrigation: bridging the gap in treatment for chronic constipation and / or faecal incontinence – A systematic review and management guidance [^33306afd]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Faecal incontinence

The pathway for FI is shown in Figure 4 (noting that significant symptoms of incontinence and constipation very frequently coexist). After adequate identification of the cause/pathophysiology of FI, management of stool consistency is mandatory. If present, surgical correction of a substantial anal sphincter defect or rectal prolapse should be considered. Patients with FI may benefit from non‐invasive treatments including percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation or biofeedback. In those patients with refractory symptoms, other surgical/endoscopic options should be offered including sacral neuromodulation, intrarectal botox injections or a colostomy. TAI can be considered in patients with passive FI secondary to incomplete rectal evacuation, and in those with overflow incontinence. Moreover, TAI may be useful in the reduction of psychological burden before treatment initiation and in cases when anorectal investigations are delayed. TAI can also be considered in patients not fit for surgical procedures or truly refractory or failure cases.

Irritable bowel syndrome

A large proportion of IBS patients are dissatisfied with their medical therapy. However, TAI has, as yet, not been established as standard therapy due to the complexity of the disease, and it might trigger worsening of symptoms.

Knowledge gaps

In Table 2 we provide 13 knowledge gaps and areas for further research in the field of TAI. A summary of the main knowledge gaps is shown in Figure 5. Though the list is not exhaustive and other knowledge gaps can be identified, the authors propose that these are the most unmet needs. A number of different studies should be performed to address these unmet needs. Examples include studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms of action of TAI (e.g. using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging), careful patient selection (e.g. stratification using colo‐anorectal physiological investigations), the development of TAI‐specific PROMs which require testing for validity and reliability, appropriately designed clinical trials to determine the position of TAI in the treatment pyramid, and health economic studies.

### Management of constipation in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^a94cd557]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a practical, readily applied algorithm for primary health care providers to identify, evaluate, and manage constipation in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

Methods

The Gastroenterology Committee of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN), a multisite consortium of centers dedicated to improving standards of medical care for children with ASDs, guided the development of the constipation algorithm through expert opinion and literature review. The algorithm was finalized based on results of field testing by nongastrointestinal, ATN autism medical specialists at 4 ATN sites. A systematic review and grading of the literature pertaining to constipation and children with ASDs was also performed.

Results

Consensus among the ATN Gastroenterology Committee identified that in children with ASDs, (1) subtle or atypical symptoms might indicate the presence of constipation; (2) screening, identification, and treatment through a deliberate approach for underlying causes of constipation is appropriate; (3) diagnostic-therapeutic intervention can be provided when constipation is documented; and (4) careful follow-up after any intervention be performed to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of the therapy. Literature review revealed limited evidence for the clinical evaluation or treatment strategies of children with ASD and constipation.

Conclusions

Constipation and its underlying etiology have the potential to be effectively identified and managed using a systematic approach. Lack of evidence on this topic in the literature emphasizes the need for research.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation [^1e25f3fe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research directions

Despite considerable progress in the field of STC, numerous critical issues remain to be addressed.

At the basic research level, genetic investigations are anticipated to provide novel insights into STC pathogenesis. Future studies should focus on identifying susceptibility genes associated with STC and elucidating the impact of genetic polymorphisms on intestinal motility, neuroendocrine regulation, and the gut microbiome. Advanced techniques such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) will facilitate large-scale screening of genetic variants across diverse populations, enabling the construction of risk models linking genetic factors to STC susceptibility and paving the way for early genetic diagnosis and preemptive intervention. Research into cellular signaling pathways is equally crucial; further dissection of aberrant signal transduction within intestinal smooth muscle cells, ICCs, and neurons may reveal novel therapeutic targets. Evidence suggests that specific intracellular signaling pathways play a key role in regulating intestinal motility; modulation of these pathways via selective inhibitors or activators may yield innovative therapeutic breakthroughs for STC.

In clinical practice, optimization of surgical strategies remains a priority. With the advent of precision medicine, future efforts may leverage advanced preoperative assessments — such as multimodal imaging integration and molecular markers of intestinal function — to tailor surgical interventions, enhance procedural accuracy and efficacy, and reduce postoperative complications. Long-term postoperative follow-up studies are urgently needed; the establishment of large-scale, multicenter follow-up databases will enable longitudinal assessment of bowel function recovery, quality of life, and the evolution of potential complications, thereby providing a robust foundation for comprehensive evaluation of surgical outcomes and further refinement of surgical protocols.

In the realm of conservative therapy, exploration of combination regimens holds significant promise. Detailed investigation of synergistic mechanisms among various conservative modalities — such as optimal integration of dietary modification, pharmacotherapy, psychological intervention, and exercise rehabilitation — may facilitate the development of more effective comprehensive treatment packages. Large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of combination versus monotherapy approaches will provide high-level evidence to inform clinical practice, enabling patients to derive maximal benefit from individualized, precision-based combination therapies and improving long-term prognosis.

The future of STC research is replete with both challenges and opportunities. Interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of basic and clinical research will be essential to overcoming this complex disorder, ultimately enhancing patient quality of life and alleviating the societal healthcare burden.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^9ae63898]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

As previously mentioned, guidelines and algorithms for the management and treatment of chronic constipation have not taken into account more recent therapeutic developments. Although a new set of Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithms covering the diagnosis and management of FGIDs including chronic constipationand refractory constipationhave been recently published, newer agents have not been included. According to these guidelines, patients with constipation that is refractory to a high-fiber diet and traditional laxatives should be referred for physiological testing, such as anorectal manometry, rectal balloon expulsion, and colon transit. Now, with the recent availability of prokinetic agents such as prucalopride, an additional therapeutic step can be added to these existing guidelines. Once idiopathic chronic constipation has been identified, and IBS and secondary constipation have been excluded, empirical treatment with osmotic and/or stimulant laxatives should be employed. Following this, if patients still experience continuous symptoms (e.g. bloating, abdominal discomfort and incomplete bowel movements), a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride could be considered (Fig. 2). If constipation symptoms are refractory to pharmacological treatment, patients should be referred for physiological testing as outlined in the published Rome algorithm for refractive constipation and difficult defecation (Fig. 3). Patients should only be referred for surgery following colon transit testing without, and then with, laxatives.

### Diagnostic approach to chronic constipation in adults [^e0991418]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Constipation is traditionally defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week. Risk factors for constipation include female sex, older age, inactivity, low caloric intake, low-fiber diet, low income, low educational level, and taking a large number of medications. Chronic constipation is classified as functional (primary) or secondary. Functional constipation can be divided into normal transit, slow transit, or outlet constipation. Possible causes of secondary chronic constipation include medication use, as well as medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism or irritable bowel syndrome. Frail older patients may present with nonspecific symptoms of constipation, such as delirium, anorexia, and functional decline. The evaluation of constipation includes a history and physical examination to rule out alarm signs and symptoms. These include evidence of bleeding, unintended weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, acute onset constipation in older patients, and rectal prolapse. Patients with one or more alarm signs or symptoms require prompt evaluation. Referral to a subspecialist for additional evaluation and diagnostic testing may be warranted.

### Creation of an inflammatory bowel disease referral pathway for identifying patients who would benefit from inflammatory bowel disease specialist consultation [^499da9f4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Stratification of Criteria Into 2 Groups and Pathway Finalization

Based on panel feedback, criteria were stratified into major criteria (median appropriateness score ≥ 7) and minor criteria (median appropriateness score of 5–7). Several factors previously noted for exclusion during the initial meetings were reviewed, including disease duration, diagnosis of IBS or dyspepsia, family history of IBD, tachycardia, fatty liver, constipation, age, and body mass index. After surveying the expert panel, < 30 or > 50 years of age and family history of IBD were added as minor criteria.

The final pathway was then sent to the full panel for review (Figure 3) and unanimously agreed upon to be appropriate. The panel was asked to confirm whether the finalized consult care pathway was supported by best available evidence, and to provide a score of the strength from 1 (very weak evidence) to 5 (very strong evidence). There was universal agreement that the IBD consult care pathway was supported by the literature (mean score = 4.2). All panelists agreed that the presence of at least 1 major criteria or the presence of at least 2 minor criteria should suggest the need for referral for consultation.

### Constipation: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^60432d7f]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic constipation accounts for at least 8 million annual visits to health care providers in the United States and is associated with large expenditures for diagnostic testing and prescription and nonprescription laxatives.

Observations

Strong evidence for efficacy has been established for stimulant and osmotic laxatives, new intestinal secretogogues, and peripherally restricted μ-opiate receptor antagonists, the latter a major advance in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). An algorithm provided to evaluate chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) that is refractory to available laxatives focuses on the importance of defecation disorders and biofeedback therapies. When used appropriately, available stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl are both safe and effective when used long-term. There is a paucity of (and a strong desire for) studies that compare inexpensive laxatives with newer agents that work by other mechanisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The choice of treatment for CIC and OIC should be based on cost as well as efficacy. The small subgroup of patients who do not respond to currently available laxatives requires further evaluation at experienced centers that are capable of performing studies of defecation and colonic transit.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^e922dc0f]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To formulate timely evidence-based guidelines for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Setting

Constipation is a major untoward effect of opioids. Increasing prescription of opioids has correlated to increased incidence of opioid-induced constipation. However, the inhibitory effects of opioids are not confined to the colon, but also affect higher segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the coining of the term "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction."

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Predefined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to identify and categorize relevant papers. A series of statements were formulated and justified by a comment, then labeled with the degree of agreement and their level of evidence as judged by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) system.

Results

From a list of 10,832 potentially relevant studies, 33 citations were identified for review. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications. Current definitions, prevalence, and mechanism of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction were reviewed, and a treatment algorithm and statements regarding patient management were developed to provide guidance on clinical best practice in the management of patients with opioid-induced constipation and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Conclusions

In recent years, more insight has been gained in the pathophysiology of this "entity"; new treatment approaches have been developed, but guidelines on clinical best practice are still lacking. Current knowledge is insufficient regarding management of the opioid side effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, but recommendations can be derived from what we know at present.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline — consensus process, grading, and scope: Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions was graded, and three consensus meetings were held in September 2012, February 2013, and May 2013 using a 9-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 9 = fully agree). Consensus was defined a priori as > 75% of members voting 6, 7, 8, or 9, and consensus was reached for all questions. The guideline presents 2 algorithms; one pertains to the infant from birth to 6 months (instead of 1 year) and the other to the older child, reflecting that infants < 6 months old have different diagnostic considerations. Both algorithms apply to any child presenting with constipation of at least 2 weeks' duration and include evaluation and treatment options for "intractable" constipation. This guideline should be revised every 3 to 5 years.

### Mechanisms, evaluation, and management of chronic constipation [^376fa86b]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

With a worldwide prevalence of 15%, chronic constipation is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal diagnoses made in ambulatory medicine clinics, and is a common source cause for referrals to gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the United States. Symptoms vary among patients; straining, incomplete evacuation, and a sense of anorectal blockage are just as important as decreased stool frequency. Chronic constipation is either a primary disorder (such as normal transit, slow transit, or defecatory disorders) or a secondary one (due to medications or, in rare cases, anatomic alterations). Colonic sensorimotor disturbances and pelvic floor dysfunction (such as defecatory disorders) are the most widely recognized pathogenic mechanisms. Guided by efficacy and cost, management of constipation should begin with dietary fiber supplementation and stimulant and/or osmotic laxatives, as appropriate, followed, if necessary, by intestinal secretagogues and/or prokinetic agents. Peripherally acting μ-opiate antagonists are another option for opioid-induced constipation. Anorectal tests to evaluate for defecatory disorders should be performed in patients who do not respond to over-the-counter agents. Colonic transit, followed if necessary with assessment of colonic motility with manometry and/or a barostat, can identify colonic dysmotility. Defecatory disorders often respond to biofeedback therapy. For specific patients, slow-transit constipation may necessitate a colectomy. No studies have compared inexpensive laxatives with newer drugs with different mechanisms. We review the mechanisms, evaluation, and management of chronic constipation. We discuss the importance of meticulous analyses of patient history and physical examination, advantages and disadvantages of diagnostic testing, guidance for individualized treatment, and management of medically refractory patients.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^f918d75b]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Laboratory and structural evaluation — screening for secondary causes and initial management steps are outlined. A complete blood cell count should be performed. Although metabolic tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum glucose, creatinine, and calcium) are often performed, their diagnostic utility and cost-effectiveness have not been rigorously evaluated and are probably low. A structural evaluation of the colon may be appropriate in certain circumstances, especially if the patient has alarm symptoms or has not undergone age-appropriate screening for colon cancer, and colonoscopy, computed tomographic colonography, or flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema will effectively exclude lesions that could cause constipation. If this evaluation uncovers a secondary cause for constipation, the appropriate treatment can be offered, the patient's medications can be adjusted when possible to avoid those with constipating effects, and a trial of fiber and/or over-the-counter laxatives can be instituted.

### The evolution of magnetic resonance enterography in the assessment of motility disorders in children [^57483076]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms including constipation, diarrhoea, pain and bloating represent some of the most common clinical problems for patients. These symptoms can often be managed with cheap, widely available medication or will spontaneously resolve. However, for many patients, chronic GI symptoms persist and frequently come to dominate their lives. At one end of the spectrum there is Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with a clearly defined but expensive treatment pathway. Contrasting with this is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), likely a collection of pathologies, has a poorly standardised pathway with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Managing GI symptoms in adult populations is a challenge. The clinical burden of gastrointestinal disease is also prevalent in paediatric populations and perhaps even harder to treat. In this review we explore some of the recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the gastrointestinal tract. Complex in both its anatomical structure and its physiology we are likely missing key physiological markers of disease through relying on symptomatic descriptors of gut function. Using MRI we might be able to characterise previously opaque processes, such as non-propulsive contractility, that could lead to changes in how we understand even common symptoms like constipation. This review explores recent advances in the field in adult populations and examines how this safe, objective and increasingly available modality might be applied to paediatric populations.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^8f34a8eb]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — initial assessment and conservative measures emphasize that one of the first steps is to ensure the opioid indication is appropriate, participation in a pain management program, and use of the minimum necessary opioid dose; a suggested general approach includes careful history of bowel patterns, stool consistency, dysynergic symptoms, and alarm features, with other causes considered and excluded. Lifestyle modifications are an appropriate first step, including increasing fluid intake, moderate exercise as tolerated, and toileting promptly when urged. There may also be benefit in "opioid switching" to an equianalgesic dose of a less-constipating opioid; oral or parenteral morphine may induce more constipation than transdermal opioids, such as fentanyl. Combination opioid agonist/antagonist agents (eg, oxycodone + naloxone) are also associated with lower risk of constipation. Once OIC is confirmed and other causes excluded, the recommendations can guide appropriate evidence-based management.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^da8cf8cd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — epidemiology, risk factors, and classification are outlined as follows: Constipation is one of the most common GI disorders seen in ambulatory medicine clinics and is a common reason for referral to a colorectal surgeon. Constipation has a worldwide prevalence of 15% and is more frequently diagnosed in North America and Europe compared with Asia. Risk factors for constipation include age greater than 65 years, female sex, inactivity, low socioeconomic status, low-fiber diet, and non-White race. Constipation is characterized by dysfunctional colonic motility and/or outlet dysfunction, and primary constipation can be classified into 3 subtypes: constipation with normal transit, constipation with delayed transit time, and outlet dysfunction constipation. Constipation with normal transit time and irritable bowel syndrome with associated constipation (IBS-C) comprise a group of functional bowel disorders with several overlapping symptoms.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^928dcc43]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate timely evidence-based guidelines for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Setting

Constipation is a major untoward effect of opioids. Increasing prescription of opioids has correlated to increased incidence of opioid-induced constipation. However, the inhibitory effects of opioids are not confined to the colon, but also affect higher segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the coining of the term "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction".

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Predefined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to identify and categorize relevant papers. A series of statements were formulated and justified by a comment, then labeled with the degree of agreement and their level of evidence as judged by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) system.

Results

From a list of 10,832 potentially relevant studies, 33 citations were identified for review. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications. Current definitions, prevalence, and mechanism of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction were reviewed, and a treatment algorithm and statements regarding patient management were developed to provide guidance on clinical best practice in the management of patients with opioid-induced constipation and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Conclusions

In recent years, more insight has been gained in the pathophysiology of this "entity"; new treatment approaches have been developed, but guidelines on clinical best practice are still lacking. Current knowledge is insufficient regarding management of the opioid side effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, but recommendations can be derived from what we know at present.

### Management guidelines for low anterior resection syndrome-the MANUEL project [^0e5dfcb4]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Dissemination and future directions

LARS is a recognized problem worldwide that is caused by rectal cancer treatment and leads to severe impairment of HRQoL. The institutional recognition of the syndrome and, consequently, of the reimbursement for the available treatments, is variable among countries. Most clinicians treating patients with LARS are surgeons involved in rectal cancer treatment, but their knowledge about therapeutic solutions to deal with the specific problems is often poor and they may need help from other clinicians. Since the number of rectal cancer survivors has increased with the significant improvements in treatment and survival during the last decade, it is time for a paradigm shift in the follow‐up of colorectal cancer with increased focus on late adverse effects [79].

Although surgeons worldwide are informed about LARS by societies, congresses and the scientific literature, there are still large gaps in knowledge about the treatment of LARS. A limited number of randomized controlled trials for LARS, mainly carried out by surgeons, are available [75, 80, 81, 82] emphasizing the lack of sound evidence. The recommendation for the present guidance is therefore partly based on expert opinion. A potential treatment chart is provided in Figure 3.

FIGURE 3
A suggested treatment chart for patients with low anterior resection syndrome

An easy‐to‐use, step‐up treatment algorithm has been proposed [56], giving an overview of treatments available. Surgeons are specialists in treating rectal cancer but not always specialists in functional colorectal diseases and may need to seek help from other clinicians.

We may need to think of different approaches to the management of LARS, given the mixed aetiological factors underlying the condition (see Section I). As stated above, in current practice, LARS patients are often treated as one entity, but we could think of separate treatment pathways for faecal incontinence, clustering and constipation. It is imaginable that different pathways could be treated by different specialists and a multidisciplinary team is desirable. Multidisciplinary teams might avoid inappropriate treatments, and lead to tailored patient approach.

### Family-driven goals to improve care for children with autism spectrum disorder [^3944cec0]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Constipation and insomnia are not consistently identified and treated in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) despite their high prevalence and deleterious impact in this population. To standardize care, a constipation practice pathway and an insomnia practice pathway were previously developed by Autism Treatment Network clinicians. Our objective was to implement and refine these practice pathways in clinical settings.

Methods

Eleven Autism Treatment Network sites participated in a Learning Collaborative (ie, multidisciplinary quality improvement team) and chose to implement either the constipation or insomnia practice pathway in the clinical setting. Families set intervention goals (eg, increase stool frequency, decrease nighttime awakenings) before treatment. Each site began implementation with 1 patient and then increased implementation by factors of 5. Before each increase, the Learning Collaborative evaluated progress and refined the practice pathways. Process improvement was measured primarily by duration until goal attainment and by percentage of families who meet their goals.

Results

Across sites, 82 children with ASD and constipation and 101 children with ASD and insomnia were managed. Difficulties with intervention adherence and communication between providers and families were reported and were subsequently improved with parallel refinements to both practice pathways. The most notable modification was incorporating a goal-setting session in which families generated their own intervention goals (ie, family-driven goals). In this quality improvement initiative, 75% of families met at least 1 constipation or insomnia goal, with the median time to improvement being 6 weeks.

Conclusions

By integrating a family-centered approach into the standardization of care, constipation and insomnia practice pathways may improve engagement, adherence, and management of medical conditions in children with ASD.

### Perceptions, definitions, and therapeutic interventions for occasional constipation: a Rome working group consensus document [^cee358b1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Functional constipation is the most common of the disorders of gut-brain interaction, affecting approximately 12% of the world population. Although classically considered a chronic condition, many individuals experience shorter yet repetitive bouts of constipation representing a different clinical entity. There has been increased interest in this latter disorder, which has recently been classified as occasional constipation. This Rome Foundation working group document reflects the consensus of an international team of specialists who summarized currently available research to provide a working definition of and treatment algorithm for occasional constipation. The recommendations herein are based on current evidence, accounting for gaps in the literature as well as international variance in definitions and health seeking behaviors for constipation.

Methods

The committee members reviewed the scientific literature, focusing specifically on occasional constipation, with the understanding that as a new entity, a paucity of data would be available. We used Rome IV research and clinical definitions to establish the framework for our definition of occasional constipation. Where possible, treatment recommendations were determined on the basis of the earliest extractable data from functional constipation studies, focusing on positive results within the first 2 weeks of treatment. We used the Delphi method to create consensus with 100% agreement between the authors.

Results

An evidence-based review of the literature resulted in the definition of occasional constipation as follows: "individuals who experience the presence of at least 1 functional constipation symptom, in the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, occurring at irregular and infrequent intervals, which is bothersome enough to induce a patient to seek medical management". Medical management whether seeking medical care or self-treatment was left to the individual's discretion, and we did not include time anchors because these thresholds require further investigation. Polyethylene glycol and stimulant laxatives are recommended as first-line interventions, whereas magnesium-containing compounds are suggested in individuals failing to respond to these therapies. There are insufficient data to make recommendations for using fiber or stool softeners. Prescription laxatives should be reserved for individuals with chronic constipation.

Conclusions

Occasional constipation is a unique clinical entity characterized by infrequent but recurrent symptoms. Data are limited because consensus definitions have been lacking. Establishing a standardized definition and therapeutic recommendations provides a framework for future studies focusing on epidemiologic and symptoms-based outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm and refine these recommendations.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation [^5e502b32]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In contemporary society, constipation has emerged as a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder, significantly impairing patients' quality of life. Etiologically, chronic constipation is classified into primary and secondary forms, with functional constipation representing the predominant subtype of primary constipation. Functional constipation can be further divided into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation (STC), and defecatory disorders. Although STC does not represent the most prevalent subtype of functional constipation, its complex pathophysiological mechanisms and the considerable challenges associated with clinical management have increasingly attracted attention within the medical community in recent years. Due to its protracted course, therapeutic challenges, and refractory symptoms, slow transit constipation (STC) exerts a profound impact on patients' physical health while imposing substantial economic and psychological burdens. Given the complex pathophysiology of STC and its profound impact on patient quality of life and healthcare resources, advancing our understanding of its underlying mechanisms, refining diagnostic criteria, and optimizing therapeutic algorithms are of significant clinical and societal value.

This study aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms, refine diagnostic accuracy, and optimize therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation (STC). Through a comprehensive synthesis of current literature and integration of clinical experience, the investigation seeks to identify underlying etiological factors contributing to STC, establish more sensitive and specific biomarkers for early diagnosis, and enhance treatment protocols to improve patient quality of life. Furthermore, this study holds substantial significance for advancing the understanding of STC and fostering the development of the field.

### Using best practice to create a pathway to improve management of irritable bowel syndrome: aiming for timely diagnosis, effective treatment and equitable care [^49584606]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating condition, which places a significant burden on the National Health Service (NHS), both in terms of financial cost and strain on primary and secondary care. The total attributable cost of IBS in the UK was almost £12 million per annum in 2012–2013. Despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines recommending that IBS management should take place within primary care, a significant proportion of patients aged 16–45 years with likely IBS are still referred to secondary care despite a low probability of pathology. Research suggests that general practitioners (GP) still see IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion often due to uncertainty about diagnosis and in the belief that negative diagnostic tests are useful. Overall demands for inpatient and outpatient diagnostic endoscopies are increasing steadily. Hence, better GP education around diagnosis of IBS within primary care, along with an effective management pathway, should lead to direct NHS savings, which would allow secondary care gastroenterology services to target their resources more effectively.

### Chronic severe constipation: current pathophysiological aspects, new diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options [^c1031445]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a considerable problem because it significantly affects the quality of a patient's life. Constipation can be diagnosed at every age and is more frequent in women and among the elderly. In epidemiological studies, its incidence is estimated at 2–27% in the general population. Chronic constipation may be primary or secondary. However, primary constipation (functional or idiopathic) can be classified into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation, and pelvic outlet obstruction. In this review we make an attempt to present the current pathophysiological aspects and new therapeutic options for chronic idiopathic constipation, particularly highlighting the value of patient assessment for accurate diagnosis of the cause of the problem, thus helping in the choice of appropriate treatment.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^325f2b83]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation — recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional," with "we recommend" indicating strong and "we suggest" indicating conditional. For patients, under a strong recommendation "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not," whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not." For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while under a conditional recommendation "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with his or her values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences." For policy makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations," whereas conditional recommendations state "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate." Certainty of evidence definitions include "High" ("We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect."), "Moderate" ("We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different."), and "Low" ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect."). For all recommendations, "the intervention is compared with 'not using the intervention' or the treatment is recommended or suggested 'over no drug treatment'.The comparator is not explicitly included in the recommendation statement to avoid redundancy."

### Development of an early nurse led intervention to treat children referred to secondary paediatric care with constipation with or without soiling [^660e2825]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have developed a nurse-led intervention for children who have failed primary care treatment for constipation. This development is in line with the evidence based medicine philosophy established by Sackett. The intervention is practical when used in a deprived inner city and should transfer to other settings. If effective and cost-effective it will change the standard care pathway for children with constipation, from a GP referring to a Paediatrician who may eventually refer treatment resistant cases to a Nurse-led service if one exists, to a GP referring to a Nurse-led service supported by a Paediatrician. The intervention is similar to IMPACT but is designed to utilise psychological practices particularly self-help. Self-help will enable parents to provide early effective intervention supported by a nurse-led team. The aim is to stop children's constipation becoming treatment resistant. This will reduce both health service costs and the devastating effects of soiling on children and their families. A postgraduate course needs to be developed to teach the intervention which then needs to be subjected to the rigors of a definitive randomised controlled trial. This will fulfil a research recommendation made by the NICE guideline development group.

### Chronic constipation in adults [^3f5b3028]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic constipation has significant quality-of-life implications. Modifiable risk factors include insufficient physical activity, depression, decreased caloric intake, and aggravating medication use. Chronic constipation is classified as primary (normal transit, slow transit, defecatory disorders, or a combination) or secondary (due to medications, chronic diseases, or anatomic abnormalities). Evaluation begins with a detailed history, medication reconciliation, and physical examination. Routine use of laboratory studies or imaging, including colonoscopy, is not recommended in the absence of alarm symptoms. Patients with alarm symptoms or who are overdue for colorectal cancer screening should be referred for colonoscopy. First-line treatment for primary constipation includes ensuring adequate fluid intake, dietary fiber supplementation, and osmotic laxatives. Second-line therapy includes a brief trial of stimulant laxatives followed by intestinal secretagogues. If the initial treatment approach is ineffective, patients should be referred to gastroenterology for more specialized testing, such as anorectal manometry and a balloon expulsion test. Patients with refractory constipation may be considered for surgery. Those in whom pelvic floor dysfunction is identified early should be referred for pelvic floor therapy with biofeedback while first-line medications, such as bulk or osmotic laxatives, are initiated.

Fig. 2
The diagnose and treatment of STC. STC, Slow Transit Constipation

Key points in clinical symptom assessment

Clinical symptom assessment constitutes a pivotal component in the diagnostic algorithm for slow transit constipation (STC). In current clinical practice, the diagnosis of STC is primarily guided by the diagnostic framework for functional constipation as delineated in the Rome III or Rome IV criteria. However, it is critical to note that these criteria do not adequately capture the pathognomonic feature of STC — namely, prolonged colonic transit time. Therefore, the clinical diagnostic process should emphasize: (1) identification of characteristic symptoms, with particular attention to those indicative of colonic dysmotility; (2) interpretation of ancillary test results, especially objective evidence from colonic transit studies; and (3) comprehensive history-taking to elucidate disease course and associated symptoms. This multidimensional assessment paradigm is essential for the accurate diagnosis of STC and for distinguishing it from other constipation subtypes, such as defecatory outlet obstruction.

Analysis of typical symptoms

The most salient clinical feature of STC is a marked reduction in defecation frequency. Epidemiological data indicate that healthy individuals typically maintain a "3 + 3" bowel habit (no more than three times daily, at least three times weekly, i.e. > 21 times per month), whereas most STC patients fall below the threshold of three bowel movements per week. Notably, clinical observations reveal that a defecation frequency of approximately 5.6 times per week may still be consistent with an STC diagnosis, underscoring the heterogeneity of the disorder. This decline in frequency directly reflects severe impairment of colonic transit: prolonged intraluminal stool retention (usually > 72 h) leads to excessive water reabsorption and the formation of desiccated, hard stools. Concurrently, the accumulation of luminal contents results in the retention of deleterious metabolic byproducts, which, via the gut-brain axis, further suppress colonic motility and perpetuate a progressive vicious cycle. This pathophysiological cascade not only alters stool consistency Bristol Stool Form Scale types 1–2 (hard, lumpy stools) but also constitutes the mechanistic substrate for the clinical manifestations of STC.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^9b9af0f4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. Evidence for the efficacy of some of the older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, which is attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side-effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and are not sufficiently current to include treatments that became available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

Purpose

We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, current management and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation, and include recent data on the efficacy and potential clinical use of the more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded and then diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2024 protocol for paediatric functional constipation treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure) [^b8aa48d1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional constipation is common in childhood, with chronicity leading to a significant impact on patients and their families. There is a significant range of therapies available to healthcare professionals for this condition, with many novel or recently studied. There is a need for an update to the joint European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)/North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines last released in 2014. We present the prospectively agreed operating procedure and technical review protocol in this manuscript.

Methods

'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) will be used for all phases of this guideline development. The Guideline Development Group is formed by paediatric gastroenterologists from both the ESPGHAN as well as the NASPGHAN. A prospective exercise will agree on key outcomes, thresholds of magnitude that are significant at small, moderate and large levels. Systematic evidence searches, selection, extraction, appraisal and analysis will be performed following Cochrane guidance and GRADE guidance for objectively agreeing the certainty of findings. Additional use of network meta-analysis will identify areas of broad triangulation in the evidence. Summary of findings tables will be produced and inform evidence to decision frameworks. These will guide GRADE recommendations with voting to reach a consensus.

### Chronic constipation: overview and challenges [^7ae8da84]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2009). Low credibility.

Despite its high prevalence and cost implications, our understanding of the pathophysiology of constipation remains primitive, and available therapies have limited efficacy. The purpose of this supplement is to address critically the reasons for the current lack of understanding and to propose avenues of future research to address these deficiencies.

### Do the symptom-based, Rome criteria of irritable bowel syndrome lead to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes? The con argument [^7ef9a650]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Some claim that symptom-based Rome criteria are diagnostic and enhance clinical practice and choice of therapy for patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. This overview focuses on lower gastrointestinal symptoms: constipation, diarrhea, pain and bloating. The main con arguments for using such criteria for diagnosis are: insufficient specificity, overlap of symptom-based categories or disorders, insufficient and therefore non-specific characterization of pain in the criteria, inability to differentiate the "mimics" of IBS-C and IBS-D, and inability to optimize treatment for IBS-M or bloating in the absence of objective measurements. While doctors may not land in trouble using "symptom diagnosis" of IBS, this should not deter them from optimizing diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

### Chronic constipation: new diagnostic and treatment approaches [^f6551c88]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a highly prevalent disorder that affects approximately 15% of the US population. Chronic constipation refers to patients who have had symptoms for more than 6 months. In clinical practice, chronic constipation is often used interchangeably with the term functional constipation. This is best defined using the Rome III criteria, which involves an evaluation of stool frequency in addition to symptoms of straining, feelings of incomplete evacuation, and the need to use manual maneuvers to assist with stool evacuation. Symptoms can be burdensome, leading to a reduction in patients' quality of life. As a national healthcare issue, chronic constipation is also important because it imposes a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. A number of treatment options are currently available, both over-the-counter and by prescription, although not all patients respond to these therapies. This review will focus on new medical treatment options for the management of chronic constipation, and the safety and efficacy of these agents will be reviewed. In addition, the efficacy of new diagnostic tests to evaluate colonic motility and anorectal function are described.

### Focus on pharmacotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^35e28f28]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is a common disorder that significantly impairs quality of life. There are now multiple classes of therapeutics that have been shown via rigorous clinical testing to improve the abdominal and bowel symptoms attributed to irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. These include the secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide, tenapenor) and the prokinetic agent tegaserod. This article highlights the pivotal evidence for these agents and most recent treatment guidance from the major North American gastroenterological societies. When pharmaceuticals are used, a patient-specific approach based on efficacy, safety, tolerability, access, and affordability is recommended.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^74eab76e]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Substantial progress has been made in treating cancer. However, there are convincing and consistent data that large numbers of people have chronic physical morbidity after cancer treatment which commonly affects the GI tract and impacts adversely on daily activities. There is a professional obligation to identify systematically patients with such unmet needs and to develop appropriate referral pathways where they do not currently exist.

This multidisciplinary guidance is designed to help those clinicians who wish to understand better the underlying pathology and current management options for physical symptoms. It is hoped that it may form the starting point for multidisciplinary team discussions to enhance care for these patients and for educational programmes for trainees who need to know how to manage these issues. Systematic education about the optimal management of severely symptomatic patients is sorely lacking, despite the fact that the number of affected patients in the UK currently equals the number of patients diagnosed annually with primary inflammatory bowel disease, and is increasing by 3% per year. This patient group can undoubtedly gain substantial benefit from a more coherent approach to care for their ongoing and often disabling and distressing symptoms.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^43ba3542]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

Initial Clinical Considerations Related to Diagnosis and Prophylactic and First‐Line Interventions

Although this consensus article is not intended to provide specific treatment recommendations, we highlight the need to consider selected factors before evaluating whether treatment with OIC prescription medication is warranted. In anticipation of potential OIC development with long‐term opioid use, treatment guidelines recommend initiation of a prophylactic bowel regimen that may involve increased fluid and fiber intake, stool softeners, and/or laxatives 16, 17, 72. When a diagnosis of OIC is suspected despite prophylactic treatment, clinicians should confirm that initiation of opioid therapy has led to a change from baseline in the patient's typical bowel habits, as defined by Camilleri et al. 3, before consideration of further or alternative interventions. First‐line approaches to intervention also include dietary changes and OTC treatments as well as exercise 16, 17. However, prophylactic and first‐line OTC therapies for OIC may not consistently and predictably lead to desired treatment responses 15, 46, and the number and quality of OIC studies of such therapies are inadequate to determine their efficacy and tolerability 13. Nevertheless, the panel believes that the accessibility and relatively low risk of dietary and OTC options justify their prophylactic and first‐line use for OIC.

Enemas/rectal suppositories and manual evacuation, which are sometimes recommended for patients with constipation 72, are associated with invasiveness, discomfort, embarrassment, and health care burdens. Rectal procedures have been described as painful and traumatic for patients and may lead to complications such as rectal bleeding or bowel perforation, especially in patients who have thrombocytopenia or are receiving anticoagulation therapy 19, 73, 74. For manual evacuation, competent practitioners should be involved in cautious execution and only when absolutely necessary 19, 73, 75, 76 after OTC and prescription therapies have been exhausted. Particular caution is required to avoid invasive options in patients who are immunocompromised because of the risk of producing a systemic infection 19, 73, 75. The health care burden and costs of enemas and manual evacuation are reflected in results from a palliative care study showing that the total health care staff time spent on these processes was higher than time spent on most other tasks related to the management of constipation (e.g. oral laxative administration, discussions of bowel care) 76.

### Surgery for constipation: systematic review and practice recommendations: graded practice and future research recommendations [^9ceb7568]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

This manuscript forms the final of seven that address the surgical management of chronic constipation (CC) in adults. The content coalesces results from the five systematic reviews that precede it and of the European Consensus process to derive graded practice recommendations (GPR).

Methods

Summary of review data, development of GPR and future research recommendations as outlined in detail in the 'introduction and methods' paper.

Results

The overall quality of data in the five reviews was poor with 113/156(72.4%) of included studies providing only level IV evidence and only four included level I RCTs. Coalescence of data from the five procedural classes revealed that few firm conclusions could be drawn regarding procedural choice or patient selection: no single procedure dominated in addressing dynamic structural abnormalities of the anorectum and pelvic floor with each having similar overall efficacy. Of one hundred 'prototype' GPRs developed by the clinical guideline group, 85/100 were deemed 'appropriate' based on the independent scoring of a panel of 18 European experts and use of RAND-UCLA consensus methodology. The remaining 15 were all deemed uncertain. Future research recommendations included some potential RCTs but also a strong emphasis on delivery of large multinational high-quality prospective cohort studies.

Conclusion

While the evidence base for surgery in CC is poor, the widespread European consensus for GPRs is encouraging. Professional bodies have the opportunity to build on this work by supporting the efforts of their membership to help convert the documented recommendations into clinical guidelines.
