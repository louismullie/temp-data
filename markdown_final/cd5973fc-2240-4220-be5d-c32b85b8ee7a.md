## Question

Is pentaprazole safe to take on cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascitis patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pantoprazole is safe to use in patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites, and how to weigh benefits versus risks in this setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and labeled dosing in hepatic impairment. Then, I should verify infection-related safety signals, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and Clostridioides difficile. Next, I will review guideline positions on proton pump inhibitors in cirrhosis and ascites. After that, I need to consider disease-stage nuances, including compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and deprescribing strategies.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and basic pharmacology. Wait, let me verify the spelling: the question says "pentaprazole", but I should confirm that we are discussing pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor with delayed-release oral and intravenous formulations, which are the forms most commonly used in clinical practice.

> I need to check the regulatory labeling regarding hepatic impairment. The FDA labeling for pantoprazole states that no dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment, including Child-Pugh A and B, and notes that doses above 40 mg/day have not been studied in hepatic impairment, which means caution is warranted at higher doses even though no explicit adjustment is mandated [^1135cqfY] [^11168WX8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety just because no dose change is required. I should review infection-related risks that are particularly relevant in cirrhosis with ascites. Multiple observational studies and meta-analyses associate chronic PPI use with increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis, with odds ratios around 2–3, and there is also a signal for increased Clostridioides difficile infection, although much of the evidence is retrospective and confounded [^115iFx3W] [^1155S9N7].

> Next, I should review what major guidelines say. The EASL guidance advises restricting PPIs to patients with a clear indication because they may increase the risk of SBP, especially in those with prior SBP, which is a key caution in ascites. The BSG guidance similarly recommends not using PPIs for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease, reinforcing a restrictive approach in portal hypertension. AASLD guidance does not directly endorse chronic PPI use for portal hypertensive complications either, aligning with a conservative stance outside specific indications [^1116Sdbm] [^114bgqok] [^114XgFns] [^117QHK91].

> Let me consider disease-stage nuances. In compensated cirrhosis without ascites, short-term PPI therapy for a clear acid-related indication is generally acceptable pharmacologically, though I should still avoid chronic, indefinite use when possible. In decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, the threshold should be higher, and chronic PPIs should be avoided unless there is a compelling indication such as active peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, or ulcerations after variceal banding, where short courses may be justified [^1116Sdbm] [^114bgqok] [^1155S9N7].

> But wait, what about acute variceal hemorrhage. I should double-check the acute care guidance. In critically ill patients with portal hypertensive bleeding, expert guidance recommends short-course PPI therapy as part of standard care to reduce rebleeding risk, even though mortality is not consistently impacted, and this is a distinct, time-limited indication where benefits outweigh theoretical infection risks in the acute setting [^112jy31G] [^114UhA4F].

> I will now examine deprescribing data to ensure I am not overstating harms. An emulated trial using Medicare data suggested that deprescribing PPIs in compensated cirrhosis was associated with less ascites and less encephalopathy, and that cumulative PPI exposure correlated with more complications, although a high proportion restarted therapy, underscoring the need for symptom alternatives and sustained deprescribing support [^117BA27n].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If pantoprazole is indicated for a clear acid-related disease, using the lowest effective dose, typically 20–40 mg daily, for the shortest duration is reasonable even in hepatic impairment, with no dose adjustment per label, while acknowledging that doses above 40 mg/day have not been studied in hepatic impairment. If there is no valid indication, I should avoid initiation, and if the patient is already on a PPI chronically, I should attempt deprescribing with alternative symptom management and close follow-up, especially in those with ascites or prior SBP [^1135cqfY] [^1116Sdbm] [^117BA27n].

> I should confirm monitoring steps. In patients with ascites who require PPIs, I need to ensure vigilant surveillance for infection, including a low threshold to evaluate for SBP with diagnostic paracentesis when symptoms, labs, or clinical status change, and to maintain awareness of C. difficile risk. If deprescribing is attempted, I should provide alternatives for dyspepsia and reflux and arrange reassessment to prevent automatic restart without indication [^114z9Mzw] [^112asWWU] [^117BA27n].

> In summary, pantoprazole is not absolutely contraindicated in cirrhosis with portal hypertension and ascites, but chronic use should be avoided unless there is a compelling acid-related indication because of increased risks of SBP and C. difficile, and short-term use at standard doses is acceptable when clearly indicated, with deprescribing favored whenever feasible [^1116Sdbm] [^1155S9N7] [^1135cqfY].

Pantoprazole is **generally safe** for patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites when used at standard doses (≤ 40 mg/day) [^1135cqfY] and for clear indications, as no dose adjustment is required in hepatic impairment [^11168WX8]. However, **long-term or high-dose use** should be avoided due to increased risks of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [^115iFx3W], Clostridioides difficile infection [^115iFx3W], and hepatic encephalopathy [^117BA27n]. Use the lowest effective dose, reassess regularly, and stop therapy if no longer indicated [^117QHK91].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and hepatic metabolism

Pantoprazole is **metabolized primarily by hepatic CYP2C19 and CYP3A4**, with minimal renal excretion. In hepatic impairment, exposure increases modestly (~1.5–2-fold), but no dose adjustment is required for Child-Pugh A or B [^1135cqfY]; data for Child-Pugh C are limited, so caution is advised [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on safety in cirrhosis

Overall, pantoprazole is **well tolerated in cirrhosis**, including patients with portal hypertension and ascites. Key safety considerations include:

- **Infection risk**: Chronic PPI use is associated with increased risks of SBP [^115iFx3W], C. difficile [^115iFx3W], and other infections in cirrhosis, likely via altered gut microbiota and bacterial overgrowth [^1155S9N7].

- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Observational data suggest PPI use correlates with encephalopathy, possibly via dysbiosis and increased ammonia absorption [^1155S9N7].

- **Renal effects**: PPIs may increase AKI risk in cirrhosis, though data are mixed and confounded.

---

## Guideline recommendations

Guidelines advise **restricting PPI use to clear indications** (e.g. peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, variceal ulcer healing) and avoiding routine prophylaxis in cirrhosis [^114bgqok]. For ascites, use the lowest effective dose and reassess regularly; stop if no longer indicated [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Short-term use (≤ 8 weeks) for clear indication (e.g. ulcer, esophagitis) | Safe at standard doses (≤ 40 mg/day) [^1135cqfY] |
| Long-term use (> 8 weeks) without clear indication | Avoid due to infection and encephalopathy risks [^115iFx3W] [^1155S9N7] |
| Acute variceal bleeding | Short-term PPI use (≤ 7 days) is reasonable to promote ulcer healing [^1155S9N7] |
| Refractory ascites or recurrent SBP | Avoid or minimize PPI use; consider alternative therapies [^1116Sdbm] |

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Monitor**: Watch for infection (SBP, C. difficile), encephalopathy, and renal dysfunction.

- **Reassess**: Regularly review the need for continued PPI therapy.

- **Dose**: Use the lowest effective dose; avoid doses > 40 mg/day in hepatic impairment [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapies

For dyspepsia or reflux, consider **H2 receptor antagonists** or non-pharmacologic measures (diet, head-of-bed elevation). For ulcer prevention after variceal banding, limit PPIs to short courses and taper off promptly [^1155S9N7].

---

Pantoprazole is **safe at standard doses** for cirrhosis with portal hypertension and ascites when indicated, but **long-term or high-dose use** should be avoided due to infection and encephalopathy risks. Use the lowest effective dose, reassess regularly, and stop if no longer indicated [^1116Sdbm].

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

### Beta-blockers in patients with advanced liver disease: has the dust settled? [^111ssQ22]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) have been the backbone for the treatment of portal hypertension in cirrhosis for the last 3 decades. A publication in 2010 of a prospective observational study suggested that NSBBs could increase mortality in patients with refractory ascites. This opened a controversy about the safety and efficacy of NSBBs in patients with advanced liver disease and led to the publication of a large corpus of observational data assessing the safety of NSBBs in patients with advanced cirrhosis. In this article, we briefly review the clinical pharmacology of NSBBs, the pathophysiological basis for the underlying benefits and harms of NSBBs in advanced cirrhosis, and the evidence in favor and against the use of NSBBs in specific scenarios. Finally, we summarize the current recommendations and propose areas of opportunity for future research. Liver Transplantation 23 1058–1069 2017 AASLD.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115DLCxT]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis — staging and guidance statements: Cirrhosis should be described, analyzed, and managed in two distinct clinical stages, compensated and decompensated, defined by the presence or absence of overt clinical complications of cirrhosis (ascites, VH, and HE). Patients with compensated cirrhosis should be substaged into those with mild PH and those with CSPH, with mild PH defined as HVPG > 5 but < 10 mm Hg and CSPH defined by an HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg; Patients with CSPH are substaged into those with and without GEV, and patients with GEV have an HVPG of at least 10 mm Hg. Treatment of PH differs depending on the stage and substages of cirrhosis, because prognosis and mechanisms of disease (and therefore therapeutic targets) are different.

### Care of the cirrhotic patient [^114sQhYt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of cirrhotic liver disease encompass a broad spectrum of conditions that reflect the consequence of high portal pressures that result from fibrosis and diminished hepatic synthetic reserve. Patients with cirrhosis are at heightened risk for the development of infection, and although the use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy may be considered lifesaving in the setting of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, there remains controversy regarding such therapy in the management of cirrhotic ascites. The infectious disease specialist is now becoming familiarized with the management of viral hepatitis, which includes screening for hepatocellular carcinoma and vigilance for infectious complications of antiviral therapy.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^1173qCU4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis consists of two main stages: compensated (asymptomatic) and decompensated, the latter with a higher mortality. Variceal hemorrhage, together with ascites or encephalopathy, or both, are events that define cirrhosis decompensation and are driven by portal hypertension. The approach and management of patients with compensated cirrhosis has been mostly focused on preventing variceal hemorrhage in those who have high-risk varices on endoscopy. Recent studies suggest a paradigm shift aimed at preventing all decompensating events, not only variceal hemorrhage, in patients with cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension identified via noninvasive measures such as liver stiffness and platelet count. In these patients, nonselective beta-blockers have been shown to prevent ascites (the most common decompensating event) and variceal growth. Variceal hemorrhage has a high mortality rate and even though advances in diagnostic approach and standard of care over the past decades have led to a decrease in mortality, it is still high with a 6-week mortality rate of 15–20%. Survival has improved with the preemptive placement of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients at high risk of failing standard therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology and bases for therapy of portal hypertension and varices, the diagnostic approach and management of compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension, and the management of acute variceal hemorrhage as well as prevention strategies for variceal hemorrhage recurrence.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites (correction of hyponatremia), AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to administer vasopressin receptor antagonists with caution and only for a short term (≤ 30 days) in patients with cirrhosis, because these agents can raise serum sodium during treatment.

### Preventing the development of varices in cirrhosis [^113W2wPe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are a direct consequence of portal hypertension. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and are effective in preventing variceal hemorrhage. However, a large multicenter placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are not effective in preventing the development of varices and are associated with a significant rate of adverse events. This therapy is, therefore, not recommended in compensated cirrhotic patients without varices at large. In this very compensated group of patients with cirrhosis (stage 1, ie, without varices and without ascites or encephalopathy) the predictive value (both for the development of varices and for the development of clinical decompensation) of a baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg is confirmed, supporting this threshold level as one that defines a clinically significant portal hypertension. Importantly, reductions in hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10% are associated with a significant reduction in the development of varices, a therapeutic goal that could be achieved through the use of beta-blockers or other drugs being developed for the treatment of portal hypertension.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1137iGgE]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) but without gastroesophageal varices (GEV) is defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) thresholds, as "CSPH is defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg", and in this group "the objective of treatment should no longer be to prevent varices, but to prevent clinical decompensation". For risk assessment, "a decrease in HVPG > 10% from baseline identified patients unlikely to develop varices", and "reduction or maintenance of HVPG to levels below 12 mm Hg likely prevents patients from developing VH and ascites". Regarding therapy, "Drugs that will decrease intrahepatic resistance and/or decrease splanchnic blood flow are reasonable at this stage", but "There is no evidence at present to recommend the use of NSBBs in preventing formation of varices".

### Proton pump inhibitor use and association with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^115iFx3W]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) when they are used in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-May 2012) and Web of Science (1990-May 2012) with the terms proton pump inhibitor, antisecretory therapy, cirrhosis, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and Clostridium difficile. The search was restricted to articles published in English on the use of PPIs in humans. Reference citations from identified published articles were reviewed for relevant information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated for inclusion. One case series, 8 retrospective case-control trials, and 1 meta-analysis were identified.

Data Synthesis

Cirrhosis may cause complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. Patients may be prescribed PPIs without clear indications or because of their propensity to develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding. However, gastric acidity is a major nonspecific defense mechanism and there is insufficient evidence on the need for chronic acid suppression in patients with cirrhosis. It is postulated that the portal hypertensive environment in cirrhosis and the acid suppression from PPIs can increase the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and C. difficile infection in patients with cirrhosis with ascites. Several retrospective studies and 1 meta-analysis have confirmed this association.

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should be monitored carefully while on PPIs for a possible increased risk of infection from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and C. difficile. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm this association. Clinicians should be aware of this lesser known adverse effect of PPIs.

Naltrexone, 50 mg daily Cholestyramine: efficacy data from trials enrolling people with cirrhosis are lacking but considered first-line therapy given safety Naltrexone: placebo-controlled RCT of 16 patients followed up for 4 wk; naltrexone significantly improved pruritus as measured by a 100-mm VAS of pruritus severity with a mean 54% reduction from baseline compared with an 8% with placebo. Combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics: hyperkalemia, kidney injury Aldosterone antagonists alone: hyperkalemia, kidney injury Not reported in trials of patients with ascites but observed in other trials of spironolactone: gynecomastia.

Not observed in trials Rare adverse events may include weight gain, loose stool, and hair thinning Not reported in meta-analysis Prednisone is associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, rash, cataracts, infection risk, and osteoporosis Azathioprine is associated with leukopenia, pancreatitis, nonmelanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and increased infection risk. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma each year, which is associated with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%. In a 3-year randomized clinical trial of 201 patients with portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers reduced the risk of decompensation or death compared with placebo. Conclusions and Relevance Approximately 2. 2 million US adults have cirrhosis. Many symptoms, such as muscle cramps, poor-quality sleep, pruritus, and sexual dysfunction, are common and treatable.

First-line therapies include carvedilol or propranolol to prevent variceal bleeding, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics for ascites, and terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. Disrupted portal flow causes decreased cardiac return and decreased central blood volume, leading to increased plasma renin activity, increased renal-tubular affinity for sodium, peripheral volume expansion, and kidney vasoconstriction, predisposing patients to ascites, hyponatremia, and kidney injury, particularly in the setting of volume depletion, infection, or hemorrhage.

Preoperative transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for portal hypertension — In patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with alternative indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS; e.g., refractory ascites), we suggest preoperative TIPS to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality attributable to portal hypertension (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Propensity-matched analyses reported lower postoperative acute-on-chronic liver failure with preoperative TIPS (9% vs 29% at 28 days, P = 0.02) and lower in-hospital mortality in primarily chest and abdominal surgeries (19% vs 40%, P = 0.003). Among preoperative TIPS, 41% were for preoperative risk reduction, 38% for refractory ascites, and 9% after variceal hemorrhage. Another matched study reported increased hazard of postoperative mortality with preoperative TIPS when matched on data 6 months before surgery (hazard ratio 2.69, 95% CI 1.37–5.30, P = 0.004).

Hepatologists face dilemmas in clinical practice concerning the management of cirrhotic patients with PVT. To treat or not to treat with anticoagulant agents, what is the least hazardous treatment option in PVT, or the optimal dose, and for how long should it be administered, taking into consideration the bleeding risk in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension? All these questions become more critical in patients awaiting transplantation. Definitive answers concerning the impact of PVT and its prognostic effect on cirrhosis outcome are still needed.

### Varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a new view of an old problem [^1129v9fH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of portal hypertension in cirrhosis has evolved over time, leading to improvements in the care and survival of patients with varices and variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients who achieve a significant reduction in portal pressure. In addition to better treatment strategies and improved therapeutic options, the issue of risk stratification has become essential to identify different patient subpopulations that require a different treatment. We now recognize that the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage must be taken in the context of other complications of cirrhosis (ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice) and that the goals of therapy should be based on the presence of such complications. Evolving knowledge of the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms at each of the stages of cirrhosis also has evolved and will continue to lead to improvements in therapy. This review focuses on the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage with respect to refinements in the risk stratification of patients with cirrhosis.

Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis — AASLD practice guidance purpose and scope — provides a data-supported approach for risk stratification, diagnosis, and management in cirrhosis and portal hypertension (PH), clarifying that a guidance document is different from a guideline and that "guidance statements, not recommendations, are put forward to help clinicians understand and implement the most recent evidence". The focus is on PH, varices, and variceal hemorrhage (VH), with statements based on "review of the recent literature using PubMed, giving more weight to large, well-designed, prospective trials and well-performed meta-analyses" and on "the authors' years of experience caring for patients with cirrhosis and varices". Management of ascites and encephalopathy is addressed in other documents.

Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) in decompensated cirrhosis with refractory ascites or after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis — current observational evidence does not support a harmful effect in most patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and in these patients the dose should be carefully titrated; in refractory ascites or SBP, high doses should be avoided and the dose should be reduced or discontinued with severe circulatory dysfunction such as severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L), or unexplained deterioration in renal function. NSBBs might be reintroduced after correction of renal function/ circulatory state, and refractory ascites and SBP are not absolute contraindications for treatment with NSBBs; in these patients, high doses of NSBBs (over 160 mg/day of propranolol or over 80 mg/day of nadolol) should be avoided, given that they might be associated with worse outcomes.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — risk factors and screening: Best Practice Advice 1 states that "Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT", and risk factors for PVT in cirrhosis include portal hypertension, slow portal flow, metabolic syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are no symptoms specific to PVT in patients with compensated cirrhosis; it is reasonable, however, to perform Doppler ultrasound to evaluate for PVT if evidence of unexplained worsening portal hypertension (worsening varices, new or progressive ascites) is seen. Transplantation candidates should be evaluated for PVT as part of the transplantation evaluation, a multiphase, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can evaluate for both hepatocellular carcinoma and PVT in the same setting, and symptoms of new-onset abdominal pain should prompt evaluation for acute symptomatic PVT; recurrent PVT is pragmatically defined as occurring within the last 6 months based on data that lack of recanalization within 6 months is unlikely to respond to anticoagulation.

Routinely monitor patients for progression of PBC, including hepatic adverse reactions, with laboratory and clinical assessments to determine whether drug discontinuation is needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease), and/or with severe intercurrent illness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above the upper limit of normal in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, or prothrombin time to determine whether drug discontinuation is needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Permanently discontinue OCALIVA in patients who:

develop laboratory or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, jaundice, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy) [see Contraindications (4)].
have compensated cirrhosis and develop evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) [see Contraindications (4)].
experience clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions.
develop complete biliary obstruction [see Contraindications (4)].

If severe intercurrent illness occurs, interrupt treatment with OCALIVA and monitor the patient's liver function. After resolution of the intercurrent illness, consider the potential risks and benefits of restarting OCALIVA treatment.

### TIPS prevents further decompensation and improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension in an individual patient data meta-analysis [^115eHQce]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Further decompensation represents a prognostic stage of cirrhosis associated with higher mortality compared with first decompensation. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is indicated to prevent variceal rebleeding and for refractory ascites, but its overall efficacy to prevent further decompensations is unknown. This study assessed the incidence of further decompensation and mortality after TIPS vs. standard of care (SOC).

Methods

Controlled studies assessing covered TIPS compared with SOC for the indication of refractory ascites and prevention of variceal rebleeding published from 2004 to 2020 were considered. We collected individual patient data (IPD) to perform an IPD meta-analysis and to compare the treatment effect in a propensity score (PS)-matched population. Primary outcome was the incidence of further decompensation and the secondary outcome was overall survival.

Results

In total, 3,949 individual patient data sets were extracted from 12 controlled studies and, after PS matching, 2,338 patients with similar characteristics (SOC = 1,749; TIPS = 589) were analysed. The 2-year cumulative incidence function of further decompensation in the PS-matched population was 0.48 (95% CI 0.43–0.52) in the TIPS group vs. 0.63 (95% CI 0.61–0.65) in the SOC group (stratified Gray's test, p < 0.0001), considering mortality and liver transplantation as competing events. The lower further decompensation rate with TIPS was confirmed by adjusted IPD meta-analysis (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.37–0.54) and was consistent across TIPS indication subgroups. The 2-year cumulative survival probability was higher with TIPS than with SOC (0.71 vs. 0.63; p = 0.0001).

Conclusions

The use of TIPS for refractory ascites and for prevention of variceal rebleeding reduces the incidence of a further decompensation event compared with SOC and increases survival in highly selected patients.

Impact and Implications

A further decompensation (new or worsening ascites, variceal bleeding or rebleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Besides the known role of TIPS in portal hypertension-related complications, this study shows that TIPS is also able to decrease the overall risk of a further decompensation and increase survival compared with standard of care. These results further support the role of TIPS in the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications.

### An emulated clinical trial of deprescribing proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis [^117BA27n]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are overused and carry harms in cirrhosis. Deprescribing is advocated but has not been trialed.

Methods and Findings

We emulated a clinical trial using Medicare data. All patients were receiving chronic PPI therapy before a compensated cirrhosis diagnosis. We compared the risk death/decompensation over 3 years between continuous users and deprescribers. We find that PPI deprescription is associated with less ascites and that cumulative PPI use is associated with more ascites and encephalopathy. Ultimately, 71% of deprescribers restart PPIs.

Discussion

PPI deprescribing has benefits but requires ongoing support and alternative therapies for gastrointestinal symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115Lekho]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

5.2	Risk of Hepatic Decompensation/Failure in Patients with Evidence of Advanced Liver Disease

Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including treatment with VOSEVI. Reported cases occurred in patients with baseline cirrhosis with and without moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease such as portal hypertension, perform hepatic laboratory testing as clinically indicated; and monitor for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue VOSEVI in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure.

VOSEVI is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Evaluating clinical outcomes and prognosis in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension: a retrospective observational cohort study [^112YD848]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Our analysis of data from a large collection of electronic healthcare records represents robust evidence on the outcomes and mortality of patients with diagnosed/suspected portal hypertension. Despite use of beta blockers and surveillance endoscopy with variceal banding in modern care, morbidity and mortality remain high both in patients with more and less severe disease states, that is, those with and without variceal haemorrhage. A renewed effort is required to manage patients with portal hypertension using existing treatment strategies but also by developing new therapies, particularly with respect to reducing the risk of variceal haemorrhage and worsening of ascites.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^113t32Zc]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

The most significant changes 'relate to (1) recognition of the concept of compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD), a shift away from the requirement of a histological or radiological diagnosis of cirrhosis for initial patient risk stratification; (2) codification of methodology to use noninvasive assessments to identify clinically significant PH (CSPH); and (3) endorsement of a change in paradigm with the recommendation of early utilization of nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB) therapy when CSPH is identified in order to decrease the risk of cirrhosis decompensation'. The guidance also 'addresses new topics such as portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) as well as endoscopy prior to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)' and states that 'The present guidance does not focus on ascites as a complication of PH because this was recently covered in the AASLD Practice Guidance on ascites and related'.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic options for cirrhotic portal hypertension [^113NWR8v]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertension represents the primary non-neoplastic complication of liver cirrhosis and has life-threatening consequences, such as oesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension occurs due to increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome. Existing knowledge indicates that the profibrogenic phenotype acquired by sinusoidal cells is the initial factor leading to increased hepatic vascular tone and fibrosis, which cause increased vascular resistance and portal hypertension. Data also suggest that the phenotype of hepatic cells could be further impaired due to the altered mechanical properties of the cirrhotic liver itself, creating a deleterious cycle that worsens portal hypertension in the advanced stages of liver disease. In this Review, we discuss recent discoveries in the pathophysiology and treatment of cirrhotic portal hypertension, a condition with few pharmacological treatment options.

### Portal hypertension and its complications [^111HKAZA]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Portal hypertension is responsible for most of the complications associated with cirrhosis, specifically variceal hemorrhage, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and improvements in the diagnosis and management of its complications that have occurred over the last year are discussed.

Recent Findings

Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and may represent a novel therapeutic target. Hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements, when properly performed, are useful in the management of patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis has prognostic value and novel aquaretic and other agents may provide alternative approaches to the management of chronic liver disease. The mechanisms for bacterial translocation in cirrhosis that predisposes patients to infectious complications, such as spontaneous bacterial peritionitis, are being explored. Adrenal insufficiency is common in septic patients with advanced cirrhosis and corticosteroids may provide a survival benefit. Pulmonary disease complicates the management of patients with advanced liver disease.

Summary

Significant advances continue to be made in the diagnosis and management of the complications of portal hypertension in the face of an increasing burden of chronic liver disease.

Compensated cirrhosis with gastroesophageal varices (GEV) has, by definition, CSPH because "the lowest HVPG in these patients is 10–12 mm Hg", and in this setting "a reduction in HVPG to ≤ 12 mm Hg or ≥ 20% from baseline was shown to be protective of development of VH and constitutes an 'optimal response' to NSBBs". Monitoring surrogates is limited because "changes in heart rate do not correlate with changes in HVPG, and… NITs are not useful in assessing changes in HVPG", and "monitoring changes in HVPG should not be performed routinely". Clinical aims prioritize decompensation since "ascites, not variceal bleeding, is the most common decompensating event,… and patients with varices, compared to those without varices, are more likely to decompensate". Therapeutically, "local therapies, such as EVL… would only play a role in patients intolerant to pathophysiologically targeted therapies", and "reductions in HVPG > 10% induced by use of NSBBs in the prevention of first hemorrhage are associated not only with a lower incidence of first VH".

Proton pump inhibitors

A placebo-controlled randomised trial reported reduced bleeding and mortality with rabeprazole after eradication of varices. However, the study had a heterogeneous population with VBL performed for both primary and secondary prophylaxis and small numbers (n = 43), limiting the validity of the conclusions. Furthermore, there was no arm comparing proton pump inhibitors with NSBB. The use of proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis and ascites was associated with increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in a large retrospective study. This was not confirmed in a larger prospective non-randomised study. However, a recent prospective observational study has shown proton pump use to be associated with increased mortality in cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors are also associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection. There remains continuing concern about proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis, therefore caution should be used.

Endoscopic therapy

Variceal band ligation

VBL has been compared with NSBB in 19 trials in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis of 1504 patients. Despite reduced bleeding (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98) with VBL, there was no difference in overall mortality and bleeding-related mortality. The difference in bleeding was not seen when only trials with low selection or attrition bias were included. Banding can have serious complications. The risk of fatal banding-induced bleeding was highlighted in a meta-analysis showing reduced fatal adverse events with NSBB (OR = 0.14, 95% 0.02 to 0.99). The optimal timing of banding intervals is discussed in the section 'Secondary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage'. A randomised trial of 96 patients who underwent endoscopic surveillance at 6 or 3 months after eradication of varices with VBL did not demonstrate a difference in bleeding on mortality. However, the trial had a heterogeneous study group of patients who underwent VBL both for primary (65%) and secondary prevention (35%).

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114tvdjQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — perioperative risk in cirrhosis: Table 2 summarizes four recommendations. Given the association between clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and increased perioperative risk, in patients with compensated cirrhosis and unclear presence of CSPH, we suggest liver stiffness measurement and platelet count assessment to rule in CSPH using recommended thresholds, as well as cross-sectional imaging to identify portosystemic collaterals and/or complications of portal hypertension (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000 K/mm³) undergoing invasive procedures, we recommend thrombopoietin receptor agonists dosed according to baseline platelet count to reduce the need for perioperative transfusions and potentially reduce the risk of bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with alternative indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS; e.g., refractory ascites), we suggest preoperative TIPS to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality attributable to portal hypertension (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis undergoing major hepatic surgery, we suggest referral to a high-volume liver surgery and/or transplant center, when feasible (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Complications of cirrhosis [^111sNzDZ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic liver disease (CLD) causes significant morbidity and mortality, mainly due to complications [hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH)]. Studies of the complications, management and outcomes in patients with CLD over the past 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Percutaneous liver biopsy can be safely performed in patients with advanced liver disease with minimal complications. Predictors of response to lactulose, probiotics and L-ornithine-L-aspartate therapy in minimal hepatic encephalopathy have been reported. Rifaximin was found to lead to better maintenance of remission and decreased re-admission rates in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, and may improve driving performance in those with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. In a controversial study, patients with refractory ascites taking propranolol were found to have poorer outcomes, perhaps related to beta-blockade associated paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction. Terlipressin and albumin therapy currently appears to be the best medical therapy available in patients with type 1 HRS, although pentoxifylline may be effective to treat HRS in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients with gastric varices, primary prophylaxis with cyanoacrylate may decrease the probability of gastric variceal hemorrhage compared to nonselective beta-blockers. In patients with esophageal varices without bleeding, prophylaxis with variceal ligation or beta-blockers was similar in terms of bleeding, mortality, and adverse events. Erythromycin given 30 min prior to endoscopic evaluation in suspected EVH was associated with an overall benefit in visibility, duration of the procedure and length of hospital stay.

Summary

Refinement in clinical management strategies for patients with cirrhosis and its complications appears to continue to contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of SBP, primary prevention, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering primary prophylaxis for SBP in selected patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/L) ascites and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, BUN level > 25 mg/dL or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

In patients with suspected variceal bleeding, terlipressin (2 mg four times daily) should be administered intravenously as soon as possible to control bleeding. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that reduces portal pressure by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction and has been shown to improve control of bleeding, as well as reduce all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and with variceal bleeding. Significant adverse events with terlipressin are uncommon, but because of its vasoconstrictor activity it should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and those older than 65 years of age, making a baseline ECG mandatory. For patients who have a contraindication to terlipressin (or if terlipressin is unavailable), a continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide is an alternative. Once patients have been adequately resuscitated, endoscopy should be performed at the earliest opportunity (ideally within 6–12 h, but not more than 24 h) to determine the cause of bleeding and perform endotherapy as indicated. Bacterial infections, particularly SBP, are common in patients with cirrhosis in the first 7 days post-GI bleeding, occurring in 25%–65% of patients. Prophylaxis with antibiotics post-GI bleed have been shown to reduce short-term mortality, as well as the risk of rebleeding, septicaemia and SBP. It is, therefore, recommended that patients with cirrhosis and GI bleeding (variceal and non-variceal) receive prophylaxis with a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as cefotaxime or co-amoxiclav, as per hospital protocol, as soon as possible. Patients with advanced cirrhosis (any two of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy or jaundice) are at highest risk of developing infection and should receive the antibiotics intravenously. Importantly, there appears to be no increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for variceal bleeding compared with the hospital medical population.

PPI use in cirrhosis

Summary of the current evidence

PPI use in patients with liver cirrhosis must be very cautious since there is no evidence of benefit except for downgrading esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy or banding of esophageal varices. There is also some evidence that their use could be associated with development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

In clinical practice, PPI therapy is often used in cirrhotic patients, in the absence of acid-related disease, to prevent bleeding from hypertensive gastropathy. This approach is not evidence-based and therefore not justified, also taking into account that acid secretion is markedly reduced in these patients.

A systematic review, performed in 2008, was unable to find any randomized clinical trials on acid-lowering drugs in the prevention of esophago-gastric variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. It is therefore not possible to establish whether these drugs are beneficial or harmful in this setting. It is worth mentioning, however, that PPI use is associated with a microbiota shift and functional changes in the distal gut of patients with compensated cirrhosis, an effect that could drive or aggravate the pre-existing small intestine bacterial overgrowth.

The only indication of PPIs, which is by the way weakly evidence-based, is the prevention and/or treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy or variceal band ligation. The best available evidence supports the short-term use (maximum 10 days) of PPIs to reduce ulcer size, provided spontaneous ulcer healing is a concern. Practices such as high dose infusion and prolonged use should be discouraged until evidence of benefit becomes available.

When prescribing PPIs to cirrhotics, the benefit-to-harm ratio must be carefully evaluated. Indeed, PPI therapy seems to be a risk factor for the onset of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A meta-analysis showed that, compared to cirrhotic patients not receiving PPIs, those taking these drugs had an increased risk (N = 3815; OR = 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.09 − 4.74) of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, an effect more evident in case–control studies than in cohort studies. Another systematic review also found an increased overall risk of bacterial infections (OR = 1.98). A more recent case–control study discovered that PPI use in cirrhotic patients increases the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy in a dose-dependent fashion. All these analyses were mainly based on retrospective studies. The only large, multicenter, prospective trial with PPIs dealt with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and found acid suppression not associated with an increased risk. Further studies are therefore needed to better clarify these clinically relevant issues.

### An evidence-based approach to studies in cirrhosis and portal hypertension: medical management of mild to moderate ascites [^114y3LLY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Previous articles in this series have examined the critical appraisal of isolated structured clinical questions using the framework of evidence-based medicine. When patients are identified with a disease-specific process, however, an integrated approach for addressing multiple questions is required. This article, the sixth in the evidence-based medicine series for this journal, integrates critical appraisal techniques to examine the decision-making process used when evaluating a patient with cirrhosis and new-onset mild to moderate ascites. In the following clinical scenario, an approach is described for determining prognosis after the development of ascites and whether salt restriction and oral diuretics are effective therapies. The format is similar to other evidence-based medicine articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The evidence-based medicine concepts have been expanded from previous articles, and examples from the hepatology literature have been used.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites suffer from the continuous buildup of ascitic fluid in the abdomen. In some patients, the ascites may become refractory, resisting mobilization by diuretic therapy and sodium restriction. Refractory ascites is associated with poor clinical outcomes, diminished quality of life (QoL), and multiple complications, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute kidney injury (AKI) including hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), and hyponatremia. – The predicted survival rate of patients with refractory ascites may range from ~25% to 50% at 1 year, and expedited referral for liver transplantation is recommended. –

Standard of care (SOC) for patients with recurrent ascites consists of repeated removal of ascitic fluid through therapeutic paracentesis (TP) or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt in appropriate patients. However, TP does not address the underlying pathophysiology and can result in several serious complications. There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for refractory ascites.

Terlipressin is a long-acting synthetic analog of vasopressin that mediates vasoconstriction and antidiuretic activity. In patients with cirrhosis, terlipressin reduces splanchnic vasodilation associated with portal hypertension, resulting in an increase in effective arterial blood volume. Improved central circulatory volume increases renal perfusion and reduces salt and water retention, thereby decreasing ascites formation via modulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Terlipressin was recently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, indicated to improve kidney function in adults with HRS-AKI. The administration of terlipressin as intermittent, i.v. bolus injections has been associated with severe adverse events (AEs), including cardiovascular and respiratory complications associated with hypervolemia and redistribution of circulatory volume. – By contrast, continuous infusion of terlipressin can be a well-tolerated, effective treatment to reduce ascites accumulation and associated symptoms while improving muscle strength, plasma sodium regulation, and QoL.– Here, we report the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of continuous infusion terlipressin (BIV201) plus SOC versus SOC alone, administered on an outpatient basis, in adult patients with refractory ascites secondary to decompensated hepatic cirrhosis. The study was terminated early due to the demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BIV201, with data suggesting a need to modify the study criteria. The decision to terminate the study was made by the sponsor; it was neither based on a safety concern nor suggested by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

Secondary prophylaxis

In patients who survive an episode of SBP, the cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year is approximately 70%. Probability of survival at 1 year after an episode of SBP is 30–50% and falls to 25–30% at 2 years. There is only one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of norfloxacin (400 mg/day) in patients who had a previous episode of SBP; treatment reduced the probability of recurrence of SBP from 68% to 20%. A recent systematic review with meta-analysis concluded that rifaximin may be effective for both primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics and compared with no intervention. However, additional prospective studies are required before a change in clinical practice can be recommended. It has been suggested that proton pump inhibitor use may increase the risk for the development of SBP and indications for long-term use should be carefully assessed.

We therefore recommend norfloxacin 400 mg once a day as secondary prophylaxis, although in view of limited availability in the UK, many centres use once daily ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day as an alternative.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

Patients had compensated cirrhosis and PH. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established by clinical, biochemical, imaging, and/or histological criteria. Compensated cirrhosis was defined by absence of overt ascites or encephalopathy, history of variceal hemorrhage, and no jaundice. Patients were required to have HVPG > 5 mm Hg and PH based on any one of the following: (1) splenomegaly on imaging and/or clinical evaluation with platelet count of < 120,000, (2) small varices on screening endoscopy and/or collateral circulation on imaging, or (3) medium/large varices that had never bled and had been obliterated with endoscopic ligation.

Exclusion criteria were age < 18, decompensated cirrhosis defined by clinically overt ascites (requiring diuretics), overt encephalopathy (grade II or higher and requiring therapy), or history of variceal hemorrhage. Subjects with a history of overt ascites or grade II or higher encephalopathy who were currently stable (no ascites on physical examination and encephalopathy grade ≤ I, with or without specific medication) were eligible. Other exclusions included Child‐Pugh class C; other nonliver organ failure; total bilirubin > 12 mg/dL; international normalized ratio (INR) > 2.5; platelets < 20 × 10⁹/L; overt hepatic encephalopathy of grade III or higher; serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL; use of nonselective beta‐blockers (NSBBs), carvedilol, or nitrates; known human immunodeficiency virus infection; pancreatitis; portal vein thrombosis; plan to receive anti–hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the study; hepatitis B virus on stable therapy for less than 3 months; or hepatocellular carcinoma. An attempt was made to primarily enroll subjects with a history of NASH and/or HCV‐related cirrhosis and PH.

Concomitant use of fibrates, statins, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was allowed if there was no change in dose or regimen within 3 months of screening.

Male and female subjects of childbearing potential were required to use two reliable forms of contraception from screening to 1 month after the last dose of study drug.

The study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review committee of each participating hospital. All patients gave written informed consent.

5.3	Risk of Hepatic Decompensation/Failure in Patients with Evidence of Advanced Liver Disease

Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including ZEPATIER.

Reported cases occurred in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens with baseline cirrhosis with and without moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) as well as some patients without cirrhosis. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed in all patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease, such as portal hypertension, more frequent hepatic laboratory testing may be warranted; and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue ZEPATIER in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure.

ZEPATIER is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.9), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.4	Risks Associated with Ribavirin Combination Treatment

If ZEPATIER is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, including the pregnancy avoidance warning, also apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of warnings and precautions for ribavirin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.5	Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of ZEPATIER and certain drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to:

Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposure of concomitant drugs or components of ZEPATIER.
Significant decrease of elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER and possible development of resistance.

See Tables 2 and 6 for steps to prevent or manage these known or potentially significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

TABLE 3
Summary of AEs, laboratory parameters and laboratory parameter abnormalities in the clinical trial population

TABLE 4
Summary of adverse events, laboratory parameters and laboratory parameter abnormalities in the PMOS population

In the clinical trial cohort, a total of 3 patients experienced an AE of special interest consistent with hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure, 1 with platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L and 2 with platelet count ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L. One of these patients was a protocol violation due to the presence of moderate ascites present at study screening that was not recognized and who therefore had decompensated cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh > 6). This patient experienced worsening ascites on Day 8 without worsening of hepatic function, and therefore, continued G/P treatment without interruption and achieved SVR without additional worsening of symptoms. The patient had a baseline FibroScan score of 26.3 kPa, MELD score ≥ 10, Fibrosis‐4 score of 3.05, platelet count of 114 × 10⁹/L, and albumin of 2.7 g/dL. Of the other 2 patients with an AE of special interest that was consistent with hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure, 1 experienced a treatment‐emergent hepatic decompensation event of ascites and the other patient, an event of oesophageal variceal haemorrhage. One of these 2 patients was a 64‐year‐old white male with cirrhosis, a baseline Child‐Pugh score of 6, baseline thrombocytopenia (platelet count 114 × 10⁹/L), a medical history of portal hypertension, and known oesophageal varices, and who was a current alcohol drinker. The patient experienced a serious AE of oesophageal variceal haemorrhage on Day 22, and the Child‐Pugh score did not increase to > 6. The event was not considered related to the study drug, and the patient continued treatment and achieved SVR12 with his Child‐Pugh score improving to 5 after the event. The other patient who experienced ascites was a 55‐year‐old female who had baseline thrombocytopenia (66 × 10⁹/L), a history of CC with Child‐Pugh score 5, and portal hypertension. The patient experienced a non‐serious, Grade 1 event of ascites, with the onset on Day 86 (2 days post‐treatment). The event was not considered related to the study drug by the investigator and resolved on Day 124 (40 days post‐treatment).

5.2 Risk of Hepatic Decompensation/Failure in Patients with Evidence of Advanced Liver Disease

Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including MAVYRET. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The majority of patients with severe outcomes had evidence of advanced liver disease with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) prior to initiating therapy with MAVYRET, including some patients reported as having compensated cirrhosis with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A) at baseline but with a prior decompensation event (i.e., prior history of ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy). Rare cases of hepatic decompensation/failure were reported in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A); many of these patients had evidence of portal hypertension. Events also occurred in patients taking a concomitant medication not recommended for coadministration, or in patients with confounding factors such as serious liver-related medical or surgical comorbidities. Cases typically occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment (median of 27 days).

In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease such as portal hypertension, perform hepatic laboratory testing as clinically indicated; and monitor for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue MAVYRET in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure.

MAVYRET is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Purpose Of Review

Portal hypertension is the most common complication of cirrhosis accounting for significant morbidity and mortality mainly because of variceal hemorrhage, ascites, bacterial infections, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Advances in the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension over the last year are reviewed.

Recent Findings

The measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient provides important prognostic information in patients with portal hypertension. Noninvasive testing with transient elastography, capsule endoscopy, and computed tomography scanning for the diagnosis of esophageal varices is promising but more information is needed. Easily obtainable clinical data have been identified in patients with acute variceal bleeding that provides important information in determining initial response to therapy and prognosis. New therapies for patients with dilutional hyponatremia with vasopressin antagonists are promising and may improve the management of this condition. Terlipressin is the best medical therapy currently available for the management of hepatorenal syndrome as confirmed in recent studies. Patients with advanced liver disease benefit from the long-term administration of norfloxacin as it prevents the development of hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival.

Summary

The ongoing advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension will improve the high morbidity and mortality of the complications of cirrhosis

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided.
