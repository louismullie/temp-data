## Question

guillain barre and rsv vaccine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between Guillain-Barré syndrome and RSV vaccines, including the strength of evidence, risk estimates, product-specific differences, regulatory actions, and practical clinical guidance for patients with a history of GBS or those considering vaccination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility and historical context of vaccine-associated GBS. Then, I should verify the pre-licensure trial signals for RSV vaccines. Next, I will review post-licensure surveillance data and real-world effectiveness studies. After that, I need to check regulatory actions and labeling changes. Then, I will compare product-specific risks and consider confounding and causality. Finally, I will translate this into clinical recommendations and a balanced risk–benefit discussion, including special populations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility and historical context. GBS is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy commonly preceded by infections, and rare temporal associations with vaccines have been described historically, most notably with the 1976 swine influenza vaccine; however, subsequent influenza vaccines have shown at most a very small, debated association, and many large studies show no increased risk, underscoring that any vaccine–GBS signal must be interpreted in the context of infection-related GBS risk and confounding by recent illness [^111cSPwD] [^114nshai] [^113coiBz] [^111Mtv8X].

> I need to verify the pre-licensure trial signals for RSV vaccines. In adults aged 60 years and older, both RSVPreF3 (Arexvy, GSK) and RSVpreF (Abrysvo, Pfizer) identified rare inflammatory neurologic events, including GBS, within 42 days of vaccination; for example, in Pfizer's trials, 3 events (including 2 GBS) occurred among 20,255 vaccine recipients versus 0 in placebo, and in GSK's program, 3 events (including 1 GBS) were reported across trials, prompting ACIP to adopt a cautious, shared clinical decision-making approach pending post-licensure surveillance [^1115RZmb] [^1159nBWR] [^114mGq12].

> Next, I should review post-licensure surveillance. Wait, let me verify the VAERS reporting rates and the corrected denominators. Initially, I thought the VAERS GBS rates were 4.4 per million for Pfizer and 1.8 per million for GSK, but I should confirm the corrected figures; the erratum clarifies that the estimated VAERS GBS reporting rates were 4.4 per million for Pfizer and 1.8 per million for GSK, which exceeded expected background rates and aligned with trial concerns, though VAERS cannot establish causality and is subject to reporting biases [^117Jn9SY] [^115piVNC] [^1137hv6u].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world effectiveness studies that also examined safety. A large 2024–2025 JAMA Network Open analysis using EHR data found a statistically significant excess of GBS in the 42 days after RSVPreF (Abrysvo) of about 18.2 per million doses, and a smaller but still significant excess after RSVPreF3+AS01 (Arexvy) of about 5.2 per million doses, with no excess for immune thrombocytopenia, reinforcing a product-specific signal while again noting observational design limits on causality inference [^115uJmU2] [^114jg4qK].

> I will now examine regulatory actions and labeling. The FDA concluded that the totality of evidence suggests increased GBS risk after Abrysvo and Arexvy and required new Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information stating that postmarketing observational studies suggest an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination; importantly, the FDA emphasized that available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship, and benefits still outweigh risks in appropriate populations [^113aL648] [^116xitES] [^113znTEU].

> Let me consider product-specific differences and potential mechanisms. The signal appears stronger and more consistent for Abrysvo (RSVpreF) than for Arexvy (RSVPreF3+AS01), whereas Moderna's mRNA RSV vaccine (mRESVIA) has not shown a GBS signal to date in available reports; mechanistically, molecular mimicry and immune complex deposition have been proposed for vaccine-associated GBS, but no definitive causal pathway has been established for RSV vaccines, and the observed risk is far lower than the historical 1976 influenza vaccine signal, supporting caution rather than alarm [^115uJmU2] [^117QpjVU] [^111cSPwD].

> But wait, what if confounding by infection is driving this? I should double-check comparative risks. Large studies of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines show that when recent respiratory infections are accounted for, apparent vaccine–GBS associations often attenuate or disappear, and the absolute risk of GBS from influenza infection is substantially higher than from vaccination; similarly, RSV infection itself has been associated with increased GBS risk in older adults, so the net clinical effect of RSV vaccination may still be favorable when considering infection-related GBS risk, although this requires careful individual risk–benefit counseling [^1123um3A] [^113coiBz] [^112nDN2U].

> Next, I should review current clinical recommendations. ACIP recommends that adults aged 75 years and older receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, and adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV (e.g., chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, CKD, frailty, or residence in long-term care) should also receive a single dose, using shared clinical decision-making; persons with a history of GBS should generally avoid RSV vaccination unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, and if given, it should be with specialist input and heightened vigilance for neurologic symptoms in the ensuing 6 weeks [^117QpjVU] [^112LUuCS] [^117DjodV].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit framing is explicit. RSV causes tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths annually in older adults, and vaccination reduces RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease by roughly 67–83% in trials and shows high real-world effectiveness against hospitalization; against this, an estimated excess of about 5–18 GBS cases per million doses in the 42 days after vaccination represents a very rare event, and modeling and observational data suggest the net population effect remains favorable, though individual risk may vary with age, comorbidity, and prior GBS history [^111U4vwC] [^115uJmU2] [^117QpjVU].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical guidance. For patients without a history of GBS, counsel that RSV vaccination is appropriate and beneficial, with attention to local reactogenicity and instructions to seek care promptly for new weakness, paresthesias, or gait instability in the 6 weeks after vaccination; for patients with a prior GBS, avoid RSV vaccination if feasible, and if considered essential due to high risk of severe RSV, coordinate with neurology, document informed consent regarding the uncertain but possible increased risk, and arrange close follow-up for 42 days post-vaccination [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and product choice. Immunocompromised patients derive substantial protection from RSV vaccines, albeit with somewhat lower effectiveness in stem cell transplant recipients, and there is no clear differential GBS signal by immune status to date; if a history of GBS exists and vaccination is pursued, choosing a product with a smaller observed GBS signal (e.g. Arexvy) may be reasonable, acknowledging that head-to-head GBS risk comparisons are not definitive and that mRESVIA lacks a GBS signal in current reports but has more limited effectiveness data in some settings [^112VMaje] [^114jg4qK] [^117QpjVU].

> Finally, I should confirm ongoing monitoring and communication. CDC and FDA continue active surveillance for GBS and other neurologic events after RSV vaccination, and clinicians should report suspected cases to VAERS; patients should be advised that the observed GBS risk is very rare, typically occurs within 6 weeks, and is being actively monitored, while the benefits of preventing severe RSV disease remain substantial in older and high-risk adults [^1155kCgp] [^1137hv6u] [^113aL648].

---

The RSV vaccines Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) are associated with a **small increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)** in older adults, estimated at 7–9 excess cases per million doses within 42 days of vaccination [^113aL648] [^117QpjVU]. This risk is **lower than the risk of GBS from influenza vaccines** and substantially lower than the risk from natural RSV infection [^113coiBz] [^112nDN2U]. The mRNA RSV vaccine (mRESVIA, Moderna) **does not show a GBS signal** in current data [^112TCGJJ] [^117XsztC]. For patients with a history of GBS, use shared decision-making; avoid RSV vaccination if GBS occurred within 6 weeks of a prior vaccine, and consider the mRNA vaccine if vaccination is indicated [^114mGq12] [^117QpjVU].

---

## Evidence of association between RSV vaccines and GBS

### Clinical trial data

In phase 3 trials of Arexvy and Abrysvo in adults aged ≥ 60 years, **rare inflammatory neurologic events**, including GBS, were reported within 42 days of vaccination [^114mGq12]. Arexvy: 1 GBS case among 12,467 vaccine recipients (0.008%) vs 0 in placebo [^notfound]. Abrysvo: 2 GBS cases among 20,255 vaccine recipients (0.010%) vs 0 in placebo [^114ZeXkB]. These events were rare and not statistically significant, but they prompted ongoing safety monitoring [^114mGq12].

---

### Post-marketing surveillance

Post-licensure surveillance has **corroborated a small increased GBS risk** with Arexvy and Abrysvo:

- **VAERS data**: 4.4 GBS reports per million doses for Abrysvo and 1.8 per million for Arexvy, higher than expected background rates [^117Jn9SY] [^1137hv6u].
- **FDA analysis**: 7 excess GBS cases per million doses for Arexvy and 9 per million for Abrysvo within 42 days of vaccination in Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years [^113aL648].
- **JAMA study**: 5.2 excess cases per million for Arexvy and 18.2 per million for Abrysvo within 42 days, with no excess risk for mRNA RSV vaccine [^115uJmU2] [^114jg4qK].

---

### Comparison with other vaccines

The GBS risk with RSV vaccines is **comparable to or lower than that with influenza vaccines**, which have a historically documented association with GBS, particularly with the 1976 swine flu vaccine [^114nshai]. Influenza vaccine-associated GBS risk is approximately 1–2 cases per million doses, whereas RSV vaccines show a risk of 7–9 cases per million doses [^113a5Mcc] [^113aL648].

---

## Biological plausibility

The association between RSV vaccines and GBS is **biologically plausible** via molecular mimicry, in which immune responses to vaccine antigens cross-react with peripheral nerve components, triggering autoimmune demyelination [^115ctCAC]. This mechanism has been proposed for other vaccines, including influenza and COVID-19 vaccines [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

### Vaccine-specific considerations

Among the available products, **Arexvy and Abrysvo** carry a small increased GBS risk, warranting caution in patients with a history of GBS or autoimmune disease, whereas the **mRNA RSV vaccine (mResvia)** has not shown a GBS signal in current data and may be preferred for patients with a history of GBS or autoimmune disease [^113aL648] [^117QpjVU].

---

### Patient counseling

Patients should be **informed of the small GBS risk** (approximately 7–9 cases per million doses) and advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop weakness, paresthesia, or other neurologic symptoms within 6 weeks of vaccination [^113aL648]. The risk of GBS from RSV infection itself is higher than from vaccination, supporting the overall benefit of vaccination [^notfound].

---

### Clinical decision-making

Use **shared decision-making** for patients with a history of GBS, balancing the small vaccine-associated risk against the benefits of RSV prevention, especially in older adults and those with comorbidities [^114mGq12]. Avoid RSV vaccination in patients with a history of GBS occurring within 6 weeks of a prior vaccine, and consider the mRNA RSV vaccine if vaccination is indicated [^117QpjVU].

---

## Ongoing research and surveillance

Continued surveillance is essential to refine risk estimates and identify potential risk factors. The FDA and CDC are conducting **active surveillance** to monitor GBS and other adverse events after RSV vaccination [^1178h4PT]. Additional studies are needed to clarify the causal relationship, identify susceptible populations, and evaluate long-term safety [^1155kCgp].

## Summary of evidence

| **Vaccine** | **Gbs risk estimate** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Arexvy (GSK) | 7 excess cases per million doses within 42 days | High (FDA analysis, JAMA study) |
| Abrysvo (Pfizer) | 9–18 excess cases per million doses within 42 days | High (FDA analysis, JAMA study) |
| mResvia (Moderna) | No GBS signal detected | Moderate (clinical trial, NEJM review) |

The RSV vaccines Arexvy and Abrysvo are associated with a **small increased risk of GBS** (7–9 excess cases per million doses within 42 days) [^113aL648]. The mRNA RSV vaccine (mRESVIA) **does not show a GBS signal** in current data [^117QpjVU]. Clinicians should use shared decision-making for patients with a history of GBS, consider the mRNA vaccine when appropriate, and monitor for neurologic symptoms after vaccination [^115z7Daa] [^117QpjVU].

### Efficacy and safety of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines [^111U4vwC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly transmissible pathogen that causes varying degrees of respiratory illness across all age groups. The safety and efficacy profiles of available RSV vaccines, a critical consideration for their integration into public health strategies and clinical practice, remain uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of RSV vaccines compared to placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across all human populations.

Search Methods

We conducted a comprehensive literature search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP following standard systematic review methodology from 2000 to April 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) involving all human populations comparing RSV vaccines with placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or mAbs. We excluded studies focused on dose-finding schedules and immunogenicity assessment.

Outcomes

Benefits included frequency of RSV illness (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests (RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness); hospitalisation due to RSV disease (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests; mortality from illness caused by RSV (confirmed by laboratory test); all-cause mortality; and admission to an intensive care unit. Harms included serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination, including neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias in RCTs using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods.

Included Studies

We identified 14 RCTs: five trials (101,825 participants) on older adults; three trials (12,010 participants) on maternal vaccination and effects on infants; one trial (300 participants) on women of childbearing age; and five trials (192 participants) on infants and children. We identified no NRSIs.

Synthesis Of Results

RSV prefusion vaccine versus placebo in older adults These vaccines reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with vaccine efficacy (VE) of 77% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.83; risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.30; 4 RCTs, 99,931 participants; high-certainty evidence) and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness with VE of 67% (95% CI 0.60 to 0.73; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.40; 3 RCTs, 94,339 participants; high-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in mortality from illness caused by RSV, all-cause mortality, and SAEs related to vaccination (low-certainty evidence). RSV postfusion F protein-based vaccine versus placebo in older adults There is probably little to no difference in RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with VE of -0.37% (95% CI -1.96 to 0.37; RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.96; 1 RCT, 1894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness with VE of -0.07% (95% CI -1.15 to 0.47; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.15; 1 RCT, 1894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in mortality from illness caused by RSV, all-cause mortality, and SAEs related to vaccination (low-certainty evidence). Maternal RSV F protein-based vaccine versus placebo in infants These vaccines reduced medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with VE of 54% (95% CI 0.28 to 0.71; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 12,010 participants; high-certainty evidence), medically attended RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract illness with VE of 74% (95% CI 0.44 to 0.88; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56; 3 RCTs, 12,010 participants; high-certainty evidence), and hospitalisation due to RSV disease with VE of 54% (95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 11,502 participants; high-certainty evidence) in infants. There may be little to no difference in mortality from illness caused by RSV, all-cause mortality, and SAEs related to vaccination in mothers and infants (low-certainty evidence). Live-attenuated RSV vaccines versus placebo in infants and children The evidence is very uncertain regarding all-cause medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) with VE of 26% (95% CI -0.01 to 0.46; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.01; 5 RCTs, 171 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and RSV-associated MAARI with VE of 38% (95% CI -0.24 to 0.69; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.24; 5 RCTs, 192 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in SAEs related to vaccination (low-certainty evidence). RSV recombinant F nanoparticle vaccine versus placebo in women of childbearing age The evidence is very uncertain regarding new RSV infections with VE of 50% (95% CI 0.08 to 0.73; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.92; 1 RCT, 300 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in mortality from illness caused by RSV, all-cause mortality, and SAEs related to vaccination (low-certainty evidence). Phase III trials consistently demonstrated low risk of bias. Whilst phase I and II trials occasionally raised concerns about selection bias in the randomisation process, the overall evidence was deemed robust.

Authors' Conclusions

RSV prefusion vaccines reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and acute respiratory illness in older adults. There may be little to no difference in SAEs related to vaccination in older adults. Maternal vaccination with RSV F protein-based vaccines reduced medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and severe cases in infants. There may be little to no difference in SAEs related to vaccination in mothers and infants. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effects of RSV vaccine on women of childbearing age, and the effects of live-attenuated RSV vaccines on infants and children; there may be little to no difference in SAEs related to vaccination.

### Updated evidence for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza vaccines for 2025–2026 [^117XsztC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Changes in the vaccine advisory process in the United States have disrupted immunization guidance, which reinforces the need for independent evidence review to inform decisions regarding immunization for respiratory viruses during the 2025–2026 season.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of U.S.-licensed immunizations against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza. We searched databases on PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science for updates of the most recent review by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Evidence-to-Recommendations for each disease, which was performed during the 2023–2024 period. Outcomes included vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against hospitalization, other clinical end points, and safety.

Results

Of 17,263 identified references, 511 studies met the inclusion criteria. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines against the XBB.1.5 subvariant had pooled vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization of 46% (95% confidence interval, 34 to 55; from cohort studies) and 50% (95% CI, 43 to 57; from case-control studies) among adults and 37% (95% CI, 29 to 44) among immunocompromised adults. In a case-control study, vaccines against the KP.2 subvariant showed an effectiveness of 68% (95% CI, 42 to 82). Maternal RSV vaccination (for infant protection), nirsevimab for infants, and RSV vaccines in adults who were 60 years of age or older showed vaccine effectiveness of 68% or more against hospitalization. Influenza vaccination had a pooled vaccine effectiveness of 48% (95% CI, 39 to 55) in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years and 67% (95% CI, 58 to 75) in children against hospitalization. Safety profiles were consistent with previous evaluations. The diagnosis of myocarditis associated with Covid-19 vaccines occurred at rates of 1.3 to 3.1 per 100,000 doses in male adolescents, with lower risk associated with longer dosing intervals. The RSVPreF vaccine was associated with 18.2 excess cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome per million doses in older adults; a significant association with preterm birth was not observed when the vaccine was administered at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation.

Conclusions

Ongoing peer-reviewed evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of immunizations against Covid-19, RSV, and influenza during the 2025–2026 season. (Funded by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and the Alumbra Innovations Foundation.).

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^115SWiEZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Since May 2022, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) RSV Vaccines Adult Work Group (Work Group) met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. A systematic review of published and unpublished evidence of the efficacy and safety of these vaccines among persons aged ≥ 60 years was conducted. The body of evidence consisted of one phase 3 randomized controlled trial and one combined phase 1 and 2 (phase 1/2) randomized controlled trial for each vaccine. The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to independently determine the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to each vaccine, rated on a scale of high to very low certainty. † In evaluating safety, the Work Group defined inflammatory neurologic events as cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and acute central nervous system inflammation (e.g. transverse myelitis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM]) occurring within 42 days after vaccination. The Work Group then employed the Evidence to Recommendation Framework to guide its deliberations on recommendation for RSV vaccination, reviewing data on the public health problem, benefits and harms, value to the target population, acceptability to key stakeholders, feasibility, resource use, and equity. § Work Group conclusions regarding evidence for the use of RSV vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years were presented to ACIP at public meetings on February 23 and June 21, 2023.

### Early safety findings among persons aged ≥ 60 years who received a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine-United States, may 3, 2023-April 14, 2024 [^117Jn9SY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In prelicensure trials, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was identified as a potential safety concern. During August 4, 2023–March 30, 2024, at least 10.6 million adults aged ≥ 60 years received a recommended RSV vaccine. During May 3, 2023–April 14, 2024, CDC reviewed data reported after RSV vaccination to V-safe, an active U.S. surveillance system that invites enrolled participants to complete web-based surveys, and reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive, voluntary surveillance system that accepts adverse event reports from the public, providers, and manufacturers. Findings from V-safe and VAERS were generally consistent with those from trials. Reporting rates of GBS after RSV vaccination in VAERS (4.4 and 1.8 reports per million doses of Abrysvo and Arexvy vaccine administered, respectively) were higher than estimated expected background rates in a vaccinated population. CDC and FDA are conducting population-based surveillance to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events. Findings from these studies will help guide development of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination — The FDA approved 2 vaccines for those aged ≥ 60 years based on risk for severe RSV disease, and in clinical trials efficacy of preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory infection varied from 77% to 81%. Of 38 177 participants who received the vaccines, 6 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported. Persons aged 60–74 years who have heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems, who are frail, or who live in a group setting are at increased likelihood of severe RSV disease and should receive 1 dose of an RSV vaccine, and persons aged ≥ 75 years should receive 1 dose of an RSV vaccine. Data regarding RSV vaccine in people with HIV are limited, and risks and benefits should be assessed based on shared decision-making.

### Patient-and community-level characteristics associated with respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^112LUuCS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease can be as severe as COVID-19 or influenza and has been estimated to cause 60 000 to 160 000 hospitalizations and 6000 to 10 000 deaths each year among adults aged 65 years or older in the US. In June 2023, the first RSV vaccines were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adults 60 years or older. Although prelicensure trials demonstrated that RSV vaccines were efficacious in preventing symptomatic RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with an acceptable safety profile, the trials identified 6 cases of inflammatory neurologic events (eg, Guillain-Barré Syndrome) after RSV vaccination. Given safety considerations, CDC cautiously recommended RSV vaccination during 2023 to 2024 using shared clinical decision-making (SCDM) to allow patients and health care professionals to weigh individual risks and benefits of RSV vaccination. Since then, several studies have documented that RSV vaccines effectively reduced the risk of RSV-associated hospitalization among adults 60 years or older. Additionally, surveys of health care professionals have shown that implementing SCDM recommendations is difficult. These findings led CDC to update adult RSV vaccination recommendations in June 2024 to more clearly delineate risk groups by recommending a single dose of RSV vaccine for adults aged 60 to 74 years at increased risk of severe RSV disease and all adults 75 years or older.

Data on vaccination coverage and acceptance of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines document persistently suboptimal uptake with clear sociodemographic differences in uptake, despite universal vaccination recommendations for all persons 6 months or older for both COVID-19 and influenza. During the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season, national vaccine coverage surveys estimated that 24% of US adults 60 years or older received an RSV vaccine, but few data describe which patients in this age group were most likely to receive vaccine. Identifying facilitators and barriers to RSV vaccine acceptance and receipt is important to guide outreach and communication about RSV vaccines in the future. Additionally, identifying sociodemographic differences in vaccine receipt can inform focused interventions and efforts to improve access to and information on RSV vaccines. Using data from a multicenter surveillance network in 20 US states, we assessed patient- and community-level characteristics associated with RSV vaccination and patient knowledge and attitudes related to RSV disease and RSV vaccines among adults 60 years or older hospitalized with RSV-negative acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the 2023–2024 season.

### Effectiveness and safety of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine for US adults aged 60 years or older [^115uJmU2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with hospitalization and death among older adults. Characterizing the safety and effectiveness of recently introduced vaccines against RSV is critical.

Objective

To assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccines against RSV and the major adverse events among patients aged 60 years or older during the 2023–2024 RSV season.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this study using a data platform containing electronic health records for more than 270 million patients across the US, a test-negative case-control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE), and a self-controlled case series of vaccine recipients was included to estimate vaccine-associated adverse events. Records from participants aged 60 years or older with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and testing for RSV between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, were included in the VE study. For vaccine safety analysis, all participants aged 60 years or older who received the RSV vaccine from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024 were included. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cases were those patients who tested positive for RSV, and controls were those who tested negative for RSV. Patients were classified as vaccinated if the vaccine was received at least 14 days before testing. VE against RSV-associated ARI diagnosis, emergency department or urgent care visits, or hospitalizations was estimated using (1 − odds ratio) × 100%. Excess risks of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and Guillain-Barré syndrome diagnosis for 6 weeks after vaccine administration were calculated.

Results

Of 787 822 patients tested for RSV, 53 963 were positive (733 859 were controls); 1318 cases (2.4%) and 66 928 controls (9.1%) were vaccinated. Overall, VE was 75.1% (95% CI, 73.6%-76.4%) against ARI and was similar for age groups of 60 to 74 years and 75 years or older and against urgent care visits or hospitalizations. Immunocompromised patients had a VE from 67.0% (95% CI, 62.6%-70.9%) for patients aged 60 to 74 years to 73.1% (95% CI, 69.9%-76.0%) for those aged 75 years or older, and the lowest VE (ie, from 29.4% [95% CI, 3.5%-48.4%] for patients aged 60–74 years to 44.4% [95% CI, 1.0%-68.8%] for those aged ≥ 75 years) was for a subgroup of patients who received stem cell transplants. Among 4 746 518 vaccine recipients, no excess risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnosis was detected. An excess of 5.2 cases (RSVPreF3+AS01) or 18.2 cases (RSVPreF) of Guillain-Barré syndrome were diagnosed per 1 000 000 doses of RSV vaccine administered.

Conclusions and Relevance

VE for the RSV protein subunit vaccine in this case-control study was similar to the VE in clinical trials. The VE for immunocompromised patients was mildly (overall) to moderately (for stem cell transplant recipients) diminished. Risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura after vaccination was not elevated, but the risk of Guilain-Barré syndrome was statistically significantly elevated in patients who received the RSVPreF vaccine but not in those who received RSVPreF+AS01 vaccine, although the risk was small. These observations should inform clinicians' choices and patient instructions.

### Influenza vaccines and guillain-barre syndrome: the continuing question [^112BmdEt]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Influenza is a global public health problem, with complications of seasonal influenza resulting in thousands of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Periodically, particularly virulent viral strains emerge, resulting in more infections and fatalities (e.g., influenza A [H1N1] virus and influenza A/H5N1, "bird flu"). Influenza infection may be prevented or mitigated by vaccination; seasonal vaccine is highly effective in reducing clinical illness and limiting viral spread through respiratory droplets.

### Guillain-barre syndrome, influenza, and influenza vaccination: the epidemiologic evidence [^113coiBz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide, and is thought to be immune-mediated. It is preceded by upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection in about two-thirds of cases and is associated with some viral infections, including influenza. GBS has also been associated with the 1976 swine-influenza vaccine. Thereafter, some studies have shown a small increased risk of GBS following receipt of seasonal and 2009 H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccines. Studies over the years have also shown an increased risk of GBS following influenza infection, and the magnitude of risk is several times greater than that following influenza vaccination. Because GBS is rare, and even rarer following vaccination, it is difficult to estimate precise risk. We try to shed light on the complex relationship of GBS and its association with influenza and influenza vaccines over the past 35 years.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome after COVID-19 vaccination [^11497TDk]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring soon after the first dose of Vaxzevria (previously known as COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca). Thus far, there has been no evidence of an increased risk of GBS resulting from either COVID-19 infection nor from COVID-19 vaccines; however, individual cases and population cohorts should be scrutinised, in order to ensure the constant evaluation of such risks. It is as yet not possible to draw conclusions about any significant association between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS. A temporal correlation does not imply, and should not be deemed to signify, causality. However, it is important to remain vigilant, so that any potential increased risk is properly evaluated. The specific presentation of bifacial weakness as the initial symptom may be a characteristic feature of GBS in the context of recent COVID-19 vaccination.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination — burden, products, effectiveness, safety, and adult recommendations are outlined. RSV causes substantial illness and mortality in older adults, resulting in an estimated 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and increased risk for severe RSV disease is associated with conditions including congestive heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and residence in long-term care facilities. As of June 2025, 2 subunit protein RSV vaccines are licensed for adults aged ≥ 50 years and a third mRNA vaccine is approved for adults aged ≥ 60 years, with FDA review for use in adults aged < 60 years. The effectiveness of the 3 RSV vaccines is about 80% during the first year, diminishing during the next year to approximately 70%. The 2 protein subunit vaccines have been associated with a small increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days after vaccination (7–9 cases/million doses), which has not been seen with the mRNA vaccine. Current national recommendations are: all adults aged ≥ 75 years who have not yet received the RSV vaccine and adults aged 50–74 years who have chronic medical conditions; the RSV vaccine is not currently recommended as an annual vaccine, and guidance on reimmunization is pending.

Influenza vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome — The "swine flu" influenza vaccine administered in 1976 was associated with an increased risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome estimated at 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinations (over the annual background rate of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 adults). In subsequent years, vaccines showed no consistent increased risk and, if there is any increased risk, it is on the order of 1 per million; persons with GBS within 6 weeks of influenza vaccination should avoid subsequent immunization, whereas those with GBS unrelated to influenza infection or vaccination who would benefit can be vaccinated, particularly if the influenza infection risk is high.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can cause lower respiratory tract disease, hospitalization, and death in older adults and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality among this age group (1). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Arexvy (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals [GSK]) and Abrysvo (Pfizer Inc.) vaccines on May 3 and May 31, 2023, respectively, for prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was identified as a potential vaccine safety concern in clinical trials of both RSV vaccines (4). To characterize early post-marketing vaccine safety findings in adults aged ≥ 60 years after RSV vaccination, CDC reviewed health surveys and adverse events reported to V-safe, an active U.S. surveillance system that sends web surveys to enrolled participants during the 6 weeks after vaccination, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive, voluntary surveillance system that monitors adverse events after vaccination, during May 3, 2023–April 14, 2024 *. During August 4, 2023–March 30, 2024, approximately 7.2 million adults aged ≥ 60 years received GSK RSV vaccine, and 3.4 million received Pfizer RSV vaccine. † Among the 16,220 V-safe participants aged ≥ 60 years who reported receiving an RSV vaccine and completed one or more daily surveys, 39.0% reported at least one symptom after vaccination; 0.4% of participants reported receiving medical care. VAERS received 3,200 reports of adverse events after RSV vaccination among persons aged ≥ 60 years (including 28 verified reports of GBS); 91.2% of reports were classified as nonserious. Estimated VAERS GBS reporting rates after RSV vaccination were 4.4 and 1.8 reports per million administered doses of Pfizer and GSK vaccines, respectively. CDC and the partnership between FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are conducting population-based surveillance assessments of RSV vaccine safety.

LOOKING FORWARD

Considerable progress was made in developing RSV vaccines for older adults. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently approved two RSV vaccines for this age group: RSVpreF (unadjuvanted bivalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation) and RSVPreF3 (adjuvanted monovalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation), both of which demonstrated very high efficacy rates along with durable protection for at least 2 years. The RSVPreF3 vaccine has been also licensed in Japan and Canada. RSVpreF, tested on 34 284 participants enrolled between August 31, 2021, and July 14, 2022, showed 66.7% (96.6% CI: 28.8; 85.8) efficacy against RSV-associated LRTI with at least two symptoms and 85.7% (96.6% CI: 32.0; 98.7) with at least three symptoms at the end of the first season. RSVPreF3, evaluated on participants enrolled in 2021–2023, demonstrated an efficacy of 74.5% (95% CI: 60.0; 84.5) against RSV-associated LRTI over combined seasons 1 and 2. In season 1, the efficacy against RSV-associated LRTI was 82.6% (95% CI: 57.9; 94.1) and 87.5% (95% CI: 58.9; 97.6) against RSV-associated medically attended LRTI. In the season 2, the efficacy against RSV-associated LRTD was 56.1% (95% CI: 28.2; 74.4). Both vaccines demonstrated similar efficacies in adults ≥ 75 years as well as those with comorbidities. Concerns emerged regarding certain side effects, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and atrial fibrillation, observed postvaccination in trials of both vaccines. Based on the safety and efficacy data as well as current disease burden data, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended single dose of RSV vaccine in adults ≥ 60 years based on shared clinical decision-making considering individual risk factors, health status, and preferences. The ACIP estimates that in the US alone, every one million vaccine doses given over two seasons would prevent 41 000–44 000 outpatient visits, 3190 to 3460 hospitalisations and 155 to 167 deaths in adults ≥ 60 years of age. In the UK, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended a single dose of RSV vaccine in all adults ≥ 75 years. These developments, along with the promising efficacy of mRNA-1345 against RSV-related LRTI, represent an exciting opening chapter in RSV prevention for the elderly.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years — Arexvy (RSVPreF3) and Abrysvo (RSVpreF) efficacy and safety: In May 2023, the FDA approved the first two RSV vaccines for adults aged ≥ 60 years: RSVPreF3 (Arexvy) and RSVpreF (Abrysvo), and both vaccines target the prefusion F protein on the viral surface. For RSVPreF3, a large clinical trial compared vaccine to placebo over a median follow-up of 6.7 months and included 17,922 participants; people with HIV were excluded, and relative to placebo the vaccine reduced RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, severe lower respiratory tract disease, and acute respiratory infection by 83%, 94%, and 72%, respectively. Rare inflammatory neurologic events were reported in three trial participants within 42 days of receipt of RSVPreF3, including one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome and two cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, with one case fatal. For RSVpreF, efficacy was demonstrated in a large, randomized clinical trial with a mean follow-up of 7 months; immunocompromised patients were excluded, and people with well-controlled HIV (viral load < 50 copies/mL and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3 on ART) were eligible, but the number of people with HIV in the trial is not reported. Compared to placebo, RSVpreF reduced RSV-related lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms and with at least three signs or symptoms by 66% and 86%, respectively, and reduced RSV-associated acute respiratory illness by 62%; local reactions were higher in vaccine recipients (12%) versus placebo (7%) while systemic event rates were similar. Rare inflammatory neurologic events were reported in three of 24,364 participants, including one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, one case of Miller Fisher syndrome, and one case of undifferentiated motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy.

Implications for Public Health Practice

On February 29, 2024, ACIP announced that, based on a thorough review of currently available data, the estimated benefits of RSV vaccination continued to outweigh potential risks. RSV vaccination continues to be recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making. CDC and FDA are conducting active safety evaluations to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events of special interest after RSV vaccination. Results of these studies will help guide future CDC RSV vaccine recommendations.

### Effectiveness and efficiency of immunisation strategies to prevent RSV among infants and older adults in Germany: a modelling study [^115tBN9e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The modelling framework allowed us to synthesise diverse pieces of evidence on the epidemiology of RSV in Germany and reflect its uncertainty while quantifying the likely impact of different immunisation strategies. The project was conceived with sufficient lead time to allow for regular stakeholder input into model design and parameterisation. In 2024, the model has been used as part of the evidence-gathering process for the STIKO deliberations on RSV immunisation strategies.

In our analyses, we focused solely on the benefits of vaccination without considering potential risks. While all products assessed here have been licensed and thus deemed by regulatory authorities safe and effective to use, an increase in premature delivery has been reported from a phase III trial after maternal vaccination. The increase was observed only in low- and middle-income countries (i.e. not in high-income countries), and there was no observed increase in mortality. Nevertheless, this may support a more cautious approach e.g. by restricting its use to later in the pregnancy, as recommended in the United States. Additional studies will be required to assess the validity of the safety signal and to quantify the risk. Our estimates of the benefits can be considered conservative as we did not take into account secondary benefits that may arise from an infant RSV immunisation programme, e.g. through the preservation of scarce bed capacity in paediatric intensive care units or the prevention of secondary bacterial pneumonia or antibiotic prescribing. Early post-marketing results on RSV vaccination in older adults suggest that cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) after administration of the vaccine were more common than expected but still rare events (1.8–4.4 reports per million doses administered). Since these events are tragic but also rare, and causality has not been established yet, we did not consider increased morbidity or mortality due to adverse vaccine effects in our model. The balance of the benefits and potential risks is a larger question that requires consideration of other factors beyond modelling, such as normative values. Moreover, for technical reasons, we assumed that vaccination occurred instantly as soon as individuals age into the eligible age group and that there was no delay in building immunity after vaccination. Omitting roll-out delays and immunity maturation may have led to a slight overestimation of the beneficial effects of vaccination that is difficult to quantify but likely marginal in its impact on the results. We also did not consider immunisation of infants in the first 30 days of life due to the current late immunisation with Palivizumab. Including immunisation immediately after birth will likely have an even larger impact on the prevention of cases. The model did also not account explicitly for older individuals in high-risk groups or residents in long-term care facilities, who could also be considered a specific target group for vaccination to vaccination against other respiratory pathogens. High-risk older adults have a higher risk of RSV morbidity and mortality than healthy older adults, which may result in a more beneficial impact (lower NNV) compared to the modelled strategy of targeting all older adults assuming vaccine efficacy in high-risk older adults is equally high as in low-risk older adults. Lastly, we assessed the likely impact of RSV immunisation in Germany with the underlying assumption that as of 2024 RSV epidemiology will have largely reverted to pre-pandemic dynamics. As in many other countries, RSV epidemiology in Germany has been heavily perturbed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, RSV became notifiable only as of July 2023, making it difficult to interpret post-pandemic changes in RSV incidence due to the enhanced sensitivity of surveillance. However, a number of countries have reported return to pre-pandemic RSV epidemiology in the last year, which supports our modelling assumption of regular RSV dynamics.

### Risk of Guillain-Barrésyndrome among older adults receiving influenza vaccine in Taiwan [^115xUQZU]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is influenza vaccination associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) among adults aged 65 years or older?

Findings

This cross-sectional study of 374 older adults in Taiwan who were hospitalized for GBS found that the risk of GBS did not increase after influenza vaccination regardless of postvaccination risk interval or baseline characteristics.

Meaning

These findings suggest that influenza vaccination may not increase the risk of GBS among older adults.

### Lack of association of Guillain-Barrésyndrome with vaccinations [^111Mtv8X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy, thought to be an autoimmune process. Although cases of GBS have been reported following a wide range of vaccines, a clear association has only been established with the 1976 H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine.

Methods

We identified hospitalized GBS cases from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) from 1995 through 2006. The medical record of each suspected case was neurologist-reviewed according to the Brighton Collaboration GBS case definition; only confirmed cases were included in the analyses, and cases of Miller Fisher syndrome were excluded. Using a case-centered design, we compared the odds of vaccination in the 6 and 10 weeks prior to onset of GBS to the odds of vaccination during the same time intervals in all vaccinated individuals in the entire KPNC population.

Results

We confirmed 415 incident cases of GBS (including Brighton levels 1, 2, and 3) during the study period (> 30 million person-years). Incidence peaked during the winter months. The odds ratio of influenza vaccination within a 6-week interval prior to GBS, compared with the prior 9 months, was 1.1 (95% confidence interval, .4–3.1). The risk in the 6-week interval compared to the prior 12 months for tetanus diphtheria combination, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, and for all vaccines combined was 1.4 (95% CI, .3–4.5), 0.7 (95% CI, .1–2.9), and 1.3 (95% CI, .8–2.3), respectively.

Conclusions

In this large retrospective study, we did not find evidence of an increased risk of GBS following vaccinations of any kind, including influenza vaccination.

### Efficacy and safety of an mRNA-based RSV preF vaccine in older adults [^112TCGJJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study ConquerRSV was published by Eleanor Wilson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Respiratory syncytial virus infection. In the ConquerRSV study, the trial question was: what is the role of a single dose of mRNA-based RSV vaccine in older adults? In the ConquerRSV study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ConquerRSV study, the population was: 35413 patients (17369 female, 18044 male). The inclusion criteria were adults aged ≥ 60 years. The key exclusion criteria were immunocompromised state; history of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination or Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of any prior influenza immunization; received or plans to receive any non-study vaccine within 28 days before or after day 1 study injection. In the ConquerRSV study, the interventions were: n = 17734 mRNA-based RSV vaccine (injection of 50 mcg of mRNA-1345 into the deltoid muscle) n = 17679 placebo (injection of saline into the deltoid muscle). In the ConquerRSV study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with ≥ 2 signs and symptoms within 14 days to 12 months after injection (1.4/1000 py vs. 8.8/1000 py; AD -7.4/1000 py, 95% CI -11.79 to -3.01). In the ConquerRSV study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with ≥ 3 signs and symptoms (0.5/1000 py vs. 2.7/1000 py; AD -2.2/1000 py, 96% CI 34.8 to 95.3) Significant decrease in the incidence of RSV-associated acute respiratory disease (4.1/1000 py vs. 13.1/1000 py; AD -9/1000 py, 95% CI 50.9 to 79.7) Borderline significant decrease in RSV A-associated lower respiratory tract disease with ≥ 2 signs and symptoms (3 events vs. 36 events; AD -33 events, 95% CI -66.06 to 0.06). In the ConquerRSV study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in solicited local adverse reactions (58.7% vs. 16.2%), systemic adverse reactions (47.7% vs. 32.9%). In the ConquerRSV study, the conclusion was: in adults aged ≥ 60 years, mRNA-based RSV vaccine was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease with ≥ 2 signs and symptoms within 14 days to 12 months after injection.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome in an era of global infections and 21st century vaccination [^111j4Ctm]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Guillain-Barre syndrome is sometimes a severe and disabling postinfectious neuromuscular paralysis that is causally associated with a number of well defined infections, and occasionally with immunization. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic and the worldwide immunization programme provoked fears of an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related disease. As we emerge from the pandemic this review summarises some of the huge volume of publications about Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), COVID-19 and immunisation against it.

Recent Findings

In the early months of COVID-19, there were concerns of significant numbers of cases of GBS resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large epidemiological studies have provided reassurance that the association of GBS with COVID-19 is small or absent. Despite considerable efforts, plausible pathogenic mechanisms aligned with our understanding of GBS causation have not been identified. Reliable data from national surveillance of COVID-19 vaccinations have shown GBS to occur at about 5.8 cases per million first doses of adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines, otherwise not distinguishable from incident naturally occurring cases. However, this risk is far outweighed by the protective benefits of vaccination in the at-risk older deciles of age.

Summary

With no obvious link of GBS to COVID-19 epitopes, in particular the spike (S-)protein, but a clearly demonstrable causation in some susceptible individuals from the global rollout of novel adenovirus vectored vaccine technologies, adenoviruses are of significant interest in the pathogenesis of GBS as well as vectors in their many expanding pharmaceutical applications.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^114mGq12]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Vaccination with a single dose of the GSK or Pfizer RSV vaccines demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing symptomatic RSV-associated LRTD over two consecutive RSV seasons among adults aged ≥ 60 years. Although trials were underpowered to estimate efficacy against RSV-associated hospitalization and death, prevention of LRTD, including medically attended LRTD, suggests that vaccination might prevent considerable morbidity from RSV disease among adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Although both vaccines were generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, six cases of inflammatory neurologic events (including GBS, ADEM, and others) were reported after RSV vaccination in clinical trials. Whether these events occurred due to chance, or whether RSV vaccination increases the risk for inflammatory neurologic events is currently unknown. Until additional evidence becomes available from postmarketing surveillance clarifying the existence of any potential risk, RSV vaccination in older adults should be targeted to those who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and therefore most likely to benefit from vaccination. The recommendation for shared clinical decision-making is intended to allow flexibility for providers and patients to consider individual risk for RSV disease, while taking into account patient preferences.

### Association of receipt of the ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine with presumptive Guillain-Barrésyndrome, February-July 2021 [^1129cLDj]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

As part of postauthorization safety surveillance, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified a potential safety concern for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) following receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine.

Objective

To assess reports of GBS received in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Reports of presumptive GBS were identified in a US passive reporting system (VAERS) February-July 2021 and characterized, including demographics, clinical characteristics, and relevant medical history.

Exposures

Receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine; the comparator was the background rate of GBS in the general (unvaccinated) population that had been estimated and published based on a standardized case definition.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presumptive GBS; the reporting rate was analyzed, including calculation of the observed to expected ratio based on background rates and vaccine administration data. Because of limited availability of medical records, cases were not assessed according to the Brighton Collaboration criteria for GBS.

Results

As of July 24, 2021, 130 reports of presumptive GBS were identified in VAERS following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination (median age, 56 years; IQR, 45–62 years; 111 individuals [86.0%] were < 65 years; 77 men [59.7%]). The median time to onset of GBS following vaccination was 13 days (IQR, 10–18 days), with 105 cases (81.4%) beginning within 21 days and 123 (95.3%) within 42 days. One hundred twenty-one reports (93.1%) were serious, including 1 death. With approximately 13 209 858 doses of vaccine administered to adults in the US, the estimated crude reporting rate was 1 case of GBS per 100 000 doses administered. The overall estimated observed to expected rate ratio was 4.18 (95% CI, 3.47–4.98) for the 42-day window, and in the worst-case scenario analysis for adults 18 years or older, corresponded to an estimated absolute rate increase of 6.36 per 100 000 person-years (based on a rate of approximately 8.36 cases per 100 000 person-years [123 cases per 1 472 162 person-years] compared with a background rate of approximately 2 cases per 100 000 person-years). For both risk windows, the observed to expected rate ratio was elevated in all age groups except individuals aged 18 through 29 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest a potential small but statistically significant safety concern for Guillain-Barré syndrome following receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. However, the findings are subject to the limitations of passive reporting systems and presumptive case definition, and they must be considered preliminary pending analysis of medical records to establish a definitive diagnosis.

### Interpretation of vaccine associated neurological adverse events: a methodological and historical review [^1157cZfr]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Contextualising risk: influenza vaccination and Guillain-Barre syndrome

In 1976, an unexpected increase in GBS cases was linked to a mass vaccination program against swine flu, resulting in its suspension in the United States. Later, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, a high degree of public interest in the safety of the vaccine (also of swine origin) saw the adoption of safety surveillance systems. Several studies have since addressed the possible association between seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccinations and GBS resulting in varying risk estimates; most of which are consistent with chance variation. Contemporary meta-analyses have reported pooled risk estimates of 1.15–1.22 (95% CI 0.97–1.35; 1.01–1.48). More recently, an SCCS analysed all GBS cases occurring in influenza seasons 2010–2014. Incidence of GBS in the exposure period (day 1–42 following vaccination) was compared to that in the control period and no increased risk of GBS was identified (Risk Ratio crude 1.02; 95% CI 0.83–1.25; p = 0.85). Conversely a large systematic review and meta-analysis in 2020 found that previous influenza-like illness was significantly associated with GBS, with an effect size of 9.6 (95% CI 4.0–23.0), highlighting the much larger risk in unvaccinated populations.

It is thought that there may be an increased risk for developing GBS from pandemic influenza vaccinations such as H1N1 (RR = 1.84; 95% CI 1.36–2.50) compared to seasonal vaccination (RR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.01–1.48). This finding is in line with the other studies showing a slight increased risk of GBS. However, other studies have failed to confirm this association.

Overall, there appears to be a consensus for a small association between influenza vaccines and GBS, but the risk is consistently very low (~ 1–3 additional GBS cases per million vaccinations) and needs to be carefully weighed against evidence supporting benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza-related complications, including an increased risk of GBS.

Key points
Large-scale prospective surveillance registers can offer key data in comparative estimations of risk.
There is rarely a zero-risk option; the risk of complications from preventable disease may be higher than risk of complications from vaccination itself, particularly in periods of high disease transmission.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZhpJv]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis confirms an increased, although overall low, risk of GBS following adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. The incidence of GBS cases per million vaccinations is lower than the estimated incidence for the 1976/1977 "swine flu" vaccination but is higher than for the modern influenza vaccine. mRNA vaccines were associated with decreased GBS risk, possibly because of a reduction in infections, including SARS-CoV-2, that may be associated with GBS during the vaccination period. Overall, the established epidemiological benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing viral transmission, hospitalization, and deaths, greatly overtake, in our opinion, the risk of developing GBS even after adenovirus-vectored vaccines. How adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines may trigger GBS is unclear and further studies should investigate the relationship between vaccine technologies and GBS to optimise patients' safety.

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalization and increased rate of cardiovascular events in older adults [^116sEsyB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has traditionally been neglected as an important acute respiratory infection (ARI) outside of childhood, thus the perceived risk in adults aged ≥ 60 years is low. Vaccines (Arexvy, GSK; ABRYSVO, Pfizer; mRESVIA, Moderna) have recently been approved in the US, Canada, and Europe for adults aged ≥ 60 years. Findings from randomized trials indicate they have similar safety profiles as the first and second doses of the Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccine, although excess rates of Guillain‐Barré syndrome have been suggested from early analyses of safety monitoring and administrative billing databases. Although usually only 20%–30% as incident as influenza, evidence suggests that RSV is significantly more likely to cause severe disease in hospitalized older adults, particularly in terms of mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and/or critical care, and hospital length of stay. This appears to be compounded in the oldest old and those with comorbidities, as the hospitalization rate for individuals aged ≥ 80 years is approximately 8 per 1000 compared to 0.5 per 1000 for those aged 45–54 years, while the relative risk for hospitalization is 2–10‐fold higher for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease than individuals without those comorbidities.

Prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic, RSV, along withand influenza, had the greatest contribution to the global acute respiratory infection burden, accounting for approximately 1.2 million deaths per year and 22 million disability‐adjusted life‐years lost in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Somewhat underappreciated is the substantial impact of these pathogens on the likelihood of cardiovascular outcomes. For example, the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is significantly greater in the weeks following an influenza diagnosis or hospitalization, as is the rate of any acute cardiovascular event following a clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed influenza. Others have shown the risk of ischemic heart disease or heart failure can be elevated for nearly a decade following pneumonia. These findings are supported by studies indicating that vaccination against influenza or pneumococcus is protective against cardiovascular events and related death, particularly in those who are already at high risk. While it appears that many types of respiratory infections are associated with subsequent cardiovascular outcomes, and that cardiac events are a common complication of laboratory‐confirmed RSV hospitalizations, especially in severe cases, there is a paucity of data comparing outcomes among older adults hospitalized due to RSV compared to other types of hospital admissions.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome in times of pandemics [^112VdEpT]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the last in line of several epidemics of infectious diseases that have been linked to the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). As threats of epidemics of emerging infectious diseases persist, this is the time to learn from the past and to advance our response to future outbreaks in terms of research and management of GBS.

In the past decade, the world confronted several pandemics of emerging infectious diseases including Zika virus and most recently Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the neurological complications reported in relation to these infectious diseases is the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rapidly progressive immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that can cause paresis in all limbs, cranial and respiratory muscles. Approximately 20% require admission at an intensive care unit (ICU), and 2%–12% die, depending on the care available.

In the past, research responses investigating a possible link between GBS and outbreaks of infectious diseases or vaccines have been delayed. This is problematic as healthcare institutions need to be able to prepare for increased incidences in patients with GBS, and public health personnel need to identify any possible mitigating factors. History now seems to repeat itself when case reports of SARS-CoV-2-related GBS are mounting, and disquiet over a possible association increases. As threats of epidemics of emerging infectious diseases persist, this is the time to learn from the past and to advance our response to future outbreaks in terms of research and management of GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UP61z]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our meta-analysis shows that the occurrence of GBS is more than twice as frequent after the first vaccine dose compared to the second one, confirming previous findings. This may be explained by an individual susceptibility triggering GBS with the very first dose and because patients experiencing serious adverse effects from the first dose might have preferred not to undergo the second one. Interestingly, only one patient experiencing GBS after both the first and the second dose of Vaxzevria was reported in the UK. The mortality rate in GBS after COVID-19 vaccination is about 5%, which is in line with the previously reported range (3–10%).

After the second and third injections in the 3-dose 100-µg group, 6.3% and 20.0% of participants reported unsolicited AEs. The most frequent unsolicited TEAEs (≥ 10%) included dyspnea, headache, injection site pain, aphthous ulcer, nasopharyngitis, and nausea.

Unsolicited treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 10.5%, 5.0%, 15.0%, and 0% of participants in the 50-, 100-, 200-µg, and placebo groups of the 1-dose vaccine groups, respectively (Table 2). Ten percent and 6.3% of participants in the 3-dose 100-µg group reported treatment-related TEAEs after the first and second injections. No unsolicited treatment-related TEAEs were noted after any injection in the 3-dose placebo group or after the third 100-µg mRNA-1345 injection. There were no unsolicited treatment-related serious AEs, AEs of special interest, medically attended AEs, fatal TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, or grade ≥ 3 TEAEs; review of unsolicited AEs of special interest did not identify reports of anaphylactic reaction, myocarditis/pericarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell palsy/facial paralysis, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, seizures, or thrombocytopenia associated with mRNA-1345 administration.

### Estimating risk of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in US Medicare-enrolled older adults following medically attended respiratory syncytial virus disease: a self-controlled case series analysis [^112nDN2U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is considered a rare complication of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza and SARS-CoV-2), however its association with RSV infection has not been studied. We performed a self-controlled case series analysis to estimate GBS risk following medically attended RSV disease among older adults.

Methods

We identified adults aged ≥ 65 years with medically attended RSV disease and incident inpatient GBS using specific ICD codes, excluding those with prior GBS, from the US Medicare claims data (2011–2024). Risk period was 1 to 42 days post-RSV disease index date; the control period encompassed -180 to -22 days and 43 to 180 days of RSV disease index date. Conditional Poisson regression estimated RSV-related GBS incidence rate ratios (IRRs), adjusting for seasonality and viral activities. Medicare data policies prohibit cell case counts < 11 from being displayed.

Results

Among 452,471 eligible patients with RSV disease, < 11 incident GBS cases occurred in the risk period and 34 during the control period. The adjusted IRR for GBS post RSV disease was 2.11 (95% CI: 1.01–4.37), consistent across sensitivity analyses of alternative risk/control periods and after excluding coinfections. The IRR increased to 2.59 (1.17–5.73) after ICD-10 code adoption, with a marked rise among patients aged ≥ 75 years (3.98 [1.45–10.91]).

Conclusion

GBS risk increases after RSV disease compared to control periods not temporally adjacent to RSV disease, with an effect particularly evident among patients aged ≥ 75 years. RSV should be recognized as one of the pathogens that may rarely lead to GBS.

### Simulation study of the effect of influenza and influenza vaccination on risk of acquiring Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115fGJZm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Seasonal influenza vaccination programs have been implemented in many jurisdictions over the past 40 years. Although influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce influenza-associated illness and death, there is conflicting evidence about whether influenza vaccine may increase the risk of acquiring Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

GBS is a rare but serious autoimmune condition. Most cases in European and North American populations involve acute, inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy. There are several less common forms of GBS, the most frequent of which are Miller Fisher syndrome and acute motor axonal neuropathy, which are more common in Asian and Latino populations. Most GBS patients require hospitalization, ≈25% experience acute respiratory failure requiring intensive care, 10%–20% are permanently disabled, and ≈4% die within 1 year of acquiring the condition. The risk for GBS is higher in males and with increasing age: the incidence in the general population ranges from a low of 0.45/100,000 person-years in girls < 10 years of age to a high of 3.7/100,000 person-years in men > 80 years of age.

Many GBS cases are preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, most commonly caused by Campylobacter jejuni. Recent studies have provided evidence that influenza illness is associated with the development of GBS and that influenza vaccination may confer a much more modestly increased risk of GBS than that from influenza virus infection, but these findings are less consistent. The possible association between GBS and influenza vaccination is frequently cited as a reason for vaccine refusal by health care workers. This refusal occurs despite evidence that the risk of acquiring GBS is markedly higher from influenza illness than from influenza vaccination. For example, previous studies estimate that influenza illness may increase the risk for GBS by up to 16- to 18-fold, whereas influenza vaccination may only increase the risk by up to 2-fold (Technical Appendix Table 1).

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in ten steps [^111cSPwD]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Preceding events

About two-thirds of patients who develop GBS report symptoms of an infection in the 6 weeks preceding the onset of the condition. These infections are thought to trigger the immune response that causes GBS. Six pathogens have been temporally associated with GBS in case–control studies: Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis E virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein–Barr virus and Zika virus. It has been suggested that other pathogens are linked to GBS on the basis of evidence from case series or epidemiological studies, but their role in the pathogenesis of GBS is uncertain –. In general, the absence of an antecedent illness does not exclude a diagnosis of GBS, as putative infections or other immunological stimuli can be subclinical.

Vaccines were first linked to GBS in 1976 when a 7.3-fold increase in the risk of GBS was observed among nonmilitary individuals in the United States who had received the 'swine' influenza vaccine. The epidemiological link between other vaccines and GBS has been examined many times since, but only two further studies showed a relationship between GBS and influenza vaccines. These studies suggested an increase of approximately one additional GBS case per one million vaccinations, which is several orders of magnitude lower than that observed for the 1976 influenza vaccine. No other vaccines have been convincingly linked to GBS.

A relationship between administration of immunobiologicals (for example, tumour necrosis factor antagonists, immune checkpoint inhibitors or type I interferons) and GBS has been reported on the basis of case series information and biological plausibility. Other events, including but not limited to surgery and malignancy, have been temporally related to GBS, but these relationships lack a clear biological rationale and the epidemiological evidence is limited.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111hrX1]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several vaccines against COVID-19 pathology, including the adenovirus-vectored Vaxzevria and the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty, have been approved for use in many countries since December 2020 and have been shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections, viral transmission, patient hospitalizations and deaths in randomized controlled trials and real-world effectiveness studies. However, the clinical trials were underpowered to detect rare adverse events such as GBS.

Soon after the start of large-scale vaccine programs, single cases and small series of GBS following vaccination with Vaxzevria were reported. In July 2021, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency issued warnings of an increased GBS risk after adenovirus-vectored vaccines. In a UK-based cohort study, excess cases of GBS per one million people receiving Vaxzevria varied from 2.3 to 2.9. On May 2023 the WHO declared the end of the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency of international with a total of 13.42 billion vaccine doses administered worldwide. The aim of this meta-analysis is to reappraise, two years after the introduction of vaccines, the epidemiological data regarding the association between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS.

Figure 6
Effectiveness of RSV vaccine for older adults against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related healthcare utilisation, including emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Note: eligible age criteria varied across the included studies. Detailed eligibility criteria for age are available in online supplemental table S2.

Four studies reported data on the safety of RSV vaccines in older adults. Injection site symptoms and systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue/tiredness or muscle pain) constituted 30.0–33.5% and 26.0–29.8% of all reported adverse events, respectively. One study reported no association between the RSV vaccine (AREXVY or ABRYSVO) and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.25) or recurrent atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91 to 0.97) compared with influenza vaccines. In a US study using a self-controlled case series approach, 95 incidents of GBS within 42 days after vaccination were observed among 3.2 million vaccine recipients. They observed the incidence of GBS following both AREXVY (attributable risk: 6.5 GBS cases per one million doses; IRR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.19 to 5.08, 24 cases in risk period, 11 cases in control period) and ABRYSVO (attributable risk: 9 GBS cases per one million doses; IRR 2.02, 95% CI: 0.93 to 4.40, 18 cases in risk period, < 11 cases in control period) vaccines within 42 days after vaccination compared with the period between 42 and 90 days postvaccination. Another US study using surveillance data sets found 4.4 and 1.8 GBS cases per one million doses of ABRYSVO and AREXVY vaccine administered, respectively.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^1123um3A]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Relation to other studies

The VAESCO consortium is one of the first groups to provide data on the association between pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome with substantial power and mostly adjuvanted vaccines. Our results are comparable with those of a study investigating the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome with non-adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine in the US, which showed an age adjusted rate ratio of 1.77 (1.12 to 2.56). In the US Vaccine Safety Datalink no increased risk of adverse events was identified after administration of 1 195 552 doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine to people aged under 18 and 4 773 956 doses to adults. Those studies made no statistical adjustment for influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections and seasonal influenza vaccination.

Influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections are a recognised risk factor for Guillain-Barré syndrome, as confirmed in our study. The association with influenza-like illness shown previously in the UK General Practice Research Database was stronger (18.0 (7.5 to 46.4) for influenza-like illness and 5.2 (3.5 to 7.6) for acute respiratory tract infections) than in our study (4.9 (1.6 to 15.5) for influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections and predominantly comprising upper respiratory tract infections).

Several vaccines have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, but controversy remains for the influenza vaccines. A recent study found no association between seasonal influenza vaccination and Guillain-Barré syndrome, whereas our study showed an increased risk. Different circumstances and differences in study design could explain this discrepancy. The previous study was a self controlled case series, had differential case verification, and used data up to 2005. In 2009, during the study period of the present study, seasonal influenza vaccinations were supplied while the pandemic was coming to its peak. As in most countries pandemic influenza vaccines became available only after the seasonal vaccination campaign, people with influenza symptoms might have had a higher uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination. If there was under-reporting of influenza-like illness in the General Practice Research Database, because patients were discouraged to visit the general practitioner for such symptoms in the UK in 2009, seasonal influenza vaccination could therefore be a proxy for influenza-like illness. This could explain why the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination was higher than expected in the General Practice Research Database.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome after exposure to influenza virus [^114kroSR]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, acquired, monophasic autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves that develops in susceptible individuals after infection and, in rare cases, after immunisation. Exposure to influenza via infection or vaccination has been associated with GBS. We review the relation between GBS and these routes of exposure. Epidemiological studies have shown that, except for the 1976 US national immunisation programme against swine-origin influenza A H1N1 subtype A/NJ/76, influenza vaccine has probably not caused GBS or, if it has, rates have been extremely low (less than one case per million vaccine recipients). By contrast, influenza-like illnesses seem to be relevant triggering events for GBS. The concerns about the risk of inducing GBS in mass immunisation programmes against H1N1 2009 do not, therefore, seem justified by the available epidemiological data. However, the experiences from the 1976 swine flu vaccination programme emphasise the importance for active and passive surveillance to monitor vaccine safety.

Background

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculopathy, thought to be autoimmune, which has been reported following vaccinations. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends not administering influenza vaccine to individuals who have had a history of GBS within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination if they are not at high risk of severe complications from influenza illness.

Methods

We identified GBS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California databases from 1995 into 2006 using hospital discharge codes; each medical record was neurologist-reviewed and only GBS-confirmed cases were included for follow-up. We followed confirmed cases through 2008 for vaccinations and recurrent GBS.

Results

We identified 550 cases of GBS over 33 million person-years. Following their GBS diagnoses, 989 vaccines were given to 279 of these individuals, including 405 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) administered to 107 individuals with a prior diagnosis of GBS. Among the 550 total cases of GBS, 18 initially had onset within 6 weeks of TIV; of these, 2 were revaccinated with TIV without a recurrence of GBS. Only 6 individuals of 550 (1.1%) had a second (recurrent) diagnosis of GBS. Among these 6 individuals, none had any vaccine exposure at all in the 2 months prior to the second onset of GBS.

Conclusions

In our population of over 3 million members, during an 11-year period, risk of GBS recurrence was low. There were no cases of recurrent GBS after influenza vaccination and none within 6 weeks after any vaccine.

### Sensory Guillain-Barre syndrome following the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine: report of two cases and review of literature [^113SzJ75]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Massive vaccination against COVID-19 has become a global priority. Simultaneously, concerns regarding the safety of vaccines are growing. We describe two patients who developed sensory Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) shortly after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine. We also summarize 12 published cases of GBS after ChAdOx1 vaccination, highlighting their unique clinical and paraclinical features. We propose a possible association between the risk of GBS and the ChAdOx1 vaccine and recommend surveillance for GBS following vaccination. Population-based studies are needed to determine causality and whether specific subpopulations are susceptible.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^1129xqNE]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Five European countries.

Participants

104 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and its variant Miller-Fisher syndrome matched to one or more controls. Case status was classified according to the Brighton Collaboration definition. Controls were matched to cases on age, sex, index date, and country.

Main Outcome Measures

Relative risk estimate for Guillain-Barré syndrome after pandemic influenza vaccine.

Results

Case recruitment and vaccine coverage varied considerably between countries; the most common vaccines used were adjuvanted (Pandemrix and Focetria). The unadjusted pooled risk estimate for all countries was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.0). After adjustment for influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection and seasonal influenza vaccination, receipt of pandemic influenza vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (adjusted odds ratio 1.0, 0.3 to 2.7). The 95% confidence interval shows that the absolute effect of vaccination could range from one avoided case of Guillain-Barré syndrome up to three excess cases within six weeks after vaccination in one million people.

Conclusions

The risk of occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome is not increased after pandemic influenza vaccine, although the upper limit does not exclude a potential increase in risk up to 2.7-fold or three excess cases per one million vaccinated people. When assessing the association between pandemic influenza vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome it is important to account for the effects of influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection, seasonal influenza vaccination, and calendar time.

Control for confounding

Information on the following covariates was collected with a standardised data collection form in each country: history of Guillain-Barré syndrome, Epstein-Barr virus infection, malignancy, immunosuppression, autoimmune disorder, gastrointestinal infections, influenza-like illness or upper respiratory tract infection, and other vaccinations (especially seasonal influenza vaccination). For influenza-like illness or upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, and seasonal influenza vaccination, the risk window comprised the six weeks before the index date, not including the index date itself. Seasonal influenza vaccination (2009–10 season) more than six weeks before the index date was classified as past exposure. Information on covariates was retrieved from general practice records in the UK and the Netherlands, from hospital medical records in France, and by structured interview in Sweden. In Denmark, information on covariates was obtained through chart review of the cases only and therefore could not be used for statistical adjustments.

Statistical analysis

Matched odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with multivariate conditional logistic regression. "No vaccination" in the six weeks before the index date served as the reference category. Variables considered for inclusion in the final model were those that were associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome in the univariate matched analysis at P < 0.1; they were retained in the final model if they changed the point estimate of the association between the pandemic influenza vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome by more than 10%. We conducted age stratified analyses to estimate the association with pandemic influenza vaccination in different age groups. We explored interactions between pandemic influenza vaccination and the main confounders by applying population restrictions but had insufficient power for statistical testing because of the low prevalence of exposure.

We carried out sensitivity analyses regarding disease and misclassification of exposure to pandemic influenza vaccination to assess robustness of the results. Exposure misclassification was addressed with three approaches: with all people with unknown dates of vaccination considered as exposed; with all people with unknown dates of vaccination considered as unexposed; and with all exposures more than six weeks before classified as non-exposure.

Risk estimates across countries were pooled with a meta-analytical approach to account for the differences in exposure prevalence. We used a random effects model to account for heterogeneity between countries. For all analyses significance was accepted at a two sided P < 0.05. Analyses were done in SPSS 15.0 for windows (release 15.0, 2006, SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### Guillain-barrésyndrome after high-dose influenza vaccine administration in the United States, 2018–2019 season [^116RNJQz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) identified a statistical signal for an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in days 1–42 after 2018–2019 high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) administration. We evaluated the signal using Medicare.

Methods

We conducted early- and end-of-season claims-based self-controlled risk interval analyses among Medicare beneficiaries ages ≥ 65 years, using days 8–21 and 1–42 postvaccination as risk windows and days 43–84 as control window. The VSD conducted chart-confirmed analyses.

Results

Among 7 453 690 IIV3-HD vaccinations, we did not detect a statistically significant increased GBS risk for either the 8- to 21-day (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–3.44) or 1- to 42-day (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.78–2.18) risk windows. The findings from the end-of-season analyses were fully consistent with the early-season analyses for both the 8- to 21-day (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.92–2.91) and 1- to 42-day (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.70–1.79) risk windows. The VSD's chart-confirmed analysis, involving 646 996 IIV3-HD vaccinations, with 1 case each in the risk and control windows, yielded a relative risk of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.06–15.99).

Conclusions

The Medicare analyses did not exclude an association between IIV3-HD and GBS, but it determined that, if such a risk existed, it was similar in magnitude to prior seasons. Chart-confirmed VSD results did not confirm an increased risk of GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome following influenza vaccination: a 15-year nationwide population-based case-control study [^111m25XF]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large nationwide epidemiological study, influenza vaccination preceded GBS in only 1.5% of all cases. Vaccination resulted in a 1.9‐fold (95% CI 1.1–3.4) temporarily increased risk of GBS occurrence; an increase which was evident for only 1 month after the immunization. The RR of GBS after vaccination was slightly higher (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.2) in older patients (> 70 years), who may be more prone to various exposures provoking the immune system, for example, vaccines, thus contributing to the overall incidence peak in older patients. In the previous meta‐analyses, the RR of GBS after pandemic influenza vaccination was slightly higher (OR 2.4) than that found in our nationwide population (OR 1.9). This might be related to pandemic vaccines yielding a higher relative GBS risk (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4–2.5) compared to seasonal vaccines (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), as proposed in another meta‐analysis. Another explanation could be the higher relative impact on GBS risk in younger individuals (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.6–3.4) compared with older individuals (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.2) who constitute the majority of seasonal vaccine recipients. Other self‐controlled case series studies of the association between GBS and seasonal influenza vaccines after 1976 reported the risk increase to be questionable or minimal, with RRs of 0.6 (95% CI 0.2–1.9) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2–2.0) assessed within 30 and 42 days, respectively. Our study adds to the literature by providing strong evidence in favor of an increased risk of GBS within 1 month of influenza vaccination. The risk of GBS has previously been reported to peak within the first 2–4 weeks post influenza vaccination, consistent with our findings. Importantly, influenza infection itself has been reported to carry a seven‐ to 16‐fold increased risk of GBS. This is in line with our previous findings that either infections treated by community antimicrobial drugs (OR 3.5, 95% CI 3.0–4.1) or in‐hospital respiratory tract infections (OR 14.7, 95% CI 8.5–25.6) are strongly associated with a subsequent increased GBS risk. Therefore, any temporary RR increase of GBS following vaccination should be weighed against the potential large benefits of vaccination against developing severe influenza, thus hindering influenza‐related complications; not only GBS, but first and foremost pneumonia, hospitalization, possibly cardiovascular events, and death.

TABLE 2
Association between influenza vaccination and Guillain–Barré syndrome

Stratification by calendar time, gender and age showed similar results for the association between influenza vaccination and GBS (Table 2), yet with limited statistical precision. For individuals aged less than 70 years, the association tended to be weaker (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.6–3.4) than for older individuals (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.2; Table 2).

Within the full study period, 723 unique GBS patients received 3888 influenza vaccinations at any time, and 6664 unique controls received 39,452 influenza vaccinations. Thus, only 0.5% (n = 20/3888) of all influenza vaccinations among GBS cases and 0.3% of those in controls (n = 119/39,452) occurred within 1 month of the index date. Assuming a causal association between recent influenza vaccination and GBS, the population attributable fraction was 0.4%. In our additional case‐crossover analysis of influenza vaccination, the 1‐month GBS risk estimate was higher but more statistically imprecise compared to the main analysis, with an OR of 2.9 (95% CI 1.2–6.8).

The increased GBS risk was confined to 1 month after influenza vaccination only. In the second to fifth months after influenza vaccination, we observed no increased GBS risk (ORs ranged from 0.6 [95% CI 0.3–1.1] to 0.9 [95% CI 0.5–1.8]). In a narrowed 14‐day risk window, we found only five influenza‐vaccinated cases and 50 controls, yielding a more imprecise GBS OR of 1.0 (95% CI 0.4–2.6). In a broadened 60‐day risk window, the GBS OR was 1.2 (95% CI 0.8–1.9).

INTRODUCTION

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a severe immune‐mediated neuropathy resulting in an acute or subacute progressive bilateral symmetric weakness. In approximately 25% of GBS cases symptoms are preceded by an infection which may have induced an aberrant immunological response. Similarly, stimulation of the immune system by different vaccines have been investigated (e.g. tetanus toxoid‐containing vaccines, polio vaccines, and COVID‐19 vaccines). However, apart from the association between influenza vaccine and GBS, evidence for associations between GBS and other vaccines is weak. Patone et al. recently undertook a self‐controlled case series study to investigate hospital admissions from neurological complications in the 28 days after a first vaccination against COVID‐19 with either ChAdOx1nCoV‐19 (n = 20,417,752) or BNT162b2 (n = 12,134,782) and after a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive test (n = 2,005,280) in England between 1 December 2020 and 31 May 2021. They found an increased risk of GBS after ChAdOx1nCoV‐19 vaccination (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–2.6) but not after BNT162b2 vaccination (IRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5–1.4). A more profoundly increased risk of GBS was observed in the 1–28‐day period after a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive test (IRR 5.3, 95% CI 3.0–9.2). For influenza vaccines, current evidence suggests a small elevated risk of GBS after influenza vaccination, but long‐term data are limited. In 1976, the H1N1 swine influenza vaccine programme was first associated with an estimated relative risk (RR) of GBS of 7–8 in vaccinated individuals. More recently, two meta‐analyses showed an increased risk of GBS within 6 weeks following seasonal or 2009 H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 2.4 [95% CI 1.4–4.0] and 2.4 [95% CI 1.6–3.7], respectively). A meta‐analysis of 29 studies conducted between 1981 and 2014 suggested a weaker association between any influenza vaccine, whether seasonal or pandemic, and GBS, with an overall RR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.7). Large population‐based studies are important to clarify the exact magnitude and duration of GBS risk following influenza vaccination. We determined the risk of GBS following seasonal influenza vaccination from 2002 to 2016 in prospectively collected data using the Danish national healthcare registries.

### Early safety findings among persons aged ≥ 60 years who received a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine-United States, may 3, 2023-April 14, 2024 [^1137hv6u]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review provides early findings from V-safe and VAERS surveillance systems during the first months of GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccine administration among U.S. adults aged ≥ 60 years. The findings in this report are generally consistent with those from safety data collected in prelicensure clinical trials, including the observance of GBS cases.

In V-safe, injection site and systemic reactions were more frequently reported among those who received GSK than among those who received Pfizer vaccine; few participants reported receiving medical care. Expected vaccination reactions (e.g. pain in extremity, headache, and fatigue) were among the most frequently reported events among nonserious VAERS reports. Using VAERS data, estimated GBS reporting rates after RSV vaccination among persons aged ≥ 60 years were 4.4 and 1.8 reports per million doses of Pfizer and GSK vaccine administered, respectively.

VAERS reporting rates of GBS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination were used to estimate expected background rates of GBS in this study population; no excess risk for GBS was observed after mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations in active Vaccine Safety Datalink surveillance. VAERS reporting rates for GBS among adults aged ≥ 65 years were 0.43 and 0.54 per million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, respectively ****. Thus, using the reporting rate for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines as an estimate of background rate, reports of GBS after RSV vaccination were more common than expected. Two deaths among vaccine recipients who had been diagnosed with GBS were reported.

Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, V-safe is a voluntary program, and data might not be representative of the vaccinated population. Second, VAERS is a passive surveillance system and is subject to reporting biases, underreporting (especially of nonserious events), and incomplete data reporting. Third, VAERS generally cannot determine causal associations between adverse events and vaccination. Finally, because these data do not include a comparison group of unvaccinated persons with a similar likelihood of receiving an RSV vaccine, estimating the magnitude of risk for serious but rare outcomes (e.g. GBS) after vaccination is not possible.

The emergence of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented an unprecedented global challenge. Vaccines against COVID have been developed to date. Covid-19 has been linked with the development of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. We report three cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and one case of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), presenting to a Tasmanian hospital, and review 15 other reported cases and discuss likely immunopathology. Nearly all reported cases of post-COVID-19 vacciation inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are linked to AstraZeneca vaccination and a variant with bifacial weakness is the most reported form of GBS globally.

### Reports of Guillain-Barrésyndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in the United States [^1122McjD]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Of 10 deaths reported among individuals aged 57 through 88 years, GBS was the documented cause of death after medical record and death certificate review for 7 individuals. Increasing age is associated with a poorer GBS prognosis and an increased mortality risk. Of these deaths, 8 occurred after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination; however, there was no epidemiologic evidence to suggest an association between either mRNA vaccine and GBS. There were 2 deaths reported after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. In 1 death, the individual was noted to have onset of GBS symptoms at 70 days after vaccination, which is outside an epidemiologically accepted risk interval to assume an association between vaccination and GBS. The other individual was noted to have symptom onset 5 days after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination; GBS was documented as the cause of death. Based on the available evidence, it is biologically plausible that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination may have been associated with the death, although definitively establishing such an association is difficult with the available information and conclusions about causality cannot be made in this observational study. Under COVID-19 vaccine Emergency Use Authorization regulations, clinicians and health care institutions are required to report deaths and life-threatening events and other specified serious adverse events that occur after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS regardless of the potential association of vaccination with these outcomes. These reporting requirements are different from those for other licensed and routinely recommended vaccines; therefore, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between numbers of deaths reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination and deaths after vaccines routinely administered to older adults.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome following influenza vaccination [^114nshai]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

An unexplained increase in the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) occurred among recipients of the swine influenza vaccine in 1976–1977. Guillain-Barre syndrome remains the most frequent neurological condition reported after influenza vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) since its inception in 1990.

Objective

To evaluate trends of reports to VAERS of GBS following influenza vaccination in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

VAERS is the US national spontaneous reporting system for adverse events following vaccination. Reports of GBS in persons 18 years or older following influenza vaccination were evaluated for each influenza season from July 1, 1990, through June 30, 2003. The number of people vaccinated was estimated from the National Health Interview Survey and US census data. Beginning in 1994, active follow-up was conducted to verify GBS diagnosis and obtain other clinical details.

Main Outcome Measure

Reporting rates of GBS following influenza vaccination over time.

Results

From July 1990 through June 2003, VAERS received 501 reports of GBS following influenza vaccination in adults. The median onset interval (13 days) was longer than that of non-GBS reports of adverse events after influenza vaccine (1 day) (P < .001). The annual reporting rate decreased 4-fold from a high of 0.17 per 100,000 vaccinees in 1993–1994 to 0.04 in 2002–2003 (P < .001). A GBS diagnosis was confirmed in 82% of reports. Preceding illness within 4 weeks of vaccination was identified in 24% of reported cases.

Conclusions

From 1990 to 2003, VAERS reporting rates of GBS after influenza vaccination decreased. The long onset interval and low prevalence of other preexisting illnesses are consistent with a possible causal association between GBS and influenza vaccine. These findings require additional research, which can lead to a fuller understanding of the causes of GBS and its possible relationship with influenza vaccine.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome surveillance during national influenza vaccination campaign, new york, U.S. A., 2009 [^1159Zj7u]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In the fall of 1976, the outbreak of a swine-origin influenza virus prompted a mass vaccination campaign in the United States. Although an influenza epidemic did not occur, epidemiologic investigations demonstrated a small but significant risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) among adult vaccine recipients within 6 weeks after vaccination. Some studies found that a relatively small risk extended slightly beyond the 6 weeks after vaccination. The estimated attributable risk for GBS after swine influenza vaccination was slightly less than 1 case per 100,000 persons vaccinated. Because of this association, GBS surveillance was established for the 3 subsequent influenza seasons; however, no increased risk for GBS was identified after influenza vaccination. The underlying reason for the association with the 1976 vaccination remains unknown.

In April 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was first identified. Its emergence and rapid global spread prompted swift development of a new vaccine. The previous association of GBS with the 1976 vaccine raised concerns about the potential for a similar association with the new A(H1N1)pdm09 monovalent vaccines.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^1139eRJc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In a source population of around 50 million people in Europe we could not find any association between adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (adjusted odds ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.7). The increased risk in the unadjusted analyses disappeared when we adjusted for the apparent strong confounding of influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections and seasonal influenza vaccination. Based on the 95% confidence interval for the adjusted odds ratio it is unlikely that the relative risk is above 2.7. Thus it is unlikely that there would be more than one excess case of Guillain-Barré syndrome per 340 000 vaccinated people (or three per million) given a risk window of six weeks and a background incidence rate of 1.5 per 100 000 person years.

The effects of adjustment for seasonal influenza vaccination were strong but differed between countries, which could be explained by differences in vaccination strategies. In the Netherlands the population targeted for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine overlapped largely with the population targeted for seasonal influenza vaccination, whereas in the UK it only partially overlapped as not all older people were targeted for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccination. In Sweden, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine was made available to the entire population, but there was under-reporting of seasonal influenza vaccination so that we could not appropriately adjust for it.

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ppaK2]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-acting monoclonal antibody nirsevimab and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines became available for prevention of severe RSV-associated disease in 2023. While clinical trials showed good efficacy and safety, their restrictive inclusion criteria, small sample sizes and short follow-up limit generalisability. We aimed to summarise real-world evidence on the effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults.

Methods

A living systematic review and meta-analysis, with 5monthly updated searches in three databases was performed. Eligible studies were published from 1 December 2022 to 10 March 2025. Meta-analyses for the effectiveness of nirsevimab and RSV vaccines were carried out using random-effects model. Safety data were summarised narratively.

Results

A total of 50 publications, covering approximately 7.6million people, were included. Nirsevimab showed 80.7% effectiveness (95%CI: 75.7% to 85.7%; seven studies) against RSV-related emergency department visits, 80.7% (95% CI: 76.1% to 85.2%; 17 studies) against hospital admissions and 75.6% (95% CI: 63.3% to 87.9%; eight studies) against intensive care unit admissions. The effectiveness of RSV vaccines for older adults against RSV-related hospital admissions was 79.6% (95% CI: 73.8% to 85.3; three studies). No effectiveness data were available for RSV maternal vaccine. No severe adverse events were reported for nirsevimab, while RSV vaccines in older adults had fewer than 10 Guillain-Barré syndrome cases per million doses. No severe adverse events were reported for RSV maternal vaccine, although evidence was limited.

Conclusions

Our review demonstrated high effectiveness of nirsevimab in reducing RSV-related healthcare utilisation in infants and a favourable safety profile. More evidence is needed for evaluating RSV vaccines in pregnant people and older adults.

### Real-world effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab, RSV maternal vaccine and RSV vaccines for older adults: a living systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125d6uC]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

In response, passive immunisation with nirsevimab for infants and the maternal vaccine (bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) protein-based vaccine, (ABRYSVO, Pfizer)) for pregnant people between 24 and 36 completed weeks of gestation (varied by country) was approved in Europe in October 2022, the UK in November 2022 and the United States in July 2023. Several clinical trials have been conducted, demonstrating favourable safety and efficacy for these products. For the maternal vaccine, a clinical trial of the RSVpreF3 (AREXVY, GSK) was halted due to an observed increase in premature births. Only the ABRYSVO (Pfizer) vaccine has been licensed for use during pregnancy, but concerns about the risk of premature births remain. In addition, for older adults, three RSV vaccines — AREXVY (GSK), ABRYSVO (Pfizer) and mRESVIA (Moderna) — were also approved after demonstrating favourable efficacy and good safety profiles in clinical trials. However, clinical trials are often limited in their generalisability to real-world settings due to the exclusion of individuals with risk factors and the relatively small sample sizes as reflected in the wide 95% CIs. Rare or very rare serious adverse events such as hypersensitivity reactions, adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, pre-eclampsia) or cardiovascular or neurological conditions (eg, atrial fibrillation, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)) may not have been detected in clinical trials. Furthermore, the efficacy of the performance of nirsevimab and vaccines needs to be established in scenarios reflecting those encountered by public health agencies. Since their approval, routine RSV immunisation campaigns have been implemented in countries across Europe, including the UK, and in North America, providing real-world evidence. A growing evidence base demonstrating effectiveness and safety is vital primarily to provide reassurance and build confidence in the vaccines and immunisation programmes, as well as inform decision-makers and policy. To our knowledge, no systematic review has yet assessed the effectiveness and safety of nirsevimab and RSV vaccines using real-world data. To inform immunisation policy, address gaps in evidence from clinical trials and help decision-making, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness and safety of RSV prophylaxis in reducing RSV-related healthcare utilisation among infants and older adults in real-world settings.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome following influenza vaccination: a 15-year nationwide population-based case-control study [^114pH4xT]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Influenza vaccination may increase the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) due to an elicited immune response, but the exact magnitude and duration of risk is unclear and hence the aim of this study.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective nationwide population-based case-control study of prospectively collected data on all patients with first-time hospital-diagnosed GBS in Denmark between 2002 and 2016 and 10 age-, sex- and index date-matched population controls per case. The primary exposure was incident influenza vaccination 1month prior to admission with GBS. We used medical registries to ascertain a complete hospital contact history of pre-existing morbidities. To examine duration of GBS risk, we repeated the analysis for five consecutive 1-month risk periods following vaccination.

Results

Of the 1295 GBS cases and 12,814 controls, 20 cases (1.5%) and 119 controls (0.9%) had received an influenza vaccination within the last month, yielding a comorbidity-adjusted odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.1–3.2) for GBS. Stratified analyses by calendar time, gender and age showed similar results. The increased risk of GBS was largely confined to 1month following influenza vaccination. The population-attributable fraction of GBS from influenza vaccination in Denmark was 0.4%.

Conclusions

Influenza vaccination was associated with a slightly elevated risk of GBS occurrence within 1month after vaccination. However, only 1.5% of GBS cases in Denmark are associated with recent influenza vaccination. Thus, the benefit of influenza vaccines in preventing influenza infections and associated morbidity and mortality needs to be weighed against the small absolute risk of GBS.

### Evaluation of Guillain-Barrésyndrome among recipients of influenza vaccine in 2000 and 2001 [^113WAe53]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The 1976–1977 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), especially within 6 weeks after vaccination. A 2004 IOM report concluded that evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between subsequent influenza vaccine formulations and GBS. Studies published after the IOM report have been limited by passively reported data or lack of validation of coded diagnoses.

Purpose

To evaluate whether influenza vaccine is associated with GBS.

Methods

Controlled observational study using national data from the Medicare program, which ensures a predominantly elderly population. People included had a Medicare claim for influenza vaccination during September-December in 2000 or 2001. Medical records were reviewed to classify definite, probable, or possible GBS (or not a case) using a standardized case definition. In a risk interval design, the incidence rate of GBS during Weeks 0–6 after vaccination (exposed period) was compared to Weeks 9–14 after vaccination (comparison period). Data collection occurred during 2003–2007, and analysis was conducted during 2007–2009.

Results

Primary analysis included 22.2 million vaccinees, among whom 164 definite or probable GBS cases with onset during Weeks 0–6 or 9–14 were identified. The incidence rate ratio (IRR [95% CIs]) based on the GBS rate in the vaccine-exposed versus comparison periods, was 1.04 (0.76, 1.43) for combined years; 0.86 (0.52, 1.41) among people vaccinated in 2000; and 1.21 (0.79, 1.86) among people vaccinated in 2001. Secondary analysis additionally included 74 possible GBS cases; results were similar.

Conclusions

Overall, the results do not support an association between influenza vaccine receipt and GBS among the elderly for the years studied (2000–2001 and 2001–2002 formulations).

### Reports of Guillain-Barrésyndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in the United States [^1111fg9B]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Because of historical associations between vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the condition was a prespecified adverse event of special interest for COVID-19 vaccine monitoring.

Objective

To evaluate GBS reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and compare reporting patterns within 21 and 42 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using US VAERS reports submitted during December 2020 to January 2022. GBS case reports verified as meeting the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS in US adults after COVID-19 vaccination were included.

Exposures

Receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Descriptive analyses of GBS case were conducted. GBS reporting rates within 21 and 42 days after Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 vaccination based on doses administered were calculated. Reporting rate ratios (RRRs) after receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vs BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 within 21- and 42-day postvaccination intervals were calculated. Observed-to-expected (OE) ratios were estimated using published GBS background rates.

Results

Among 487 651 785 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 17 944 515 doses (3.7%) were Ad26.COV2.S, 266 859 784 doses (54.7%) were BNT162b2, and 202 847 486 doses (41.6%) were mRNA-1273. Of 295 verified reports of individuals with GBS identified after COVID-19 vaccination (12 Asian [4.1%], 18 Black [6.1%], and 193 White [65.4%]; 17 Hispanic [5.8%]; 169 males [57.3%]; median [IQR] age, 59.0 [46.0–68.0] years), 275 reports (93.2%) documented hospitalization. There were 209 and 253 reports of GBS that occurred within 21 days and 42 days of vaccination, respectively. Within 21 days of vaccination, GBS reporting rates per 1 000 000 doses were 3.29 for Ad26.COV.2, 0.29 for BNT162b2, and 0.35 for mRNA-1273 administered; within 42 days of vaccination, they were 4.07 for Ad26.COV.2, 0.34 for BNT162b2, and 0.44 for mRNA-1273. GBS was more frequently reported within 21 days after Ad26.COV2.S than after BNT162b2 (RRR = 11.40; 95% CI, 8.11–15.99) or mRNA-1273 (RRR = 9.26; 95% CI, 6.57–13.07) vaccination; similar findings were observed within 42 days after vaccination (BNT162b2: RRR = 12.06; 95% CI, 8.86–16.43; mRNA-1273: RRR = 9.27; 95% CI, 6.80–12.63). OE ratios were 3.79 (95% CI, 2.88–4.88) for 21-day and 2.34 (95% CI, 1.83–2.94) for 42-day intervals after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and less than 1 (not significant) after BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccination within both postvaccination periods.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found disproportionate reporting and imbalances after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, suggesting that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was associated with increased risk for GBS. No associations between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and risk of GBS were observed.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

CDC will monitor adverse events, including cases of GBS, ADEM, and other inflammatory neurologic events after RSV vaccination through VAERS and the Vaccine Safety Datalink). CDC will also prioritize estimating vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization. These data will be evaluated by CDC and ACIP as soon as they are available.

According to FDA postmarketing requirements and commitments, GSK will conduct a study evaluating risk for GBS, ADEM, and atrial fibrillation after vaccination with RSVPreF3. Pfizer will conduct two studies, one evaluating risk for GBS and a second evaluating risk for atrial fibrillation after vaccination with RSVpreF. Pfizer will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a second RSVpreF dose in a subset of participants in the main phase 3 trial; GSK will evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of RSVPreF3 revaccination as part of its main phase 3 trial.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^115nKUNN]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, new monovalent adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines were introduced in Europe. Documented immunogenicity and safety was in line with the CHMP Note for Guidance, but safety data were limited. Vaccination campaigns started in autumn 2009 at the peak of the pandemic in Europe.

A concern with the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine was the possible occurrence of neuroimmunological adverse events, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. A more than sevenfold increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome was observed with the swine origin influenza A (H1N1) subtype A/NJ/76 vaccine applied in the United States in 1976, when the vaccination campaign had to be discontinued abruptly. Subsequent prospective surveillance studiesand retrospective epidemiological studieson seasonal influenza vaccines used in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1992, 1993, and beyond showed no or modest increases (up to twofold) in risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Even though the studies repeatedly showed risk estimates well below the sevenfold increase of 1976, they do not provide reassurance that there is no increase in risk after seasonal influenza vaccination. Small increases might surface only during mass vaccination campaigns.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute polyneuropathy, which, in Europe, mostly presents as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy leading to progressive symmetrical paresis. Guillain-Barré syndrome is fatal in 3–10% of cases and leads to disability for more than six months in 20%. The risk increases with age; reported incidence rates range between 0.4 and 4 per 100 000 person years.

The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not fully understood, but it is usually preceded by specific gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. Some infections might induce the production of cross reactive antibodies to neural gangliosides, which cause inflammatory neural damage. In 2008, Nachamkin et al reported that 1976 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine was capable of inducing cross reactive anti-GM1 in mice, supporting a causal relation between the vaccination and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Influenza vaccination may increase the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) due to an elicited immune response, but the exact magnitude and duration of risk is unclear and hence the aim of this study.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective nationwide population‐based case–control study of prospectively collected data on all patients with first‐time hospital‐diagnosed GBS in Denmark between 2002 and 2016 and 10 age‐, sex‐ and index date‐matched population controls per case. The primary exposure was incident influenza vaccination 1 month prior to admission with GBS. We used medical registries to ascertain a complete hospital contact history of pre‐existing morbidities. To examine duration of GBS risk, we repeated the analysis for five consecutive 1‐month risk periods following vaccination.

Results

Of the 1295 GBS cases and 12,814 controls, 20 cases (1.5%) and 119 controls (0.9%) had received an influenza vaccination within the last month, yielding a comorbidity‐adjusted odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.1–3.2) for GBS. Stratified analyses by calendar time, gender and age showed similar results. The increased risk of GBS was largely confined to 1 month following influenza vaccination. The population‐attributable fraction of GBS from influenza vaccination in Denmark was 0.4%.

Conclusions

Influenza vaccination was associated with a slightly elevated risk of GBS occurrence within 1 month after vaccination. However, only 1.5% of GBS cases in Denmark are associated with recent influenza vaccination. Thus, the benefit of influenza vaccines in preventing influenza infections and associated morbidity and mortality needs to be weighed against the small absolute risk of GBS.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^1167pcjz]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

We addressed important confounders by matching (age, sex, calendar time, and country) and by adjusting in a multivariate analysis. Adjustment for influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection and seasonal influenza vaccination had strong effects on the risk estimates and caused the pooled estimate to reduce from 2.8 to 1.0. Both factors were positively associated with pandemic influenza vaccination and also with Guillain-Barré syndrome. In particular seasonal influenza vaccination and pandemic influenza vaccination were strongly associated with each other and adjustment for seasonal vaccination had the most pronounced effect on the effect estimate, as shown in table 5, both in the UK and the Netherlands. As argued above, seasonal influenza vaccination could be a proxy for being at high risk for complications associated with influenza or for having influenza symptoms as the seasonal vaccination was supplied at the beginning of the pandemic when there was fear of the consequences and the pandemic influenza vaccination was not yet supplied.

Residual confounding will exist for the countries where information on influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection or seasonal influenza vaccination was (partly) unavailable, such as in Denmark, Sweden (seasonal vaccination), and France. Differential recording of risk factors for Guillain-Barré syndrome cannot be ruled out and hence more information regarding these risk factors might have been available for cases than for controls, especially if cases were recruited through neurologists. This would have resulted in an underestimated risk. Recall bias in the Swedish data cannot be ruled out as information was gathered from cases and controls by interview. In the UK information on covariates was obtained similarly for cases and controls, showing slightly less impact of influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection, and the adjusted risk estimate showed no association. The relatively low impact of influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infection on Guillain-Barré syndrome in the UK could also be the consequence of non-differential false negative misclassification of infections: patients were advised not to visit their general practitioner for influenza-like illness.

### Guillain-barre syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe [^1161oAx3]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

The test for homogeneity in effect estimates across the four countries was not significant (P = 0.40), but, because of lack of power of the test and the differences observed, we used a random effects model for the weighted pooling. The crude matched risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome was 2.8 (1.3 to 6.0). The random effects risk estimate adjusted for seasonal influenza vaccination and influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections for the Netherlands, UK, and Sweden was 1.0 (0.3 to 2.7, P = 0.81 for homogeneity). As Swedish data did not capture seasonal influenza vaccination well and might be subject to selection and recall bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis without Sweden. The pooled adjusted odds ratio was 0.7 (0.2 to 2.5) (table 6). Denmark could not be included in the adjusted analyses because information on influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections and seasonal influenza vaccination was unavailable for the controls.

### Early safety findings among persons aged ≥ 60 years who received a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine-United States, may 3, 2023-April 14, 2024 [^111btUwa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

V-safe is a voluntary, active U.S. surveillance system that sends web surveys to enrolled participants on days 0–7 after vaccination, based on the reported vaccination date. § V-safe surveys for adults aged ≥ 60 years who received an RSV vaccine were available starting October 20, 2023. Daily surveys include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts experienced. Participants reporting medical care for symptoms are also prompted to complete a VAERS report.

VAERS accepts reports of adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public (5). Reports to VAERS generally cannot be used to determine causal associations between adverse events and vaccination. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms (MedDRA PTs) are assigned by VAERS staff members to signs, symptoms, and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports. ** Reports of serious events (including death) to VAERS during May 3, 2023–April 14, 2024, and relevant available medical records were reviewed by CDC experts to form a clinical impression of each reported outcome †† (6). Using selected MedDRA PTs, a search was performed to identify outcomes of interest, including GBS and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), multiple cases of which were identified in clinical reviews of serious reports. §§

Symptoms and health impacts reported during the week after RSV vaccination were described for V-safe participants aged ≥ 60 years who were vaccinated during May 3, 2023–April 14, 2024, and completed one or more daily surveys. Primary VAERS adverse event reports after RSV vaccination for persons aged ≥ 60 years were described by serious and nonserious classification and MedDRA PTs. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Reporting rates for GBS reports that met the Brighton Collaboration case definition (6) were estimated using available doses administered as the denominator. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. ***

### Guillain-barrésyndrome – a classical autoimmune disease triggered by infection or vaccination [^115ctCAC]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune disorder, the incidence of which is estimated to be 0.6–4/100,000 person/year worldwide. Often, GBS occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal microbial infection. The disorder is sub-acute developing over the course of hours or days up to 3 to 4 weeks. About a third of all cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection. C. jejuni strains isolated from GBS patients have a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) with a GM1-like structure. Molecular mimicry between LOS and the peripheral nerves as a cause of GBS was demonstrated in animal models of human GBS. Following the "swine flu" virus vaccine program in the United States in 1976, an increase in incidence of GBS was observed and the calculated relative risk was 6.2. Later studies have found that influenza vaccines contained structures that can induce anti-GM1 (ganglioside) antibodies after inoculation into mice. More recent information has suggested that the occurrence of GBS after currently used influenza and other vaccines is rare. GBS involves genetic and environmental factors, may be triggered by infections or vaccinations, and predisposition can be predicted by analyzing some of these factors.

### SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and neuroimmunological disease: a review [^112ybw86]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The temporal association between the occurrence of neurological diseases, many autoimmune diseases, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been topically interesting and remains hotly debated both in the medical literature and the clinic. Given the very low incidences of these events both naturally occurring and in relation to vaccination, it is challenging to determine with certainty whether there is any causative association and most certainly what the pathophysiology of that causation could be.

Observations

Data from international cohorts including millions of vaccinated individuals suggest that there is a probable association between the adenovirus-vectored vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Further associations between other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and GBS or Bell palsy have not been clearly demonstrated in large cohort studies, but the possible rare occurrence of Bell palsy following messenger RNA vaccination is a topic of interest. It is also yet to be clearly demonstrated that any other neurological diseases, such as central nervous system demyelinating disease or myasthenia gravis, have any causative association with vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 using any vaccine type, although it is possible that vaccination may rarely trigger a relapse or worsen symptoms or first presentation in already-diagnosed or susceptible individuals.

Conclusions and Relevance

The associated risk between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and GBS, and possibly Bell palsy, is slight, and this should not change the recommendation for individuals to be vaccinated. The same advice should be given to those with preexisting neurological autoimmune disease.

### Simulation study of the effect of influenza and influenza vaccination on risk of acquiring Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^117FmXsE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our findings provide reassurance that influenza vaccination reduces individual risk of GBS except under conditions of low influenza incidence and/or low vaccine effectiveness. Even under those circumstances, in which the absolute risk of GBS may be raised by vaccination, the excess risk is small (in most cases, less than the generally quoted estimate of 1 in 1 million). The protective benefits of influenza vaccination are most pronounced for populations in which influenza incidence rates are higher (i.e. young children and the elderly, although effectiveness may be muted) and in those with a higher background risk for GBS (males and older persons). Influenza vaccination is an important population health intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality. Beyond these benefits, the tendency of influenza vaccination to reduce a person's overall risk of acquiring GBS under many conditions (although the absolute risk differences are extremely small) should strengthen confidence in the safety of influenza vaccination and allow health professionals to better put the risk of GBS in context when communicating risks and benefits to potential vaccinees.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome following ChAdOx1-S / nCoV-19 vaccine [^114XyvJK]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in three districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in < 20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

### Vaccine safety issues at the turn of the 21st century [^115EcUvX]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Auto-immunity

Auto-immune diseases include a wide variety of different pathologies that are often poorly defined. Associations between vaccination and chronic auto-immune conditions (eg, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disease and autoimmune encephalitis) are largely based on the concept of molecular mimicry whereby auto-antibodies are produced after exposure to an infectious agent. This phenomenon has been linked to some natural infections, including Group A Streptococcus (rheumatic fever) and measles virus (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis).

The postulated link between vaccination and auto-immune conditions has been extensively explored via controlled trials, observational studies and epidemiological analyses in multiple countries and in subpopulations. For the hepatitis B vaccine, the lack of an association with rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease or multiple sclerosis has been clearly proven. In the case of the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), there is strong evidence against an elevated risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), central demyelinating disease and multiple sclerosis. Current evidence does suggest a small elevated risk of GBS after influenza vaccination although these data are limited, and the risk is considerably lower than the risk of GBS after natural influenza infection. During the 2009/2010 influenza pandemic, there was also the evidence of a causal relationship between narcolepsy and one adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine among school-aged children who had a genetic predisposition. Nevertheless, investigators concluded that natural viral infection may have played a role in this observation as a vaccine-enhanced viral immunopathology rather than an isolated vaccine-induced autoimmune event.

Evidence gaps — research needs for influenza vaccines: There is a need for comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to analyze the benefits and harms for all included influenza vaccine types with clinical outcomes including laboratory-confirmed influenza, influenza-related hospitalizations, influenza-related mortality, and influenza-related pneumonia or lower respiratory tract disease. Additional evidence is needed in adults aged 65 years or older to further clarify the benefits and harms of the high-dose influenza vaccines. Additional large, population-based research is needed about the safety of influenza vaccines, focusing on rare potential SAEs, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Evidence about mRNA-based influenza vaccines is accumulating as several manufacturers are developing them, and future evidence on the investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccines will need to address clinical benefits and clarify the SAE findings identified in the accompanying rapid review.

Transplant Recipients

Figure 2 B shows the VE for transplant recipients, including both solid organ transplant recipients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Generally, transplant recipients had lower VE compared with the group overall; VE against ARI was substantially lower for those who had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Figure 2 B). Solid organ transplant recipients aged 60 y or older had VE against RSV-associated medically attended respiratory illness that was comparable to the group as a whole, but with a wider 95% CI, and VE was better for solid organ transplant recipients 75 years or older (Figure 2 B).

Overall, among the 17 674 transplant recipients, VE against ARI ranged from 50% to 69% and from 54.9% to 58.1% for ARI-associated hospitalization. The lowest VE estimate was for the subset of 5213 patients who received a stem cell transplant (29.4%-44.4% VE for ARI).

Risk of GBS and ITP

Table 3 shows the risks of GBS and ITP after vaccination. For all vaccine recipients (64.7% [3 070 888 of 4 746 518] received the RSVPreF3+AS01 vaccine), there was an estimated excess of 11.2 GBS cases per 1 000 000 vaccines administered. The estimated excess of GBS cases associated with the RSVPreF (Abrysvo, Pfizer) vaccine was 18.2 per 1 000 000 vaccines administered, and for the RSVPreF3+AS01 vaccine (Arexvy, GBS), the estimated excess of GBS cases was 5.2 per 1 000 000 vaccinations. There was no excess risk of ITP after vaccination for RSV from either manufacturer.

### A nationwide Guillain-Barrésyndrome epidemiological study in Spain during the COVID-19 years [^117FYWNk]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mass severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) vaccination campaigns began in 2021 raising again concerns on the possibility of an increase in GBS incidence. Several SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine‐associated GBS cases were reported, especially with ChadOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines, and, indeed, three national cohort studies in the UK, France and the United States and one meta‐analysis have found that first‐dose ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccinations were associated with an increased GBS risk.

To clarify whether the COVID‐19 pandemic influenced GBS incidence rates, the first nationwide epidemiological study of GBS was developed describing background GBS incidences in Spain, reporting regional and seasonal variations and aiming to identify background GBS incidence changes during the coronavirus pandemic.

### Effectiveness and safety of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine for US adults aged 60 years or older [^112VMaje]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our sample included 251 543 immunocompromised patients tested for RSV. Among immunocompromised patients overall, VE ranged from approximately 67% to 73% for ARI and from approximately 65% to 72% for hospitalization, for both age groups, indicating that substantial protection is conferred by the vaccine. However, among the subset of 17 674 transplant recipients, VE against ARI ranged from 50% to 69% and from 55% to 58% for ARI-associated hospitalization. The lowest VE estimate was for the subset of 5213 patients who received a stem cell transplant (29%-44% VE for ARI). Immunocompromised patients overall, except for those with stem cell transplants, still achieved substantial protection from RSV vaccination.

VE for ARI overall approximated VE for ARI-associated hospitalizations in our study and in those previously published. Hospitalization might represent more severe disease but may also be a setting more likely to prompt RSV testing in this age group, and the indication for hospitalization cannot be ascertained. The adult population in our case-control study had high prevalence of comorbid conditions, including 69.9% with cardiovascular disease and 20.9% with chronic lung disease, which were comparable for each vaccine manufacturer. The additional stress of RSV infection might adversely affect underlying heart disease or lung disease, and the need for hospitalization may reflect the complex of diseases in older individuals.

Early safety data for these vaccines during both clinical trials and initial postlicensure analyses have suggested a possible association between ITP and GBS, but the more modest sample sizes available for these analyses made these suspicions inconclusive. In the 90 days after vaccination, 102 cases of GBS and 225 cases of ITP were recorded in the EHR of more than 4.6 million vaccinated adults. Excess cases that occurred during the 6 weeks after vaccination (days 1–42) were compared with the baseline rate that occurred during the subsequent 6 weeks (days 43–90). Vaccinated adults did not have more ITP diagnoses in the 6 weeks after vaccination compared with the subsequent period. However, for GBS in a population in which approximately two-thirds received the RSVPreF3+AS01 vaccine (as observed among the study's vaccine recipients), an estimated 11.2 cases per 1 000 000 patients in excess of those expected based on the control period was observed in the first 6 weeks compared with those in days 43 to 90.

### Association between Guillain-Barrésyndrome and COVID-19 infection and vaccination: a population-based nested case-control study [^114XLiva]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Existing data regarding occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and vaccination are inconclusive. We aimed to assess the association between GBS and both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 vaccine.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 3,193,951 patients aged 16 years or older, without a diagnosis of prior GBS, from the largest health care provider in Israel. Participants were followed from January 1, 2021, until June 30, 2022, for the occurrence of GBS. Ten randomly selected controls were matched to each case of GBS on age and sex. We assessed both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine administration in the prior 6 weeks in cases and controls.

Results

Overall, 76 patients were diagnosed with GBS during follow-up and were matched to 760 controls. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 9 (11.8%) cases and 18 (2.4%) controls. An administration of COVID-19 vaccine was detected in 8 (10.5%) cases (all Pfizer-BioNTech [BNT162b2] vaccine) and 136 (17.9%) controls (134 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine). Multivariable conditional logistic regression models showed that the odds ratio for GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine administration was 6.30 (95% CI 2.55–15.56) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.17–0.96), respectively. The results were similar when exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccine administration was ascertained in the prior 4 and 8 weeks, although did not reach statistical significance for COVID-19 vaccine at 4 weeks.

Discussion

Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with increased risk of GBS, whereas Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is associated with decreased risk of GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the UK: a prospective surveillance study [^1161vVrd]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the most important public health measure to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, the vaccination programme began on the 8th of December 2020 with frontline health and social care staff, care home residents, and the elderly and then cascaded down through other priority groups so that, a year later, over 50 million people received at least one dose of one of the three vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizer- BioNTech) mRNA vaccine, ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) adenovirus-vectored vaccine or the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Monitoring for adverse event is a critical part of any vaccination programme. In the UK, health professionals and the public report suspected adverse events to the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) via the online 'Yellow Card' system. In addition, based on knowledge of previous vaccines, adverse events of special interest are designated for focused evaluation by the MHRA. In January 2021, to support the monitoring work of the MHRA, we set up a national notification system for neurological adverse events of special interest, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

GBS is a rare, acute autoimmune inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy. The risk of GBS increases with age; the overall incidence before the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated at 1.1 to 1.8 per 100 000 per year. The most common form of GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), is characterised by an areflexic, symmetrical, flaccid quadriparesis, often with sensory, autonomic and cranial nerve dysfunction and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. About two-thirds of patients with GBS have symptoms of an infection in the preceding 6 weeks, which is thought to trigger the immune response against the peripheral nervous system. Although many pathogens have been implicated, the association with GBS has been confirmed just for six in case–control studies: Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis E virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus and Zika virus. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is a trigger for GBS remains uncertain. Some vaccines have also been linked to GBS, particularly influenza vaccines.

On balance, it is unclear whether vaccination against seasonal influenza results in a net increase or decrease in the absolute risk of a person acquiring GBS. If influenza vaccination results in a small increased risk while reducing the incidence of influenza illness (which confers a much larger increase in GBS risk), then the net effect of vaccination could be a reduction in the absolute risk of GBS. The objective of this study was to assess, by using a simulation modeling approach, the effect of receipt of a seasonal influenza vaccine on a person's age- and sex-specific absolute risk of acquiring GBS.

Guillain-Barré syndrome and pandemic influenza vaccination

Unadjusted matched analyses resulted in risk estimates for Guillain-Barré syndrome with pandemic influenza vaccination that ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 in the UK, Sweden, and Netherlands (table 5). The risk estimate in Denmark, based on two exposed cases, was 9.5 (1.7 to 53). Both cases had extensive comorbidity but no influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections or gastrointestinal infections recorded in the charts. We could not calculate an estimate for France because there was only one exposed case and no exposed controls. There was no difference in risk between Pandemrix and Focetria, although the products could not be compared within countries. Two doses of pandemic influenza vaccination as provided in the Netherlands seemed to be associated with a higher risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (table 5).

The increase in risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with pandemic influenza vaccination in the unadjusted analyses disappeared when we adjusted the results for influenza-like illness/upper respiratory tract infections and seasonal influenza vaccination. Adjusted risk estimates for the Netherlands and the UK, where information on both variables was available, were 0.6 (0.1 to 4.4) and 0.7 (0.1 to 4.1), respectively (table 5).

### A nationwide Guillain-Barrésyndrome epidemiological study in Spain during the COVID-19 years [^111gx6EY]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, although this study was not designed to detect the association of GBS with vaccines, our study did not find a population‐wide increase in GBS cases during 2021, when massive SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination occurred. Other studies designed specifically to detect vaccine‐associated GBS found an association between adenovirus‐vectored vaccines and GBS but not with mRNA‐based vaccines, which were the ones used in the vast majority of the population in Spain.

Several considerations and limitations should be noted in our study. First, the cohort of patients comes from the codification of diagnosis at discharge in each hospital. These diagnoses are not confirmed later on and, thus, our cohort may include some potentially misdiagnosed cases. However, it is likely that misdiagnosis rates are low in GBS, that they remain stable across the years, and that the validity of our findings is not compromised by this limitation. Also, prior GBS diagnosis (unrelated to the current admission) may also have been reported in the registry. To minimize this bias, only patients with GBS as the main diagnosis of the active admission were selected, excluding all patients with a prior history of GBS. Furthermore, considering data are lacking on previous infections or vaccines at the individual level, the lack of association of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and GBS at the description level must be interpreted without inferring any lack of causality. Finally, data on clinical variants, electrophysiological subtypes or functional outcome are also lacking which, with such a large cohort, would have helped to define the seasonal or yearly differences in GBS features.

In summary, this is the first nationwide epidemiological GBS study performed in Spain. Our study supports that the COVID‐19 pandemic did not increase the incidence of GBS in our country. Implementation of similar, nationwide registries, particularly if they also collect real‐time and more granular, individualized information, would help in understanding deviations in expected incidences in important diseases in the event of public health emergencies, including severe post‐infectious disorders such as GBS.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131fRbY]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Case-reports/series and cohorts of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) associated with COVID-19 vaccination have been reported.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was carried out. Incidence and incidence rate ratio for a number of vaccine doses and risk of GBS, also considering the specific vaccine technology, were calculated in a random-effects model.

Results

Of 554 citations retrieved, 518 were discarded as irrelevant. We finally included 15 studies. The random effect model yielded, regardless of the vaccine technology, 1.25 (95%CI 0.21; 2.83) GBS cases per million of COVID-19 vaccine doses, 3.93 (2.54; 5.54) cases per million doses for adenovirus-vectored vaccines and 0.69 (0.38; 1.06) cases per million doses for mRNA vaccines. The GBS risk was 2.6 times increased with the first dose. Regardless of the vaccine technology, the GBS risk was not increased but disaggregating the data it was 2.37 (1.67; 3.36) times increased for adenovirus-vectored vaccines and 0.32 (0.23; 0.47) for mRNA vaccines. Mortality for GBS after vaccination was 0.10 per million doses and 4.6 per GBS cases.

Conclusions

Adenovirus-vectored vaccines showed a 2.4 times increased risk of GBS that was about seven times higher compared with mRNA-based vaccines. The decreased GBS risk associated with mRNA vaccines was possibly due to an elicited reduction of infections, including SARS-CoV-2, associated with GBS during the vaccination period. How adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines may trigger GBS is unclear and further studies should investigate the relationship between vaccine technologies and GBS risk.

### Incidence of Guillain-Barrésyndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in the vaccine safety datalink [^112HeMDf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Postauthorization monitoring of vaccines in a large population may detect rare adverse events not identified in clinical trials such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which has a background rate of 1 to 2 per 100 000 person-years.

Objective

To describe cases and incidence of GBS following COVID-19 vaccination and assess the risk of GBS after vaccination for Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen) and mRNA vaccines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used surveillance data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink at 8 participating integrated health care systems in the United States. There were 10 158 003 participants aged at least 12 years. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to February 2022.

Exposures

Ad.26.COV2.S, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine, including mRNA vaccine doses 1 and 2, December 13, 2020, to November 13, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

GBS with symptom onset in the 1 to 84 days after vaccination, confirmed by medical record review and adjudication. Descriptive characteristics of confirmed cases, GBS incidence rates during postvaccination risk intervals after each type of vaccine compared with the background rate, rate ratios (RRs) comparing GBS incidence in the 1 to 21 vs 22 to 42 days postvaccination, and RRs directly comparing risk of GBS after Ad.26.COV2.S vs mRNA vaccination, using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, site, and calendar day.

Results

From December 13, 2020, through November 13, 2021, 15 120 073 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered to 7 894 989 individuals (mean [SE] age, 46.5 [0.02] years; 8 138 318 doses received [53.8%] by female individuals; 3 671 199 doses received [24.3%] by Hispanic or Latino individuals, 2 215 064 doses received [14.7%] by Asian individuals, 6 266 424 doses received [41.4%] by White individuals), including 483 053 Ad.26.COV2.S doses, 8 806 595 BNT162b2 doses, and 5 830 425 mRNA-1273 doses. Eleven cases of GBS after Ad.26.COV2.S were confirmed. The unadjusted incidence rate of GBS per 100 000 person-years in the 1 to 21 days after Ad.26.COV2.S was 32.4 (95% CI, 14.8–61.5), significantly higher than the background rate, and the adjusted RR in the 1 to 21 vs 22 to 42 days following Ad.26.COV2.S was 6.03 (95% CI, 0.79–147.79). Thirty-six cases of GBS after mRNA vaccines were confirmed. The unadjusted incidence rate per 100 000 person-years in the 1 to 21 days after mRNA vaccines was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.7–2.4) and the adjusted RR in the 1 to 21 vs 22 to 42 days following mRNA vaccines was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.21–1.48). In a head-to-head comparison of Ad.26.COV2.S vs mRNA vaccines, the adjusted RR was 20.56 (95% CI, 6.94–64.66).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of COVID-19 vaccines, the incidence of GBS was elevated after receiving the Ad.26.COV2.S vaccine. Surveillance is ongoing.

### Reports of Guillain-Barrésyndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in the United States [^111RbvCr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that this cohort study was part of public health surveillance (45 CFR §46.102[l] [2]) and did not require evaluation by an institutional review board or informed consent. This cohort study and its results followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Setting, Population, and Incidence Definition

VAERS is a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system that is coadministered by the CDC and Food and Drug Administration. The system accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination from vaccine recipients or their parents or guardians, clinicians, health care institutions, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public regardless of whether the reported events could plausibly be associated with vaccination.VAERS reports include demographic information and medical history of the vaccinated person, type of vaccine or vaccines received, date of vaccination, possible adverse events experienced by the vaccinated person and date of onset, history of adverse events after vaccination, and current illnesses and medications. Each report is reviewed by a trained coder who assigns Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs)based on clinical information in the report and any additional information from medical records obtained through follow-up.

Among US (domestic) VAERS reports submitted from December 14, 2020, through January 28, 2022, for people ages 18 years and older who received a COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273), we searched for the following MedDRA PTs: acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy, autoimmune neuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelination, subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, immune mediated neuropathy, Guillain Barré syndrome, or Miller-Fisher syndrome. Reports with any of these MedDRA PTs were deemed possible GBS cases regardless of time to symptom onset after vaccination. Available medical records, including death certificates, were reviewed. If VAERS reports did not include medical records, we contacted clinicians or health care institutions and requested these records. Medical records were considered unavailable for review if we did not receive a response from a clinician or health care institution by April 15, 2022.

### Simulation study of the effect of influenza and influenza vaccination on risk of acquiring Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^111HMfGn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether seasonal influenza vaccination results in a net increase or decrease in the risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). To assess the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination on the absolute risk of acquiring GBS, we used simulation models and published estimates of age- and sex-specific risks for GBS, influenza incidence, and vaccine effectiveness. For a hypothetical 45-year-old woman and 75-year-old man, excess GBS risk for influenza vaccination versus no vaccination was -0.36/1 million vaccinations (95% credible interval -1.22% to 0.28) and -0.42/1 million vaccinations (95% credible interval, -3.68 to 2.44), respectively. These numbers represent a small absolute reduction in GBS risk with vaccination. Under typical conditions (e.g. influenza incidence rates > 5% and vaccine effectiveness > 60%), vaccination reduced GBS risk. These findings should strengthen confidence in the safety of influenza vaccine and allow health professionals to better put GBS risk in context when discussing influenza vaccination with patients.

### FDA requires Guillain-Barrésyndrome (GBS) warning in the… [^113aL648]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

FDA Safety Communication Purpose: To inform the public and healthcare providers that FDA has required and approved safety labeling changes to the Prescribing Information for Abrysvo manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and Arexvy manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccine. The Prescribing Information for each vaccine has been revised to include the following language in the Warnings and Precautions section: Abrysvo- The results of a postmarketing observational study suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination with Abrysvo. Arexvy- The results of a postmarketing observational study suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination with Arexvy.

GBS is a rare disorder in which the body's immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. New Warning about Risk for GBS Following Vaccination FDA conducted a postmarketing observational study that assessed the risk of GBS following vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy. Based on FDA's evaluation of data from clinical trials, reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, and the postmarketing study, FDA has determined that the overall body of evidence suggests increased risks of GBS with Abrysvo and Arexvy, but that available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. About the Study that Assessed the Risk of GBS Following Vaccination The association between vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy and GBS was evaluated among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older.

Using Medicare claims data, between May 2023 through July 2024, vaccinations with Abrysvo and Arexvy were identified through Current Procedural Terminology /Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes and National Drug Codes, and potential cases of hospitalized GBS among recipients of Abrysvo and Arexvy were identified through International Classification of Diseases codes. GBS diagnoses in claims data were confirmed by medical record review when available. The risks of GBS following vaccination with Abrysvo and Arexvy were assessed in self-controlled case series analyses using risk windows of 1 to 42 days post vaccination and control windows of 43 to 90 days post vaccination.

The analyses of all GBS cases based on claims data suggest an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination, with an estimated 9 excess cases of GBS per million doses of Abrysvo, and an estimated 7 excess cases of GBS per million doses of Arexvy administered to individuals 65 years of age and older. Background risks of GBS in study populations influence excess GBS case estimates and may differ between studies and analyses within a study, precluding direct comparisons of excess GBS case estimates from other vaccine studies or populations. While the results from the self-controlled case series analyses of this observational study suggest increased risks of GBS with Abrysvo and Arexvy, available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. About Abrysvo Abrysvo was initially approved on May 31, 2023, for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus in individuals 60 years of age and older.

### Early safety findings among persons aged ≥ 60 years… [^115z7Daa]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. The Food and Drug Administration licensed Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines in May 2023 for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In trials, Guillain-Barré syndrome was identified as a potential safety concern. What is added by this report. Findings are consistent with those from trials; reports of GBS were more common than expected background rates. What are the implications for public health practice. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive 1 dose of RSV vaccine. Population-based surveillance will evaluate the potential risk for GBS to guide ACIP recommendations. Altmetric: Tables.

Abstract In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration licensed Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In prelicensure trials, Guillain-Barré syndrome was identified as a potential safety concern. Findings from V-safe and VAERS were generally consistent with those from trials. Reporting rates of GBS after RSV vaccination in VAERS were higher than estimated expected background rates in a vaccinated population. CDC and FDA are conducting population-based surveillance to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events. Findings from these studies will help guide development of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations. 1).

The Food and Drug Administration licensed Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines on May 3 and May 31, 2023, respectively, for prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. Guillain-Barré syndrome was identified as a potential vaccine safety concern in clinical trials of both RSV vaccines. During August 4, 2023–March 30, 2024, approximately 7. 2 million adults aged ≥ 60 years received GSK RSV vaccine, and
