## Question

Back pain caused by spondylosis of the lower two lumbar segments.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management pathway for back pain due to spondylosis at the lower two lumbar segments, typically L4-L5 and L5-S1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the diagnosis and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will consider first-line conservative management, followed by interventional options if needed. After that, I will assess surgical indications and procedure selection, including segment-specific considerations for L4-L5 and L5-S1. Finally, I will synthesize an evidence-based algorithm and highlight limitations to ensure balanced, individualized decision-making.

> Let me first confirm what "spondylosis of the lower two lumbar segments" implies clinically and biomechanically, since precision matters for downstream decisions. Spondylosis encompasses age-related degenerative changes such as disc height loss, facet arthropathy, osteophytes, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, which at L4-L5 and L5-S1 can produce central and foraminal stenosis, radiculopathy, and sometimes segmental instability or degenerative spondylolisthesis; I should also keep in mind that classic neurogenic claudication is worsened by standing/walking and relieved by flexion or sitting, which should raise suspicion for lumbar spinal stenosis in the right phenotype [^114dZwgq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic priority and imaging sequence because this drives pathway selection. MRI is the first-line imaging modality for suspected stenosis or radiculopathy because it visualizes canal, foramina, discs, and ligamentum flavum, while radiographs and CT myelogram have more limited roles; flexion-extension radiographs are useful when I need to evaluate suspected dynamic instability or spondylolisthesis, particularly if symptoms or exam suggest motion-dependent pathology, and whole-spine standing radiographs help plan when alignment issues are relevant; importantly, physical examination findings alone are insufficiently reliable for diagnosing degenerative stenosis, so diagnosis is clinico-radiographic with careful correlation to exclude vascular claudication, peripheral neuropathy, or hip disease [^117Uf7iY] [^116Pckyd] [^1169Kn8x] [^114ZZF4D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before establishing a conservative foundation. I need to ensure a structured, time-limited trial of nonoperative care, typically around 6 to 12 weeks, unless red flags or progressive deficits appear; NSAIDs are reasonable first-line pharmacotherapy for chronic low back pain and often applicable in spondylosis, and while NASS 2013 judged the evidence insufficient for physical therapy as a stand-alone for stenosis, more recent systematic reviews suggest supervised programs emphasizing flexion-based exercises, aerobic conditioning such as cycling or walking, trunk strengthening, and psychologically informed approaches can help function and symptoms; axial bracing with a lumbosacral orthosis can reduce pain and improve walking distance in some patients; I should also address weight management and activity modification given BMI's negative association with lumbar segmental range of motion and likely symptom impact [^113wCkBx] [^113x8cM9] [^117V2nfr] [^114svWF5] [^11217szZ] [^115mhiRs] [^1141k2kU] [^1116TzMk] [^11193S8C].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before escalating, I should review indications for interventional procedures and set expectations. Epidural corticosteroid injections, interlaminar or caudal, can offer short-term relief in neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy, and series-based regimens may extend benefit into the medium term, but effects are generally modest and shorter-lived than surgery in appropriately selected surgical candidates; if axial pain predominates and facetogenic pain is suspected after a failed conservative course, diagnostic facet blocks may be considered, acknowledging that imaging is unreliable for predicting facet pain generators; for select patients with mild-to-moderate stenosis without dynamic instability, interspinous spacers can be considered, and if ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contributes significantly to stenosis, percutaneous lumbar decompression is an evidence-based option [^1157A2Hc] [^112pkf5b] [^115oHuZg] [^1146zDRq] [^1132jzBj] [^1125b7xP] [^111EpKuS] [^111Ca5eW] [^114rYdGg] [^111zUt2v].

> I need to check surgical indications carefully and align procedure choice with pathology and symptom dominance. Decompression alone is appropriate when leg-predominant symptoms correlate with stenosis in the absence of instability, whereas decompression with fusion is generally reserved for documented degenerative spondylolisthesis or dynamic instability, or when the decompression itself is expected to destabilize the motion segment; for patients with uncomplicated stenosis without instability, adding fusion does not show added benefit and adds morbidity and cost; I should also remember that although surgery offers durable improvement for moderate-to-severe stenosis in well-selected patients, randomized trials such as SPORT had high crossover, complicating intent-to-treat interpretations, and contemporary meta-analyses help refine fusion questions in degenerative spondylolisthesis [^114FCxJG] [^112AXDTx] [^115HV3TS] [^112LgjAj] [^112WycZ8] [^115RBKWX].

> But wait, what if the level-specific biomechanics at L4-L5 and L5-S1 shift my risk-benefit calculus. These segments bear the greatest loads and are prone to disc height loss, facet arthropathy, and translation, which can predispose to instability; laminectomy at L4-L5 in particular reduces shear stiffness on biomechanical testing, increasing the risk for postoperative spondylolisthesis, so I should evaluate preoperative and potential iatrogenic instability risk and consider whether limited fusion is warranted in select cases; moreover, preoperative assessment of sagittal alignment and spinopelvic parameters is crucial, since maldistribution of lordosis at L4-S1 and pelvic retroversion may require tailored alignment goals when planning surgery [^115B6T13] [^112oAqsa] [^114kawtm] [^114ZZF4D].

> I should double-check that the synthesized algorithm remains patient-centered and evidence-aligned. First, confirm clinico-radiographic diagnosis with MRI and symptom correlation while ruling out non-spinal mimics; second, initiate a structured conservative program for at least 6 to 12 weeks including NSAIDs as appropriate, supervised flexion-biased and aerobic exercise with trunk stabilization, and consider a lumbosacral orthosis; third, reassess function and pain, and if inadequate, consider targeted interventions such as epidural steroid injections for radiculopathy or claudication, or diagnostic facet blocks if axial pain predominates; fourth, refer for surgical evaluation if disabling symptoms persist beyond a reasonable conservative course, if progressive neurologic deficits develop, or if significant instability is present on dynamic imaging; fifth, select decompression alone for leg-dominant stenosis without instability, or decompression with fusion for spondylolisthesis, dynamic instability, or anticipated iatrogenic instability, with special caution at L4-L5 given higher shear demands [^117Uf7iY] [^113wCkBx] [^117V2nfr] [^115mhiRs] [^1157A2Hc] [^114FCxJG] [^112AXDTx] [^111EdTWf].

> Hold on, I should verify areas where my earlier assumptions might overstate certainty. I initially considered physical therapy broadly effective, but NASS 2013 rated evidence as insufficient for stand-alone PT in stenosis; however, more recent systematic reviews suggest that specific components under supervision do improve outcomes, which reconciles the apparent discrepancy and supports a nuanced PT prescription rather than a blanket endorsement; similarly, epidural injections can provide short-term benefit, yet policy-level appraisals emphasize their small, transient effect sizes compared with surgical decompression for persistent stenosis symptoms, which I must frame accurately during shared decision-making [^113x8cM9] [^117V2nfr] [^114svWF5] [^115oHuZg].

> Next, I should review evidence quality and limitations so I do not over-interpret heterogeneous data. Conservative modalities often suffer from heterogeneous interventions and small trials limiting firm conclusions, randomized surgical trials like SPORT had substantial crossover clouding ITT results, and cost-effectiveness and access considerations may temper use of high-cost procedures with marginal incremental benefit; therefore, while the stepwise algorithm is evidence-informed, duration thresholds for conservative failure and specific procedure choices should be individualized and contextualized with patient preferences and comorbidities [^112WycZ8] [^115dFXdm] [^115oHuZg].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure it is clinically actionable and balanced. Management of lower lumbar spondylosis with stenosis or radiculopathy is best approached with a structured, individualized, stepped care model that prioritizes conservative therapy, uses targeted interventional procedures when appropriate, and reserves surgery for persistent disability or instability, with meticulous attention to L4-L5 and L5-S1 biomechanics and sagittal alignment in operative planning; this approach aligns with contemporary guidelines and reviews and supports shared decision-making grounded in realistic expectations of benefit, risk, and durability [^116RBW5y] [^115B6T13].

Back pain from spondylosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 is common and often chronic, typically due to **disc degeneration** and **facet arthropathy**, and may involve nerve compression [^115sLCjW]. Management should start with **conservative care** — NSAIDs [^113wCkBx], physical therapy, and lifestyle changes — with imaging reserved for persistent or severe symptoms. If conservative measures fail, consider epidural steroid injections [^1157A2Hc] or radiofrequency ablation [^1146zDRq]; **surgery** (decompression with or without fusion) is reserved for refractory cases with instability or neurologic compromise [^112LgjAj].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

- **Disc degeneration**: Loss of disc height and hydration increases mechanical stress on facet joints and ligaments, causing pain and stiffness.

- **Facet joint arthropathy**: Degeneration and osteophytes cause localized pain, stiffness, and reduced motion [^11765TCq].

- **Nerve root compression**: Foraminal narrowing from disc collapse and osteophytes can cause radiculopathy with radiating leg pain, numbness, or weakness [^114dZwgq].

- **Spinal instability**: Degeneration may cause abnormal motion, worsening pain and disability [^115B6T13].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a thorough **history and physical examination** to characterize pain, identify neurologic deficits and functional impairment, and screen for **red flags** such as severe or progressive neurologic deficits, cauda equina syndrome, infection, or malignancy.

---

### Imaging studies

- **MRI**: Preferred for soft tissues, nerve roots, and spinal canal assessment [^116Pckyd].

- **CT**: Useful for bony detail and osteophytes [^117Uf7iY].

- **Plain radiographs**: Show disc space narrowing, osteophytes, and alignment [^114GkY1G].

- **Flexion-extension radiographs**: Assess instability [^11193S8C].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** and effective for many patients [^115sLCjW].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation [^113wCkBx].

- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or NSAID intolerance.

- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for muscle spasm.

- **Opioids**: Short-term for severe pain unresponsive to other therapies.

---

### Physical therapy and exercise

Physical therapy emphasizes **core strengthening** to improve stability and reduce pain, flexibility exercises to restore range of motion and lessen stiffness, and aerobic conditioning to enhance function while reducing pain. Patient education reinforces posture, ergonomics, and activity modification to minimize symptom provocation [^114svWF5].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **weight management** to lessen mechanical spinal load and ergonomic adjustments to optimize workplace and daily activities. Smoking cessation improves healing and may reduce degeneration.

---

## Interventional procedures

Interventions are considered when **conservative care fails** [^117JqxRq].

---

### Epidural steroid injections

For epidural steroid injections, **indications** include radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication from nerve root compression [^112pkf5b], and **effectiveness** is typically short- to medium-term (weeks to months) [^1157A2Hc].

---

### Facet joint injections and radiofrequency ablation

For facet joint injections and radiofrequency ablation, **indications** include facet-mediated pain confirmed by diagnostic blocks, and **effectiveness** is longer-term with radiofrequency ablation (6–12 months) [^1146zDRq].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** with significant neurologic deficits or instability [^115HV3TS].

---

### Indications for surgery

Indications for surgery include **persistent pain** despite comprehensive conservative care and progressive or severe neurologic deficits. Imaging-confirmed spinal instability also warrants operative consideration [^112AXDTx].

---

### Surgical options

Surgical options include **decompression** alone for predominant leg symptoms without instability [^114FCxJG]. Decompression with fusion is used for instability or significant back pain, while total disc replacement may be considered in selected patients with isolated disc degeneration.

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Many patients improve gradually over months with **conservative management** [^115sLCjW], whereas interventional procedures typically provide temporary relief and may require repetition. In selected patients, surgical treatment yields generally favorable outcomes with improved pain and function [^112WycZ8].

---

## Complications and risks

Complications and risks vary by treatment: conservative care carries minimal risk, though **NSAIDs** may cause gastrointestinal or renal adverse effects. Interventional procedures can result in infection, bleeding, nerve injury, or transient symptom worsening. Surgical management carries risks including infection, bleeding, nerve injury, hardware failure, and adjacent segment degeneration [^114cDxTV].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies focus on **regular exercise** with core strengthening and flexibility training, weight management to maintain a healthy body weight, and ergonomics emphasizing proper posture and body mechanics. Smoking cessation may reduce degeneration risk.

Back pain from spondylosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 is common and often chronic, typically due to **disc degeneration** and **facet arthropathy**, and may involve nerve compression. Management should start with **conservative care** — NSAIDs, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes — with imaging reserved for persistent or severe symptoms [^116Pckyd]. If conservative measures fail, consider epidural steroid injections [^112pkf5b] or radiofrequency ablation [^1146zDRq]; **surgery** (decompression with or without fusion) is reserved for refractory cases with instability or neurologic compromise [^115HV3TS].

### The kinematics and spondylosis of the lumbar spine vary depending on the levels of motion segments in individuals with low back pain [^115B6T13]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

A prospective cohort study aimed to identify associations of spondylotic and kinematic changes with low back pain (LBP). The ability to characterize and differentiate the biomechanics of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic lumbar spine is crucial to addressing the sparse literature on the association of lumbar spine biomechanics and LBP.

Lumbar dynamic plain radiographs (flexion-extension), dynamic computed tomography (CT) scanning (axial rotation, disc height), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, disc and facet degeneration grades) were obtained for each subject. These parameters were compared between symptomatic and control groups using Student t-test and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for patient age and sex to identify spinal parameters independently associated with symptomatic LBP. Disc grade and mean segmental motion by level were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Ninety-nine volunteers (64 asymptomatic/35 LBP) were prospectively recruited, with a mean age of 37.3 ± 10.1 years; 55% were male. LBP showed association with increased L5/S1 translation [odds ratio (OR) 1.63 per mm, P = 0.005], decreased flexion-extension motion at L1/L2 (OR 0.87 per degree, P = 0.036), L2/L3 (OR 0.88 per degree, P = 0.036), and L4/L5 (OR 0.87 per degree, P = 0.020), increased axial rotation at L4/L5 (OR 2.11 per degree, P = 0.032), decreased disc height at L3/L4 (OR 0.52 per mm, P = 0.008) and L4/L5 (OR 0.37 per mm, p < 0.001), and increased disc grade at all levels.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^1146zDRq]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that what may be best for an individual person and justifiable in a clinical trial may not be in the best interest of society, or even for an individual practitioner. For example, interventions that are incredibly costly and time-consuming, but provide only a marginal increase in efficacy, may not be cost-effective on a macro level. However, the conduct of early phase clinical trials does not usually reflect clinical practice. Inclusion and exclusion criteria tend to be longer and more rigorous in clinical trials, and the additional costs incurred by being more selective in enrollment and meticulous in performance often pale in comparison to the overall cost of product or drug development.

- **Patient selection**: Similar to all treatments, patient selection for diagnostic facet blocks plays a critical role in determining the likelihood of a positive outcome. There is consensus that failure of at least three months of conservative therapy is a reasonable threshold that should be implemented in both clinical trials and practice, although practice guidelines could allow flexibility in cases of extenuating circumstances. The cut-off for clinical trials is similar to what was advocated by an international panel of experts for epidural steroid injection studies, and is predicated on the observation that the natural prognosis is favorable for back pain in individuals with acute pain, even without treatment. There is scant evidence supporting specific physical examination signs or imaging to diagnose facetogenic pain or predict treatment outcomes.

### Which factors prognosticate spinal instability following lumbar laminectomy [^112oAqsa]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Lumbar laminectomy is a commonly used treatment for symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Although the impinged nerves are decompressed and neurological symptoms such as low back pain, sciatica, claudication, motor, sensory, and reflex activity often improve following lumbar laminectomy, it can lead to symptomatic postoperative lumbar instability or even postoperative failure of the spinal motion segment. A well-known complication of lumbar laminectomy is excessive shear displacement in the intervertebral joint, leading to postoperative spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Symptomatic clinical instability justifies reoperation to stabilize and fuse the unstable segment. When residual strength and shear stiffness (SS) of the lumbar spine after laminectomy can be predicted, this may support patient selection for additional spinal stabilization. In other words, based on predicted residual shear properties, the surgeon may decide whether or not to combine laminectomy with (instrumented) fusion techniques.

Previously, we showed in an in vitro experiment that laminectomy resulted in a substantial decrease of SS and shear force to failure (SFF) of lumbar spinal segments. However, the biomechanical behavior of a spinal motion segment following laminectomy will likely also depend on disc degeneration, facet joint degeneration, Modic changes, Schmorl's nodes, intervertebral disc and pedicle geometry, and facet joint angles.

To our best knowledge, there is a lack of information in the literature demonstrating correlations between these various anatomical factors.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115RBKWX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The search strategy was modeled based on the North American Spine Society: Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis, modified by information specialists and validated by clinical experts and an evidence synthesis expert. A three-step search strategy was used to identify both published and unpublished studies. A limited search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) using the keywords and index terms 'lumbar spondylolisthesis' and 'fusion'. The analysis of the text words in the titles and abstracts and the index terms used to describe articles followed.

In May 2022, an information specialist conducted a comprehensive search including MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Emcare (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Scopus. Sources of grey literature included ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and registers of clinical trials: ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (see online supplemental appendix A). The reference lists of relevant publications were screened for additional eligible studies. We did not apply time, study design, language, geographical, or other restrictions. We imported the retrieved records into Endnote V.X9.2 (Clarivate Analytics, Pennsylvania) and removed duplicates according to the method described by Bramer et al. Search strategies were downloaded or manually copied from each database or register and saved in a Microsoft Word document.

Two reviewers, LK and DT, independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the potentially eligible studies.

### Rationale in the management of 4-level lumbar spondylolyses with or without instability and/or spondylolisthesis [^111VHJaZ]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

This study is a case report with the objective to document the first instance of 4-level lumbar spondylolysis in the literature. Although there are several reported cases of 2- or 3-level spondylolysis, there are no studies on 4-level spondylolysis. Current literature does not provide management guidelines for such cases.

A 48-year-old female exhibited long-standing severe spinal instability, low back pain, and bilateral neurogenic claudication. The management strategy for this patient considered the unique clinical profile of each of the four levels, focusing on the use of a pars block to determine effective treatment options.

- **Methods**: The patient underwent treatment involving intervertebral fusions at two levels and pars repair at one level. Conservative treatment was applied to the remaining level of pars lysis, resulting in a favorable clinicoradiological outcome.

- **Conclusion**: The success in managing multiple levels of lyses depends on selecting the appropriate treatment for each level individually. The pars block is a valuable invasive procedure for identifying symptomatic levels in complex cases.

### Surgical compared with nonoperative treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis. Four-year results in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) randomized and observational cohorts [^112WycZ8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). High credibility.

The management of degenerative spondylolisthesis associated with spinal stenosis remains controversial. Surgery is widely used and has recently been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment when the results were followed over two years. Questions remain regarding the long-term effects of surgical treatment compared with those of nonoperative treatment.

- **Methods**: Surgical candidates from thirteen centers with symptoms of at least twelve weeks' duration, as well as confirmatory imaging showing degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis, were offered enrollment in a randomized cohort or observational cohort. Treatment consisted of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual nonoperative care. Primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at six weeks, three months, six months, and yearly up to four years.

- **Results**: In the randomized cohort (304 patients enrolled), 66% of those randomized to receive surgery received it by four years, whereas 54% of those randomized to receive nonoperative care received surgery by four years. In the observational cohort (303 patients enrolled), 97% of those who chose surgery received it, whereas 33% of those who chose nonoperative care eventually received surgery. The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort, which was limited by nonadherence to the assigned treatment, showed no significant differences in treatment outcomes between the operative and nonoperative groups at three or four years.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^117JqxRq]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can lead to compression of the neural and vascular elements and is becoming more common due to degenerative changes that occur because of aging processes. Symptoms may manifest as pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks. The traditional treatment algorithm for LSS consists of conservative management, including physical therapy, medication, education, exercise, often followed by epidural steroid injections (ESIs). When nonsurgical treatment has failed, open decompression surgery with or without fusion is considered. This review discusses the variables that should be considered during the management of patients with LSS and evaluates the role of each treatment option to provide optimal care.

This review leads to the creation of an evidence-based practical algorithm to aid clinicians in the management of patients with LSS. Special emphasis is directed at minimally invasive surgery, which should be considered when conservative management and ESI have failed.

### Chronic low back pain and fusion: A comparison of three surgical techniques: A prospective multicenter randomized study from the Swedish lumbar spine study group [^112zkq3G]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

A multicenter randomized study with a 2-year follow-up period and an independent observer was conducted. The objective was to compare three commonly used surgical techniques to achieve lumbar fusion, primarily in terms of their ability to reduce pain and decrease disability in patients with severe chronic low back pain.

Lumbar fusion can be used to reduce pain and decrease disability in patients with chronic low back pain, and different surgical techniques are available. The reported results after fusion surgery vary considerably, but most studies are retrospective and performed on heterogeneous patient groups. Spine surgeons commonly use the techniques presented in this report. However, in the absence of randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether any one of them is better than the others for these patients.

From 1992 through 1998, 294 patients referred to 19 spinal centers were blindly randomized into four treatment groups: three surgical groups (n = 222) and one nonsurgical group (n = 72). The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics did not differ among the groups. Eligibility included patients 25 to 65 years of age with therapy-resistant chronic low back pain that had persisted for at least 2 years and radiologic evidence of disc degeneration (spondylosis) at L4-L5, L5-S1, or both. Only patients randomized to one of three surgical groups were analyzed in the study: Group 1 (posterolateral fusion; n = 73), Group 2 (posterolateral fusion combined with variable screw placement, an internal fixation device).

### The global spine care initiative: A summary of guidelines on invasive interventions for the management of persistent and disabling spinal pain in low- and middle-income communities [^115oHuZg]. European Spine Journal (2018). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to synthesize recommendations on the use of common elective surgical and interventional procedures for individuals with persistent and disabling non-radicular/axial pain, with or without myelopathy, radicular back pain, cervical myelopathy, symptomatic spinal stenosis, and fractures due to osteoporosis. This review aimed to inform a clinical care pathway on the patient presentations where surgical interventions could reasonably be considered.

- **Methods**: We synthesized recommendations from six evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and one appropriate use criteria guidance for the surgical and interventional management of persistent and disabling spine pain.

- **Results**: Lower priority surgery/conditions include fusion for lumbar/non-radicular neck pain, while higher priority surgery/conditions include discectomy/decompressive surgery for cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Epidural steroid injections are less expensive than most surgeries with fewer harms; however, benefits are small and short-lived. Vertebroplasty should be considered over kyphoplasty as an option for patients with severe pain and disability due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

- **Conclusion**: Elective surgery and interventional procedures could be limited in medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries due to a lack of resources and surgeons, thus surgical and interventional procedures should be prioritized within these settings. There are non-invasive alternatives that produce similar outcomes.

### Surgical management of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis [^111B5bzs]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a common cause of low back pain, radiculopathy, and/or neurogenic claudication. Treatment begins with a trial of nonsurgical methods, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and epidural corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment with decompression and fusion is recommended for patients who do not respond to this initial regimen. Although much has been published in the past two decades on surgical management of DS, the optimal method remains controversial. Interbody fusion may improve arthrodesis rates and can be performed via numerous surgical approaches. Minimally invasive techniques continue to be developed. Particular attention to surgical management of DS in the elderly is warranted, given the increasing numbers of elderly persons. Future healthcare utilization must take into account evidence-based medicine that establishes clinically effective practices while also being cost-effective.

### Sagittal alignment in the degenerative lumbar spine: Surgical planning [^114ZZF4D]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

A 73-year-old patient presented with progressive low back pain, unresponsive to conservative measures, and bilateral lower-extremity radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed moderate central and neuroforaminal stenosis bilaterally at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. The preoperative patient-reported outcome measures were an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of 40, EuroQol Index Score (estimated health utility) of 0.60, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Mental Health (GMH) of 50.80 and Global Physical Health (GPH) of 37.40, and Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), determined from the Exercise Vital Sign (EVS), of 90.00.

Obtaining imaging that captures the entire spine and the lower extremities is preferred to assess any compensatory changes that have occurred. Lumbar and full-body lateral free-standing radiographs revealed L4-L5 and L5-S1 grade-2 spondylolisthesis, dynamic in nature when compared between flexion and extension radiographs. In addition, compensatory L3-L4 lordosis and L2-L3 hyperlordosis were noted. The patient had an L1-L4 lordosis of 38.1° and an L4-S1 lordosis of 18.3°, indicating a maldistribution of lordosis. The PT was 28°, indicating compensatory pelvic retroversion.

- **Surgical planning**: Preoperative sagittal alignment, with spinopelvic parameters. CT = computed tomography (Fig. 5).

### Spinal stenosis: Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^114cDxTV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency among older individuals as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the primary goals of treatment are pain relief and improved function. However, there is little empirical evidence to support many of the commonly used interventions. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, leading to wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across different geographic regions.

Practice recommendations are often based on expert opinion that integrates available evidence into existing clinical and biological paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, pain-control medications, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment is most commonly considered for patients who do not improve with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. Fusion, with or without instrumentation, is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or when there are concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

- **Level of evidence**: Level V (expert opinion). See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### A review of emerging evidence for utilization of a percutaneous interspinous process decompression device to treat symptomatic lumbar adjacent-segment degeneration [^111BmNCX]. Pain Medicine (2019). High credibility.

With the knowledge that neurogenic claudication symptoms are a significant cause of spinal cord stimulation failure, the advent of novel percutaneous interspinous process decompression (IPD) systems has the potential to provide patients with minimally invasive treatment for adjacent segment degeneration, such as lumbar spinal stenosis. Percutaneous interspinous process spacers have been studied as salvage therapy for subjects with adjacent segment degeneration after lumbar fusion or incomplete relief from spinal cord stimulation.

All subjects in a small case series of seven individuals with postlaminectomy adjacent-segment disease reported postoperative satisfaction scores of 3 or 4 on a 0–4 scale (0 being the least satisfied and 4 the most satisfied). Patients were also able to decrease or completely wean off opioid/opiate pain medications. Additionally, a study presented at the 2019 North American Neuromodulation Society Annual Meeting followed 25 patients who underwent one- or two-level percutaneous interspinous process decompression as a rescue treatment for neurogenic claudication after spinal cord stimulator implantation.

In this case series, there was a significant decrease in average leg pain (60% improvement, P < 0.0001) and axial low back pain (58% improvement, P < 0.0001). Opioid utilization was also significantly decreased in the study group, with 17 out of 19 individuals completely tapering off opioids by the final follow-up (median = 42 days after IPD implantation).

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Part 10: Lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^112AXDTx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is a common radiographic manifestation of aging, leading to the narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain.

The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. Most studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

### Facet joint syndrome: From diagnosis to interventional management [^11765TCq]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Each spinal segment consists of an intervertebral disc and paired synovial joints, known as facet joints (FJs), forming a "three-joint complex" in which each component influences the others. Degenerative changes in one joint can affect the biomechanics of the entire complex. FJs make up the posterolateral articulation connecting the posterior arch between vertebral levels. They are paired, diarthrodial joints and the only synovial joints in the spine, featuring hyaline cartilage overlying subchondral bone, a synovial membrane, and a joint capsule. The joint space accommodates 1–2 mL.

Each joint comprises an anteriorly and laterally facing inferior articular process from the superior vertebral level and a larger, posteriorly and medially facing concave superior articular process from the inferior vertebral level. Morphological variations, such as lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, can occur within the lumbar spine. These variations, defined as either sacralization of the lowest lumbar segment or lumbarization of the most superior sacral segment, are common in the general population, with a reported prevalence of 4–30%. Morphology can range from broadened transverse processes to complete fusion, classified by Castellvi. Understanding these variations is crucial to avoid interventions at incorrect levels.

The axial morphology of the lumbar FJ from L3 to S1 has been shown to gradually assume a more coronal orientation compared to proximal lumbar levels, with a maximal transverse articular dimension.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^112dWXwY]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The recommendations, by nature, are influenced by the opinions and clinical experience of the group, which, in our case, included only academically accomplished interventional pain physicians. This was done because the questions we considered were mostly technical, rather than overarching ones such as effectiveness. It is therefore possible that including more private practitioners, non-pain physicians, and even patients may have led to different conclusions.

Our guidelines were also designed to prioritize patients' needs, but these may not be the only consideration for policy recommendations. Practices that are suboptimal from an individual patient's perspective — or even the entire population of lumbar facet joint pain sufferers — may be utilitarian from society's standpoint to prevent overuse, preserve confidence from payers and regulators, and control costs. An example of this might be requiring a cut-off threshold for designating a prognostic block as positive, rather than leaving it up to patients as to whether they achieved enough benefit to proceed with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

- **Literature gaps and areas for future research**: We chose 17 questions to address in these guidelines, but this list is by no means exhaustive. In many cases, the answers to the questions we addressed will be controversial precisely because there are gaps in the literature. Areas of controversy include all aspects of lumbar facet joint arthropathy, such as the value of history, physical examination, and imaging to select block candidates, and how to perform and interpret diagnostic injections.

### Preliminary results of a randomized, equivalence trial of fluoroscopic caudal epidural injections in managing chronic low back pain: Part 4 — spinal stenosis [^1163Goo7]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis is one of the three most common diagnoses of low back and leg symptoms, which also include disc herniation and degenerative spondylolisthesis. It is characterized by a narrowing of the spinal canal with encroachment on the neural structures by surrounding bone and soft tissue. In the United States, one of the most commonly performed interventions for managing chronic low back pain is epidural injections, including their use for spinal stenosis. However, there have not been any randomized trials, and evidence is limited regarding the effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic function-limiting low back and lower extremity pain secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis.

- **Study design**: A randomized, double-blind, equivalence trial.

- **Setting**: An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, and a private practice setting in the United States.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in providing effective and long-lasting pain relief in the management of chronic low back pain in spinal stenosis and to evaluate the differences between local anesthetic with or without steroids.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group I patients received caudal epidural injections of local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%), whereas Group II patients received caudal epidural injections with 0.5% lidocaine 9 mL mixed with 1 mL of steroid. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence through simple randomization.

### Effectiveness of lumbar segmental stabilization exercises in managing disability and pain intensity among patients with lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115qnQKq]. Spine (2024). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effectiveness of lumbar segmental stabilization exercises (LSSE) in managing spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are spinal disorders associated with lumbar segmental instability. LSSE has shown positive effects in treating these conditions; however, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are lacking.

A systematic search adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, including studies from the inception of the databases used up to January 2024, was conducted. Disability improvement and pain intensity change were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, standardized using Hedges' g. Eligible articles underwent independent scrutiny by two authors, who also performed data extraction and quality assessment. Data pooling was accomplished using a random-effects model.

In total, five randomized controlled trials comprising 198 participants were included, revealing a trend effect toward disability improvement in the LSSE group (Hedges' g = -0.598, 95% CI: -1.211 to 0.016, P = 0.056, I² = 75.447%). When the LSSE was administered as a single treatment, disability improvement became significant (Hedges' g = -1.325, 95% CI: -2.598 to -0.053, P = 0.041, I² = 80.020%). No significant effect of LSSE on pain reduction was observed (Hedges' g = -0.496, 95% CI: -1.082 to 0.090, P = 0.097, I² = 73.935%).

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^116nZz79]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Balancing access to care against maximizing success rates, a major point of contention in developing our guidelines revolved around disparities in the perceived objectives. Whereas it was charged from the outset that these guidelines should be designed to inform care in clinical practice, creating a balance between maximizing access to care for a minimally invasive procedure with a low complication rate, for which there are no reliable evidence-based treatment alternatives, and devising more stringent criteria to promote higher RFA success rates proved to be a formidable task. Formulating guidelines with liberal selection criteria aimed to minimize false-negative results, while more stringent criteria aimed to minimize false-positive results. In the end, we opted to err on the side of greater access to care, relying on education, peer-review, and regulatory bodies to limit and prevent overuse.

Overuse is not limited to facet interventions, as studies have shown significant geographic variations in spine surgery and epidural steroid injection rates, with minimal correlation between the number of procedures performed and disability rates. Overuse may be an inevitable byproduct of a fee-for-service payment system, although the incentives for high procedure utilization are multifarious. For example, a depressed, overweight patient with marital problems and sleep abnormalities, who is on disability and opioids for back pain, may be a great candidate for facet interventions because of the huge upside of the minimally invasive treatment, but from a payer's perspective, the same patient may be a poor candidate.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: Diagnosis and management [^116Pckyd]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States annually. It is a common cause of chronic insidious low back pain, especially in older patient populations with a mean age of 64 years. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition of the spine, leading to narrowing in the spaces around the neurovascular bundles and the classic symptom of low back pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities bilaterally. It is typically a progressive waxing and waning process that may deteriorate over years. The pain is typically burning or cramping, which worsens with standing and walking and improves with bending forward or sitting.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended diagnostic test because it allows cross-sectional measurement of the spinal canal. Options for nonsurgical management include physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections with and without corticosteroids, chiropractic treatment, osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications; however, few of these treatments have high-quality randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness. Surgery may be considered if nonsurgical management is ineffective.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a history of symptoms notable for pain and discomfort radiating to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks, known as neurogenic claudication. Those with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Typically, patients report symptoms of neurogenic claudication that subside with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis primarily affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. LSS is a slowly progressing condition, and a rapid onset of symptoms may indicate a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI is the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging lack high sensitivity and specificity. There is considerable variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and a lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low-cost and readily available. Radiological anteroposterior (AP) and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may reveal segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, should also be considered.

Discogenic low back pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in patients presenting to orthopaedic surgeons. In addition to surgical options, there are several nonsurgical intradiscal treatments that have gained interest, ranging from biologic, nonbiologic, cell-based, and molecular therapies. However, there is limited evidence for many of these techniques, and some are still in the clinical trial stage. We describe a broad overview of these intradiscal therapies, the mechanism of action, and the evidence behind them.

### Clinical guidelines and payer policies on fusion for the treatment of chronic low back pain [^114mHTFq]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

This systematic review aims to provide a critical appraisal of general and fusion-specific clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of chronic nonradicular low back pain. It also compares the quality and evidence base of fusion guidelines and select payer policies.

The treatment of lumbar spondylosis, associated with low back pain, using lumbar arthrodesis or fusion, has increased fourfold in the past two decades. The significant associated health care costs have led to a surge in clinical guidelines and payer policies influencing patient treatment options. Assessment of the medical necessity of treatments, such as lumbar fusions, based on medical literature, will often override the physician's determination in patient care. Concerns regarding the effectiveness and costs of surgical treatments for spinal disorders presenting with low back pain have placed enormous scrutiny on the value of surgical treatments for patients. Both clinical guidelines and payer policies significantly impact the perceived effectiveness, or medical necessity, of lumbar fusions for chronic nonradicular low back pain. Thus, a review of this topic was undertaken.

An electronic literature search of PubMed, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment was performed to identify clinical practice guidelines on the assessment and treatment of chronic nonradicular low back pain, including those on the use of lumbar fusion.

### Interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain: Evidence-based practice guidelines [^113grYmu]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54% to 80%, with as many as 60% of patients continuing to have chronic pain five years or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Available evidence documents a wide degree of variance in the definition and the practice of interventional pain management.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain, utilizing all types of evidence, applying an evidence-based approach, with broad representation of specialists from academic and clinical practices.

- **Design**: A systematic review of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions applied in managing chronic spinal pain by a policy committee. The design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, formal endorsement by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included AHRQ criteria, QUADAS criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), and Level III (moderate).

### Quantifying the effects of degeneration and other patient factors on lumbar segmental range of motion using multivariate analysis [^11193S8C]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

This study involved a retrospective review and multivariate analysis to assess lumbar spine segmental range of motion (ROM) using flexion/extension (F/E) radiographs, and to determine the relationship to clinical variables. Previous research has primarily examined the roles of age and degeneration on lumbar segmental ROM using only univariate analyses. However, multivariate analyses are essential to differentiate multiple factors affecting ROM and to quantify their relative effects.

Radiographs from 258 patients (137 females and 121 males, aged 18 to 92 years) were analyzed. The segmental ROM and Kellgren score (KS) of degeneration were assessed for L1-S1. Multivariate regression analyses were performed for each level, with the following predicting variables evaluated:

- **Kellgren score (KS)**: at the level of interest, above, and below.
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Weight**
- **Height**
- **Body mass index (BMI)**
- **Smoking**

Significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Interobserver reliabilities for assessing KS (ICC 0.70) and segmental ROM (ICC 0.80) were rated as good to excellent. The multivariate analyses revealed:

- **Age**: Significant negative association with ROM at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5.
- **BMI**: Significant negative association with ROM at L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5.
- **Kellgren score at the level of interest**: Significant negative association with ROM only at L5-S1.

KS at adjacent levels, gender, weight, height, and smoking did not exhibit a significant association with ROM at any level.

These findings highlight the quantified effects of age and BMI on lumbar ROM across different spinal segments, underscoring the complexity of factors involved in spinal degeneration.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^1132jzBj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

CT and confirmatory IA facet joint injections were evaluated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 63 patients. The patients underwent CT scans followed by a series of IA facet joint injections at the L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels. The CT scans were independently reviewed in random order by three radiologists blinded to the clinical status of the patients. Each facet joint was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 based on the extent of joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral erosions, cysts, and osteophytes. All facet joint injections were fluoroscopically guided, and the injectate consisted of up to 1.5 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%. The placebo injections consisted of 0.5 mL of normal saline. A positive IA injection was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in VAS scores maintained for a minimum of 3 hours. A positive response to placebo injections was observed in 32% (20 of 63) of patients, while 40% reported a positive response to the bupivacaine injections. No significant association was observed between radiological grading of facet joint pathology and response to IA facet joint injections.

- **Recommendations**: In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the use of SPECT for identifying painful lumbar facet joints prior to MBB (grade C recommendation, moderate level of certainty). Weak evidence exists supporting the use of SPECT for identifying painful lumbar facet joints prior to IA facet joint injections (grade D recommendation, low level of certainty). Regarding the cost-effectiveness of SPECT, further study is required. For scintigraphy, MRI, and CT, there is weak or no evidence supporting the use of these imaging modalities.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^112gZb6h]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Unlike standards, which generally come from an undisputed authority and are limited in application, guidelines tend to be more flexible, providing recommendations on areas of uncertainty. However, what may be an appropriate treatment approach for one patient may not work for another. An example might be proceeding straight to RFA without a diagnostic block in an elderly person with pronounced facet joint degeneration on imaging, who is on anticoagulants for a high-risk condition and is from out of state or country.

These guidelines should thus serve as a framework to guide care, not as immutable standards. Similar to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opioid guidelines, which have been criticized for being taken out of context by some insurance carriers and limiting access to care, payers should consider context, unique clinical considerations, and provider and patient input, rather than mandating inflexible application.

A second limitation was the high number of participants in our workgroup representing multiple countries and professional organizations, which is more than what is typically recommended to achieve consensus but was necessary to ensure the participation of multiple stakeholder organizations. This led to the creation of subcommittees for individual questions, which were sent to the entire committee after editing by the Committee Chair. The use of small subcommittees to develop recommendations can result in an inability to come up with the best answer, while the large number of participants in the main committee can lead.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^116qeD9a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, these multiorganizational facet intervention guidelines are meant to serve as a blueprint to guide care in an era characterized by increasingly polarized views, where there is often a lack of communication between parties with different opinions. These guidelines should not be misconstrued as unalterable standards, nor can they account for every possible variation in presentation or treatment circumstance. Similar to all facets of medicine, the decision about when to implement treatment, how to interpret treatment outcomes, and how best to weigh risks and benefits based on unique patient considerations should be made on an individualized basis (i.e. personalized medicine) after sufficient discussion with the patient. Evidence-based pain medicine should include consideration of the best-available research and take into account clinical experience and expertise, as well as patient values and preferences.

### Lumbar facet arthroplasty versus fusion for grade-I degenerative spondylolisthesis with stenosis: A prospective randomized controlled trial [^112rEZh9]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

Mean scores on the Oswestry Disability Index (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more disability related to back pain) are shown. Visual analog scale scores for low back pain and worst leg pain (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain in the specified anatomic region) are detailed. Each component of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ; scores range from 1 to 5 on the symptom score and from 1 to 4 on the physical and satisfaction scores, with lower numbers representing less severe symptoms related to neurogenic claudication, greater physical function, and greater satisfaction, respectively) is evaluated before and after surgery. This comparison involves patients who were randomly assigned to undergo decompression plus lumbar facet arthroplasty or decompression plus fusion, indicating significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups at specific time points.

Mean scores on the physical and mental component summary scores of the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) are presented. These were measured before and 24 months after surgery among patients who were randomly assigned to undergo decompression plus lumbar facet arthroplasty or decompression plus fusion. Again, a significant difference (p < 0.05) between groups at specific time points is noted.

No significant differences were identified between the fusion and arthroplasty groups in terms of surgical variables.

### Maintenance of tissue pluripotency by epigenetic factors acting at multiple levels [^115v2z6n]. PLoS Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The Hox gene Sex comb reduced (Scr) is typically expressed in the anterior compartment of the first leg (L1) but not in the L2 or L3 discs, where it gives rise to the sex comb — a unique morphological marker of L1 in male adults. Consistent with the appearance of ESC on adult L2 and L3, dpp > Trx induced strong ectopic Scr signals (Fig 1B). In wing discs where the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) signal is normally absent, dpp > Trx induced strong Ubx signals in the central pouch region. Thus, dpp > Trx can alter the developmental fate of these discs via selective induction of key Hox genes. However, no ectopic Scr was detected in wing discs by dpp > Trx, nor was Ubx detected in L1/L2 discs. Moreover, we did not detect ectopic Scr or Ubx signals in eye-antenna discs, indicating Trx is not capable of inducing Hox genes uniformly across these discs, which highlights unique developmental restrictions in different discs.

We also observed that not all Trx-expressing cells within the same disc can induce the relevant Hox genes. For instance, ubiquitous drivers such as actin > Trx could only induce Ubx in the wing pouch region and Scr in small regions of anterior L2/L3 discs (S1A and S1B Fig). This observation clearly demonstrates that different parts of a given disc are not equally competent for the activation of Hox genes.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: A systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11217szZ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (2019 CRD42019137266). A systematic search was conducted to synthesize data from randomised controlled trials published between 1996 and May 2023. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist to report the findings.

The eligibility criteria for inclusion of trials are presented in the following details. Our protocol stipulated an age range of 65 years or older, which we amended after noting several relevant studies involving participants with lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms aged 50 upwards from a preliminary review of the literature:

- **Eligibility criteria for inclusion of studies**: Based on previous systematic reviews, a robust search strategy was developed by an information specialist in health sciences. Electronic searches for eligible studies were conducted within databases, including the ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN trial registry websites. For all included studies, we also undertook backward and forward reference searching by hand.

After the screening of titles and abstracts by pairs of authors (CC, EW, or CC, SM) and the exclusion of duplicates, full texts were retrieved and independently assessed by two authors as mentioned. Any discrepancies in selecting the studies were resolved through discussion.

For each included trial, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2 to assess the potential for bias across five domains: randomisation, intervention assignment, missing data, outcome measurement, and reporting. We utilized signaling questions from the tool to evaluate bias comprehensively.

### Interventional techniques: Evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1149MbpT]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic spinal pain with interventional techniques were developed to provide recommendations to clinicians in the United States.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic spinal pain, utilizing all types of evidence and to apply an evidence-based approach, with broad representation by specialists from academic and clinical practices.

- **Design**: Study design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), Level III (moderate), Level IV (limited), to Level V (indeterminate).

- **Results**: Among the diagnostic interventions, the accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is strong in the diagnosis of lumbar and cervical facet joint pain, whereas it is moderate in the diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain. The evidence is strong for lumbar discography.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Part 9: Lumbar fusion for stenosis with spondylolisthesis [^111EdTWf]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with stenosis associated with a spondylolisthesis will often describe signs and symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and/or low-back pain. The primary objective of surgery, when deemed appropriate, is to decompress the neural elements. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration.

Since the publication of the original guidelines, there have been a significant number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion procedure.

There is insufficient evidence, however, to recommend a standard approach to achieve a solid arthrodesis. When formulating the most appropriate surgical strategy, it is recommended that an individualized approach be adopted, one that takes into consideration the patient's unique anatomical constraints and desires, as well as the surgeon's experience.

### Management of lumbar spinal stenosis [^115sLCjW]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) affects more than 200,000 adults in the United States, resulting in substantial pain and disability. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome characterized by pain in the buttocks or lower extremities, with or without accompanying back pain. It is associated with reduced space for the neural and vascular elements in the lumbar spine. The condition is often exacerbated by standing, walking, or lumbar extension and relieved by forward flexion, sitting, or recumbency.

Clinical care and research into lumbar spinal stenosis are complicated by the heterogeneity of the condition, the lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and inclusion in studies, and high rates of anatomic stenosis on imaging studies in older people who are completely asymptomatic. The options for non-surgical management include drugs, physiotherapy, spinal injections, lifestyle modification, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, few high-quality randomized trials have evaluated conservative management.

A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of non-surgical treatment. Several different surgical procedures are used to treat patients who do not improve with non-operative therapies. Given that rapid deterioration is rare and that symptoms often wax and wane or gradually improve, surgery is almost always elective and considered only if sufficiently bothersome symptoms persist despite trials of less invasive interventions.

### Which factors prognosticate spinal instability following lumbar laminectomy [^114kawtm]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was performed based on two separate groups. The first group contained untreated segments (5× L2–L3 and 5× L4–L5) while the second group consisted of segments with laminectomy (5× L2–L3 and 5× L4–L5).

Independent variables were classified as general variables, intervertebral disc geometry (MRI), pedicle geometry (MRI), facet joint orientation (MRI), bone characteristics (DXA), intervertebral disc degeneration classifications (MRI), intervertebral disc and facet joint degeneration (radiographs), facet joint degeneration (MRI), and others (MRI). These classes of variables are specified in Table 2.

- **Overview of correlations**: (p values, two-tailed < 0.05: in bold) between independent and dependent variables in untreated and treated segments.

- For DVs, t values are presented, while correlations based on CVs and OVs are described by Pearson's coefficient of correlation.
- SS shear stiffness, SYF shear yield force, SFF shear force to failure, DV dichotomized variable, CV continuous variable, OV ordinal variable.

Relations between independent and dependent variables (SS, SYF, and SFF) were tested for each individual variable. For dichotomized independent variables (segment, sex, Modic changes, and Schmorl's nodes), independent-sample t-tests were used, while Pearson's coefficient of correlation was determined for continuous and ordinal values. Note that it was thus assumed that ordinal variables (Pfirrmann, Griffith, Lane 1, Lane 2, Wilke, Pathria, and Weishaupt) represent a linear degree of severity.

### Are "structural abnormalities" on magnetic resonance imaging a contraindication to the successful conservative treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain [^116PJBov]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

This prospective study examines the association between structural abnormalities recorded on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outcomes after evidence-based conservative treatment in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP).

In most guidelines for the management of LBP, MRI is not recommended unless the diagnostic triage suggests serious spinal pathology or nerve root involvement for which surgical treatment is foreseen. This is because many structural changes seen on MRI appear to be as common in asymptomatic individuals as in people with LBP. Consequently, such changes are considered of little value in explaining the cause of pain or deciding the subsequent course of management. However, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed whether the presence of such MRI abnormalities influences the outcome of the conservative treatment typically received by patients with chronic nonspecific LBP.

T2-weighted, 4-mm spin-echo MRI sequences of the lumbar spine were obtained from 53 patients with chronic nonspecific LBP before a 3-month program of exercise therapy. Disc degeneration, disc bulging, high-intensity zones, and endplate/bone marrow changes were assessed for each lumbar segment. Back pain (average and worst) and disability (Roland Morris score) were assessed before and after therapy and 12 months later. The improvements were examined in relation to the presence or absence of baseline MRI "abnormalities".

Results revealed that eighty-nine percent of patients had severe disc degeneration (grade 4 or 5), and 74% had additional changes, though the text ends abruptly here.

### Coexisting lumbar spondylosis in patients undergoing TKA: How common and how serious [^1112yRF8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Information on the coexistence of lumbar spondylosis and its influence on overall levels of pain and function in patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) would be valuable for patient consultation and management.

- **Questions/purposes**: The purposes of this study were to document the prevalence and severity of coexisting lumbar spondylosis in patients with advanced knee OA undergoing TKA and to determine whether the coexisting lumbar spondylosis at the time of TKA adversely affects clinical scores in affected patients before and 2 years after TKA.

- **Methods**: Radiographic lumbar spine degeneration and lumbar spine symptoms, including lower back pain, radiating pain at rest, and radiating pain with activity, were assessed in 225 patients undergoing TKA. In addition, the WOMAC score and the SF-36 scores were evaluated before and 2 years after TKA. Potential associations of radiographic lumbar spine degeneration and lumbar spine symptom severities with pre- and postoperative WOMAC subscales and SF-36 scores were examined.

- **Results**: All 225 patients had radiographic degeneration of the lumbar spine, and the large majority (89% [200 of 225]) had either moderate or severe spondylosis (72% and 17%, respectively). A total of 114 patients (51%) had at least one moderate or severe lumbar spine symptom. No association was found between radiographic severity of lumbar spine degeneration and pre- and postoperative clinical scores. In terms of lumbar spine symptoms, more severe symptoms were likely to adversely affect the preoperative scores.

### Can patients with sagittally well-compensated lumbar degenerative kyphosis benefit from surgical treatment for intractable back pain [^115PvWJ6]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

To analyze pre- and postoperative x-rays of sagittal spines and to review the surgical results of 21 patients with lumbar degenerative kyphosis whose spines were sagittally well compensated by compensatory mechanisms but who continued to suffer from intractable back pain, we performed a retrospective review of 21 patients treated with combined anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis.

- **Methods**: Inclusion criteria were lumbar degenerative kyphosis patients with intractable back pain and whose spines were sagittally well compensated by a compensatory mechanism, defined as a C7 plumb line to the posterior aspect of the L5-S1 disc of less than 5 cm. Outcome variables included radiographic measures of preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up films; clinical assessment using the mean Numeric Rating Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Patient Satisfaction Index; and a review of postoperative complications.

- **Results**: All patients were female (mean age, 64.5 years; age range, 50–74 years). The mean preoperative sagittal imbalance was 19.5 (± 17.6) mm, which improved to -15.8 (± 22.2) mm after surgery. Mean lumbar lordosis was 13.2 degrees (± 15.3) before surgery and increased to 38.1 degrees (± 14.4) at follow-up (P < 0.0001). Mean thoracic kyphosis was 5.5 degrees (± 10.2) before surgery and increased to 18.9 degrees (± 12.4) at follow-up (P < 0.0001). Mean sacral slopes were 12.9 degrees (± 11.1) before surgery and increased to 26.3 degrees (± 9.6) at follow-up (P < 0.0001). The mean Numeric Rating Scale score improved from 7.8 (back pain) and 8.1.
