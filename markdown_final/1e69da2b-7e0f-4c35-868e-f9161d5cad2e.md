## Question

Pleuritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage pleuritis/pleuritic chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and immediate exclusion of life-threatening causes. Then, I should confirm the baseline diagnostic workup and imaging. Next, I will consider pleural effusion characterization and targeted diagnostic pathways for PE, TB, parapneumonic/empyema, and malignant effusions. After that, I should outline management principles by etiology, including analgesia. Finally, I will address follow-up, special populations, and important caveats to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical problem and prioritization of threats. Pleuritic chest pain is classically sharp, worse with inspiration/expiration, and PE is the most common life-threatening etiology that must be considered early alongside MI, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and pneumonia, so I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on benign pleurisy without excluding these conditions first [^113G3N6G] [^111SJ6BL] [^111orLUA].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate workup sequence so I do not miss time-sensitive diagnoses. All patients should have a focused history and exam, vitals including pulse oximetry, a chest radiograph, and an ECG, with troponin or further testing guided by suspicion for MI or pericarditis, and with validated decision rules guiding PE testing to avoid unnecessary imaging while not missing high-risk disease [^111SJ6BL] [^116wb9HA] [^113G3N6G].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach if the chest X-ray reveals a pleural effusion. If an effusion is present, diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance is indicated to classify the fluid and steer the differential, and I need to ensure pleural fluid studies include Light's criteria, pH, glucose, LDH, cell count with differential, Gram stain/culture, and cytology, with meticulous technique for pH sampling to avoid heparin or air contamination per BTS 2023 [^115xuVJx] [^111mD8Dn] [^113cFdH7].

> Let me think about interpretation before I jump ahead. Exudates most often reflect pneumonia, cancer, TB, or PE, whereas transudates point to systemic drivers such as heart failure or cirrhosis, but I should double-check for mixed etiologies since up to 30% of effusions can have more than one cause, and use clinical context or biomarkers like BNP if heart failure may be contributory; I initially thought "effusion equals thoracentesis in all cases", but wait, I should clarify that small, clearly transudative, stable effusions in decompensated heart failure may be observed with diuresis when the diagnosis is certain and there are no atypical features, though any diagnostic uncertainty warrants sampling [^111mD8Dn] [^115qgTr2] [^115xuVJx].

> Next, I should review the PE pathway carefully without skipping steps. I almost said to go straight to CT angiography when suspicion is high, but hold on, I should verify that we first apply a validated decision rule such as Wells or Geneva to stratify risk, then use D-dimer for low-probability patients and CTA or V/Q scanning for high probability or positive D-dimer, with ECG and troponin aiding in risk assessment and exclusion of cardiac causes [^113G3N6G] [^112kotWt] [^112AZwRf].

> Now, let me examine suspected tuberculous pleurisy, especially in endemic settings or compatible clinical pictures. ADA and interferon-gamma in pleural fluid are useful adjuncts with high pooled sensitivity and specificity, but I need to remember that TB effusions are not uniformly lymphocytic and can be neutrophil-predominant early or when culture-positive; liquid media culture increases yield substantially and combining pleural effusion and sputum cultures can reach yields comparable to biopsy, while thoracoscopy maximizes histologic sensitivity when fluid studies are inconclusive or malignancy must be excluded; I should also consider non-tuberculous mycobacterial pleurisy, sometimes presenting with pneumothorax, to avoid misclassification when ADA is high [^113feU5b] [^113dwJ6k] [^111WZm24] [^113K5SZW] [^112kqbx3] [^1158arWt] [^114rytof] [^113CBJak].

> I will now examine parapneumonic effusion and empyema because pleural sepsis carries morbidity if drainage is delayed. Complicated parapneumonic effusions typically have low pH, low glucose, and high LDH, and pleural pH less than 7.2 generally mandates drainage per AATS, but wait, I should verify that low pH mimics such as rheumatoid effusion and advanced malignancy can confound pH-based decisions, so I must integrate clinical and imaging data; culture may miss anaerobes, and 16S rDNA sequencing demonstrates a higher burden of anaerobes than standard culture detects, which influences antibiotic selection and the need for drainage or intrapleural therapy in loculated cases [^1156sYdJ] [^111czL7z] [^115K91Y3] [^112M3pVH].

> Let me consider malignant effusion and mesothelial disease with a structured approach. Initial pleural fluid cytology has modest sensitivity and negative cytology does not exclude malignancy, so pleural biopsy, particularly via thoracoscopy, increases diagnostic yield; cross-sectional imaging and sometimes PET help characterize pleural thickening and nodularity, and when mesothelioma is suspected I need to confirm with histology plus immunohistochemistry and, when relevant, BAP1 loss or CDKN2A deletion for mesothelioma in situ; for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion, first-line definitive palliation can be indwelling pleural catheter or chemical pleurodesis depending on lung expandability and patient preferences [^114XqEt3] [^112BM4t9] [^115UEX4z] [^111E5kaS] [^113XpJqY] [^113iTf5L] [^1152cwcA].

> I need to address symptom control while etiology is being defined. NSAIDs are first-line for pleuritic pain in viral or nonspecific pleurisy, while opioids can be used cautiously if NSAIDs are contraindicated; but wait, let me consider inflammatory pleuritides such as lupus or rheumatoid disease where disease-directed immunomodulation may be necessary, and I should remember rare lipid-rich pseudochylothorax in chronic rheumatoid pleurisy that can be mistaken for chylothorax, prompting tailored evaluation and management [^116yLNyX] [^114Xc5rE] [^112YsJBo].

> For confirmed tuberculous pleurisy, I should confirm standard antituberculous therapy and then cautiously consider adjunctive steroids. I almost concluded steroids are definitively beneficial, but hold on, I should verify the Cochrane data show mixed and low-certainty evidence for faster symptom resolution without clear, consistent long-term benefits, so risks like hyperglycemia and infection must be weighed individually; drainage may shorten dyspnea duration but did not reduce residual pleural thickening or improve long-term function in a randomized study [^111ohccA] [^112Lti5C] [^114iBiE2] [^116Hnz3j] [^116sW2kp].

> For parapneumonic effusion and empyema, I should double-check that timely antibiotics with anaerobic coverage and source control via tube thoracostomy are central, with intrapleural fibrinolytics reserved for selected loculated infections and surgical escalation via VATS or decortication when medical therapy fails or in organized empyema; I need to ensure drainage decisions are guided by pH, biochemistry, imaging, and clinical course rather than any single parameter in isolation [^1156sYdJ] [^113bTkT1] [^112R7ZP1] [^115K91Y3].

> Next, I should review what to do when thoracoscopy yields nonspecific pleurisy. Let me be cautious here because up to about 15% later declare malignancy, particularly when effusions recur or pleural nodules/plaques were seen, so I should recommend at least a year of close follow-up with a low threshold to re-investigate if red flags appear, acknowledging that some benign conditions will also surface over time [^113aGaNX] [^115DdY6L] [^114qbaiV].

> But wait, what if more than one cause is contributing to the effusion. I need to ensure I reassess for dual pathologies because about 30% of effusions may have multiple etiologies, and serial evaluation or biomarkers like pro-BNP can help detect heart failure overlapping with exudative processes such as infection or malignancy, preventing premature closure on a single diagnosis [^115qgTr2] [^112c9s79].

> I should not forget pediatric considerations. In children, parapneumonic effusions predominate, and early recognition with appropriate antibiotics, drainage when indicated, and consideration of fibrinolytics reduce morbidity, with generally excellent long-term lung function outcomes when managed promptly, so I need to avoid delays to source control in the setting of loculation or clinical deterioration [^112fCH8V] [^112KgXUZ].

> Lastly, let me verify imaging adjuncts and uncommon mimics so I do not miss atypical causes of pleuritic pain. While chest radiography and CT are the mainstays and ultrasound guides safe sampling, MRI and FDG-PET/CT can refine pleural characterization in selected cases, contrast-enhanced sonography may help distinguish pleuropneumonia patterns in focal pleural lesions, and I should remember that cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can rarely present with pleuritic chest pain unresponsive to antibiotics and responsive to corticosteroids, preventing mislabeling as refractory pneumonia [^115UEX4z] [^1122xqfj] [^111D7gA9].

Pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura, most often due to infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy [^114XqEt3], and it typically presents with **sharp pleuritic chest pain** [^113G3N6G] and a **pleural friction rub** [^111SJ6BL]. Diagnosis is based on **history, exam, and imaging** (CXR, CT, ultrasound) [^111orLUA] [^115UEX4z], with **pleural fluid analysis** (Light's criteria, ADA, IFN-γ) [^111mD8Dn] [^113feU5b] [^113dwJ6k] and biopsy when indicated [^113XpJqY]. Management targets the underlying cause [^111SJ6BL] (antibiotics, anti-TB therapy, immunosuppression, oncology care) while providing NSAIDs for pain [^116yLNyX] and drainage for large or complicated effusions [^1156sYdJ] [^1152cwcA]; prognosis depends on etiology and timeliness of treatment [^114XqEt3].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Pleurisy has diverse causes; the most common are **infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy** [^111SJ6BL]:

- **Infectious causes**: Pneumonia [^115K91Y3], tuberculosis [^112kqbx3], viral infections (e.g. influenza, RSV, coxsackievirus) [^113G3N6G], and non-tuberculous mycobacteria [^114rytof].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^114Xc5rE], rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue diseases [^113P2W5f].
- **Malignancy**: Lung cancer [^114XqEt3], breast cancer, lymphoma, and mesothelioma [^113XpJqY].
- **Other causes**: Pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, trauma, and certain medications [^113G3N6G].

Risk factors include chronic lung disease, **immunosuppression** [^113G3N6G], smoking [^114XqEt3], and occupational exposures (e.g. **asbestos**) [^113XpJqY].

---

## Clinical presentation

Pleurisy typically presents with **sharp, stabbing chest pain** that worsens with inspiration, coughing, or movement [^113G3N6G]. A **pleural friction rub** may be heard on auscultation [^111SJ6BL]. Dyspnea and cough are common, and fever and malaise are typical in infectious causes [^115K91Y3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential for identifying the cause and guiding management:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify life-threatening causes (e.g. pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, pneumothorax) [^112kotWt] [^111orLUA].
- **Imaging**: Chest radiography [^116wb9HA], CT, and ultrasound to detect effusions or pleural abnormalities [^115UEX4z].
- **Pleural fluid analysis**: Light's criteria to differentiate exudates from transudates [^111mD8Dn]; ADA and IFN-γ for tuberculous pleurisy [^113feU5b] [^113dwJ6k].
- **Biopsy**: Thoracoscopic or image-guided biopsy for malignancy or unclear cases [^113XpJqY].

---

## Management strategies

Treatment targets the **underlying cause** while **relieving symptoms**:

- **Infectious pleurisy**: Antibiotics for bacterial infections [^115K91Y3]; anti-tuberculous therapy for TB [^112AdCAt]; antivirals for viral infections.
- **Autoimmune pleurisy**: Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, methotrexate) [^114Xc5rE].
- **Malignant pleurisy**: Oncology care, pleural drainage, pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheters [^1152cwcA] [^114XqEt3].
- **Symptomatic relief**: NSAIDs for pain [^116yLNyX]; thoracentesis or chest tube drainage for large or complicated effusions [^1156sYdJ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the cause and the **timeliness of treatment** [^114XqEt3]. Viral or idiopathic pleurisy often resolves with supportive care, whereas malignant pleurisy and complicated infections (e.g. empyema) carry higher morbidity and mortality [^1156sYdJ]. Complications include pleural effusion, empyema, pleural fibrosis [^116Z5Q9z], and respiratory failure.

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on risk-factor reduction and early intervention. Key measures include **vaccination** with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines [^113G3N6G], **smoking cessation** to reduce respiratory infections and malignancy risk [^114XqEt3], and adherence to **occupational safety** to avoid asbestos and other hazardous exposures [^113XpJqY]. Prompt treatment of respiratory infections and chronic diseases also helps prevent pleurisy [^111SJ6BL].

---

Pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura with varied causes; a structured diagnostic approach and cause-specific therapy are key to good outcomes, and **early recognition and targeted treatment** improve prognosis.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^111orLUA]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly in evaluating non-cardiac causes such as pleuritic chest pain, the AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a thorough history and conducting a physical examination to diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of pleuritic chest pain.

---

### Pleurisy [^111SJ6BL]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is a common presenting symptom and has many causes, which range from life-threatening to benign, self-limited conditions. Pulmonary embolism is the most common potentially life-threatening cause, found in 5 to 20 percent of patients who present to the emergency department with pleuritic pain. Other clinically significant conditions that may cause pleuritic pain include pericarditis, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and pneumothorax. Patients should be evaluated appropriately for these conditions before an alternative diagnosis is made.

History, physical examination, and chest radiography are recommended for all patients with pleuritic chest pain. Electrocardiography is helpful, especially if there is clinical suspicion of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pericarditis. When these other significant causes of pleuritic pain have been excluded, the diagnosis of pleurisy can be made. There are numerous causes of pleurisy, with viral pleurisy among the most common. Other etiologies may be evaluated through additional diagnostic testing in selected patients. Treatment of pleurisy typically consists of pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as specific treatments targeted at the underlying cause.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography.

Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain: Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens.

Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

### Diagnostic value of interferon-gamma in tuberculous pleurisy: A metaanalysis [^113dwJ6k]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Conventional tests are not always helpful in making a diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. Many studies have investigated the usefulness of interferon (IFN)-gamma measurements in pleural fluid for the early diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. We conducted a metaanalysis to determine the accuracy of IFN-gamma measurements in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy.

- **Methods**: After a systematic review of English-language studies, sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy of IFN-gamma concentrations in the diagnosis of pleural effusion were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance.

- **Results**: Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates for IFN-gamma in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy in the studies included were as follows: sensitivity, 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 0.91); specificity, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98); positive likelihood ratio, 23.45 (95% CI, 17.31 to 31.78); negative likelihood ratio, 0.11 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.16); and diagnostic odds ratio, 272.7 (95% CI, 147.5 to 504.2).

- **Conclusions**: IFN-gamma determination is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. The measurement of IFN-gamma levels in pleural effusions is thus likely to be a useful tool for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. The results of IFN-gamma assays should be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings and the results of conventional tests.

### Diagnostic accuracy of adenosine deaminase in tuberculous pleurisy: a meta-analysis [^113feU5b]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Conventional tests are not always helpful in making a diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. Many studies have investigated the usefulness of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in pleural fluid for the early diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the accuracy of ADA measurements in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy.

- **Methods**: After a systematic review of English language studies, sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy of ADA concentration in the diagnosis of pleural effusion were pooled using random effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance.

- **Results**: Sixty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates for ADA in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy in the studies included were sensitivity 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.90–0.93), specificity 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.89–0.91), positive likelihood ratio 9.03 (95% confidence interval 7.19–11.35), negative likelihood ratio 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.07–0.14), and diagnostic odds ratio 110.08 (95% confidence interval 69.96–173.20).

- **Conclusions**: ADA determination is a relatively sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. Measurement of ADA in pleural effusion is thus likely to be a useful diagnostic tool for tuberculous pleurisy. The results of ADA assays should be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings and the results of conventional tests.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS/STS/STR clinical practice guideline [^1152cwcA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, particularly in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines recommend considering either indwelling pleural catheter placement or chemical pleurodesis as the first-line definitive intervention for managing dyspnea. This applies to patients with malignant pleural effusion who have a known or likely expandable lung and no prior definitive therapy, provided that the patient's symptoms are attributed to the effusion.

---

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^111WZm24]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy is traditionally indicated by extreme lymphocytosis in pleural fluid and a low yield of effusion culture. However, there is considerable inconsistency among previous study results, and these data should be updated due to early effusion studies and advances in culture methods.

- **Methods**: From January 2004 to June 2009, patients with tuberculous pleurisy were retrospectively identified from the mycobacteriology laboratories and the pathology and tuberculosis registration databases of two hospitals in Taiwan where tuberculosis is endemic. Pleural fluid characteristics and yields of mycobacterial cultures using liquid media were evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 382 patients with tuberculous pleurisy were identified. The median lymphocyte percentage of total cells in pleural fluids was 84% (IQR 64–95%), and 17% of cases had a lymphocyte percentage of less than 50%. The lymphocyte percentage was negatively associated with the probability of a positive effusion culture (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99). The diagnostic yields were 63% for effusion culture, 48% for sputum culture, 79% for the combination of effusion and sputum cultures, and 74% for histological examination of pleural biopsy specimens.

- **Conclusion**: The degree of lymphocyte predominance in tuberculous pleurisy was lower than previously thought. The lymphocyte percentage in pleural fluid was negatively associated with the probability of a positive effusion culture. With the implementation of a liquid culture method, the sensitivity of effusion culture was much higher than previously reported.

### Evaluation and management of pleural sepsis [^115K91Y3]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pleural sepsis stems from an infection within the pleural space, typically originating from underlying bacterial pneumonia, leading to the development of a parapneumonic effusion. This effusion is traditionally divided into uncomplicated, complicated, and empyema categories. Poor clinical outcomes and increased mortality can be associated with the development of parapneumonic effusions, reinforcing the importance of early recognition and diagnosis. Management necessitates a multimodal therapeutic strategy consisting of antimicrobials, catheter/tube thoracostomy, and, at times, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

---

### Management of parapneumonic pleural effusion [^113bTkT1]. Current opinion in pulmonary medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Parapneumonic pleural effusion is a common and potentially serious complication of pneumonia. The management involves early diagnosis, adequate empiric antibiotic coverage, and appropriate risk categorization. High-risk patients require safe and expedient drainage of the infected pleural space. The management options include thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, adjunctive intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, and surgical drainage. Surgical drainage methods include thoracoscopy, thoracotomy, and decortication.

The relative clinical efficacy of these treatment options has been studied in a small number of controlled clinical trials, the results of which have been systematically reviewed by expert panels. Based on the limited clinical evidence available, expert reviewers were unable to recommend a best method of pleural drainage. However, the consensus is that an aggressive approach with early surgical drainage results in shorter hospital stays and may be more cost-effective than conservative management. This review discusses the clinical evidence and describes an aggressive sequential management strategy that combines intrapleural fibrinolysis with early surgical drainage.

### An update of the long-term outcome of patients with nonspecific pleurisy at medical thoracoscopy [^115DdY6L]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In respiratory medicine, pleural effusions are among the most complicated conditions to diagnose. Medical thoracoscopy (MT) is a minimally invasive method for diagnosing unidentified pleural effusions, with a high sensitivity rate of 85–100%. However, not all patients undergoing MT receive a definitive diagnosis. Nonspecific histopathology results can suggest the occurrence of a sampling error or genuine benign pleural disease. In our study, a clear etiological diagnosis was made in 56.5% (87/154) of undiagnosed cases after follow-up, including 19 patients who were eventually diagnosed with pleural malignancy.

Benign diseases continued to be the most common diagnosis during follow-up (68/87 patients; 78.2%). However, the atypical nature of pathology ensures that benign diseases are not easily detected by MT specificity. Even in the case of tuberculous pleurisy, the reaction occurring in the pleura may cause effusion in the absence of granulomatous inflammation. Thus, the diagnosis of benign disease depends upon the patient's clinical manifestation and the doctor's empirical treatment.

### Immunological mechanisms in pleural disease [^116Z5Q9z]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The pleural membrane, consisting of pleural mesothelial cells and its underlying connective tissue layers, plays a critical role in immunological responses in both local and systemic diseases. Due to its close proximity to the lung, the pleura is well-positioned to respond to inflammatory changes in the lung parenchyma. Several systemic diseases have a predilection for expression on the pleural surface. Immunological responses in the pleura include the development of pleural permeability and pleural effusion formation, as well as pleural fibrosis and scarring. Under these circumstances, the normal functioning of the pleura is impaired, leading to increased morbidity and even mortality for the patient.

During infections in the pleural space, the pleural mesothelium responds by actively recruiting inflammatory phagocytic cells and allowing the movement of proteins from the vascular compartment into the pleural space. The release of chemokines by the pleural mesothelium directs the migration of phagocytic cells from the basilar surface of the pleura towards the apical surface.

In malignant disease, the pleura may be the site of primary tumors such as mesothelioma and also the site for malignant metastatic deposits. Certain cancers, such as those of the breast, ovary, lung, and stomach, have a predilection for the pleural mesothelium. This review elucidates the process whereby malignant cells attach to the pleural mesothelium and develop autocrine mechanisms for survival in the pleural space.

### Characteristics of pleural effusion with a high adenosine deaminase level: a case-control study [^113Ld8xq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Previous reports have identified predictive factors for distinguishing between tuberculous pleurisy and other diseases, irrespective of ADA levels. The pleural fluid LDH/ADA ratio is useful for diagnosing pleural infection and malignant pleural effusion. Pleural amylase is significant for diagnosing malignant pleural effusion, while the pleural fluid ADA/TP ratio is relevant for IgG4-RD, and serum LDH is important for ML. These markers are similar to our results. Pleural fluid amylase levels assist in diagnosing pancreatic diseases and esophageal rupture; however, 10% of malignant pleural effusions also exhibit high pleural fluid amylase levels. Although pancreatic diseases or esophageal rupture are rare, no patients in our study presented with these conditions.

The sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology for malignant pleural effusion is reported to be 46%. Thus, elevated pleural fluid amylase levels may warrant further cytological or histopathological investigations. A predominance of neutrophils in pleural fluid typically suggests pleural infection, though 4.5–17% of tuberculous pleurisy cases display neutrophil predominance despite an usual lymphocytic predominance. In our study, 63 patients without pleural infection (13.8%) exhibited neutrophil predominance or cell degeneration in pleural fluid. The diagnosis of pleural infection should not rely solely on neutrophil predominance or cell degeneration.

Furthermore, our study found that many patients with autoimmune diseases showed eosinophil elevation in their pleural effusions. Eosinophilic pleural effusion, defined by these elevated levels, suggests that autoimmune conditions could influence pleural fluid composition and demand comprehensive diagnostic approaches.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^111mD8Dn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria.

If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### Pseudochylothorax without pleural thickening: Time to reconsider pathogenesis [^112YsJBo]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pseudochylothorax, also known as cholesterol pleurisy or chyliform effusion, is a cholesterol-rich pleural effusion commonly associated with chronic inflammatory disorders such as tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Until now, there were only 15 published cases of arthritis-associated pseudochylothorax in the English language literature. Previous literature has suggested that pleural fluid cholesterol enrichment occurs in the context of grossly thickened (fibrotic) pleura over a prolonged period, usually greater than five years. We present six well-characterized cases of arthritis-associated pseudochylothorax, each notable due to their minimal pleural thickening. The median duration of symptoms (or arthritis, in the case of asymptomatic effusions) was 15 months. Such findings cast significant doubt on the conventional concepts of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid-associated pseudochylothorax. Clinicians should consider pseudochylothorax even in short-duration nonfibrotic pleural effusions.

### New directions in the treatment of infected pleural effusion [^112R7ZP1]. Clinical Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The optimum management of patients with parapneumonic effusion and empyema remains uncertain. This article reviews the evidence and opinion on the pathophysiology of this disease, the role of fibrinolytic therapy, and the use of modern surgical techniques.

### Pigtail drainage in the treatment of tuberculous pleural effusions: A randomised study [^116sW2kp]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy can result in obvious clinical symptoms, pleural fibrosis, and pleural thickening. Some studies of tuberculous pleurisy have suggested that symptomatic improvement and minimisation of sequelae can be achieved by completely draining the effusion during treatment, although the results have not been conclusive.

- **Methods**: Sixty-one patients with tuberculous pleurisy were divided into two groups; 30 patients received pigtail drainage combined with antituberculosis (TB) drug treatment, and 31 received only anti-TB drugs. Outcome measurements were assessed for a period of 24 weeks after treatment and included symptom scores and the incidence of residual pleural thickening (RPT).

- **Results**: Although the duration of dyspnoea was significantly shortened by the use of pigtail drainage (median 4 days (IQR 4–5) vs. 8 days (IQR 7–16), p < 0.001), a comparison of combined mean (SD) visual analogue scale (VAS) scores showed no significant difference between the groups after one week of treatment (57.1 (33.2) vs. 68.5 (44.7)) or at any time during the follow-up period. The incidence of RPT of more than 10 mm in the group treated with pigtail drainage and anti-TB drugs was 26% compared with 28% in the group receiving drug treatment only. The incidence of RPT levels of more than 2 mm in the two groups was 50% and 51%, respectively. No statistical difference between the two groups in terms of forced vital capacity was found at the end of treatment (median (IQR) 85.5% (69–94) of predicted vs. 88% (78–96) of predicted).

### Recent advances in parapneumonic effusion and empyema [^115YoTWm]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema continue to account for significant morbidity and mortality, and uncertainties remain regarding their optimal management. This review describes recent advances in this field, as well as areas for future research.

- **Recent findings**: Recent advances have addressed the pathogenesis, bacteriology, and treatment of pleural infection. Key areas for research in the development of empyema include the interplay between inflammatory and coagulation cascades and the development of fibrosis within the pleural space. The varied bacteriology of empyema has been more clearly defined, and in particular, the differences between community- and hospital-acquired infections have been highlighted. Studies of treatment have focused particularly on the roles of intrapleural fibrinolytics and surgery.

- **Summary**: Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of empyema may ultimately yield novel therapeutic targets. Comprehensive descriptions of the bacteriology of empyema aid antibiotic choice, and the use of intrapleural DNase shows promise in facilitating the drainage of infected pleural fluid. Uncertainties remain, such as the role of intrapleural fibrinolytics and the optimal timing of surgical intervention.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^111ohccA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Follow-up varied from six months to 24 months; however, two trials, Bang 1997 and Lee 1999, did not clearly state the length of follow-up. None of the included trials reported all the outcome measures chosen for this review.

Five trials reported on the resolution or improvement of clinical symptoms in some way. Bang 1997 and Wyser 1996 both used self-reported questionnaires to assess the time until symptom improvement and resolution in all participants; Wyser 1996 asked participants to grade the severity of a range of symptoms on a visual analogue scale. Lee 1988 reported the time to resolution of symptoms, including fever, chest pain, and dyspnoea, for all participants, but did not specify how this was assessed. Elliott 2004 reported on the improvement of anorexia, weight loss, and cough, but data for other symptoms were not reported. Galarza 1995 reported on the time to resolution of fever.

Five trials reported on the time to resolution of pleural effusion (Bang 1997; Elliott 2004; Galarza 1995; Lee 1988; Lee 1999). Four trials reported the number of participants with residual pleural effusion at various time points during treatment (Bang 1997; Elliott 2004; Lee 1988; Lee 1999). Bang 1997 and Lee 1988 also reported the mean number of days to resolution of pleural effusion. Galarza 1995 reported the mean reabsorption index for all participants over time. The trial authors calculated the reabsorption index as follows: [(length of affected hemithorax)/(length of healthy hemithorax)] × 100. Wyser 1996 reported the recurrence of pleural effusion rather than the time to resolution, as all participants were included in the trial.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^111v45RW]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Our study also adds new insight to the pathogenesis of tuberculous pleurisy. The classical pathogenesis model, a rupture of subpleural caseous foci followed by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to M. tuberculosis antigens, indicates two primary features of tuberculous pleurisy, including lymphocyte predominance and a low yield of effusion culture. Some investigators have even suggested that tuberculous pleurisy is a disease caused by a hypersensitivity reaction rather than an infection of the pleura. However, this hypothesis can be challenged if effusion lymphocytosis and a low yield of effusion culture are not universally present in every case of tuberculous pleurisy. Based on the findings of our study, we propose a new concept for tuberculous pleurisy. We hypothesize that tuberculous pleurisy is a continuous spectrum of disease (illustrated by online supplementary figure 1) rather than the two distinguishing clinical phenotypes of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or true pleural infection. Tuberculous empyema represents an extreme condition, with a high percentage of neutrophils and a high mycobacterial load in pleural fluids. Previous studies have reported the presence of neutrophilic leukocytosis in tuberculous empyema and an increased neutrophil percentage in culture-positive tuberculous pleural effusions. Tuberculous parapneumonic effusion represents the common paucibacillary presentation of tuberculous pleurisy. The effusion lymphocyte percentage is negatively associated with the pleural mycobacterial burden and the likelihood of a positive effusion culture.

### Differential cytokine levels and immunoreactivities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens between tuberculous and malignant effusions [^113BPwTv]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Significant effort has been devoted to identifying immunologically important factors in tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) and malignant pleurisy (MP) to enhance the differential diagnosis of these major causes of lymphocyte-dominant pleurisy. This study evaluated the immunoreactivity and potential diagnostic utility of both host factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, and pathogen factors, including mycobacterial proteins, in pleural effusions. Effusion samples were collected from 41 patients with MP caused by lung cancer and from 81 patients with TBP.

The concentrations of nine cytokines and chemokines — interleukin (IL)-12 p40, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1 alpha, and CCL4/MIP-1 beta — and antibody responses (IgG, IgM, and IgA) against five Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens (early secreted antigenic target (ESAT)-6, 30-kDa, MTB12, 38-kDa, and a heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA)) were determined in pleural fluids using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

- **Logistic regression findings**: IFN-gamma (odds ratio: 7.178; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.258–22.817; p = 0.001), IL-12 p40 (odds ratio: 11.037; 95% CI: 3.38–36.037; p < 0.001), and IL-6 (odds ratio: 3.295; 95% CI: 1.147–9.463; p = 0.027) were statistically significant cytokines predicting tuberculous from malignant effusions.

Although IgG responses to all of the M. tuberculosis antigens tested were significantly higher in effusions from TBP (p < 0.001) compared with those from MP, the logistic regression showed IgG levels for ESAT-6 and MTB12 to be statistically significant predictors of TBP.

### An update of the long-term outcome of patients with nonspecific pleurisy at medical thoracoscopy [^114qbaiV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The end of our follow-up period was August 1, 2020, and individual patients were monitored until this deadline or their death. During the follow-up period, the following information was gathered from the patients or their relatives every month by telephone or personal interview: (1) patient demographics; (2) the onset of any new symptoms, such as cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath; (3) recurrence of pleural effusion after MT; (4) any subsequent diagnosis of the cause of pleural effusion later in the course of treatment; and (5) when and how the subsequent diagnosis was established.

- **Statistical analysis**: All analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation values or numbers with percentages. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis. The chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables, while the Student's t-test was performed to compare the mean values of two groups. All reported p values were two-sided, and effects were considered significant if p < 0.05.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^112Lti5C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Other potential sources of bias

We did not find enough trials that met the inclusion criteria for us to conduct a funnel plot to look for possible publication bias.

- **Effects of interventions**: It was not possible to combine effects in a meta-analysis for the outcome of time to resolution of clinical symptoms due to different units of measurement used in the trials and insufficient reported data. We have presented the results from the included trials in Table 6. Qualitatively, corticosteroids appear to be associated with more rapid resolution of symptoms, but we were unable to assess the relative effect of corticosteroids statistically.

### Correlation between interleukin-10 and in situ necrosis and fibrosis suggests a role for interleukin-10 in the resolution of the granulomatous response of tuberculous pleurisy patients [^117T2nkC]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

In order to identify mediators involved in immune-mediated disease regression, the pleural cytokine and histopathological profile was evaluated in tuberculous pleurisy patients with varied disease duration and clinical presentation, prior to chemotherapy. Interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in pleural fluids were shown to decrease with disease time. IL-10 was positively correlated with IFN-gamma, TNF, and necrosis area in pleural sections.

To parallel these findings with disease regression, individuals showing fever, anorexia, and progressive exudate in the pleural cavity (active disease) were compared with patients without symptoms and with a decrease in exudate volume (regressive disease). IFN-gamma and TNF levels were lower in regressive disease, as well as a reduced necrosis area in pleural sections. Our results indicate that tissue destruction and a prominent Th1 response mark the early phase of tuberculous pleurisy and suggest that down-modulation of this response, with the possible participation of IL-10, is associated with disease resolution.

### Imaging approach to disease of the pleura [^115UEX4z]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Diseases of the pleura are not only common but also have a significant impact on patients' outcomes. Early detection and treatment are essential in reducing this burden. However, many pleural entities present similarly, posing a diagnostic dilemma for radiologists that requires further critical workup. Chest radiography, CT, and image-guided thoracentesis are primarily utilized as the initial imaging techniques for the workup of pleural diseases. Additionally, MRI and FDG-PET/CT are frequently employed to investigate the root cause of pleural abnormalities. By elucidating the common imaging features of neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious pleural pathologies, clinicians can quickly and easily differentiate the various pleural diseases. This approach allows them to rapidly reach the correct diagnosis and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Marked increase of interferon-β after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination: a case of polyarthritis with pleurisy [^116WrwB8]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

As vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 progresses worldwide, it has become apparent that subjective symptoms exacerbate in approximately 10% of patients with rheumatic diseases within 2 weeks after vaccination. However, there are only a few cases of new onset of rheumatic diseases after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the serum cytokine profiles of these patients are scarcely explored.

Here, we present two cases of new-onset persistent polyarthritis after receiving the mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. One patient had bilateral pleural effusions with markedly elevated serum interferon (IFN)-β. The other patient had no effusion, and serum IFN-β was comparable with that in healthy subjects.

### Pleural fluids associated with chest infection [^112fCH8V]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Pleural effusions are commonly associated with pneumonias, and a small number of these progress to empyema. Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of pleural fluid aids clinicians in managing empyema. There is ongoing debate about the optimal treatment of empyema in children. Early recognition of the condition is important since delayed therapy may result in unnecessary morbidity.

Conventional management with high-dose parenteral antibiotics and chest tube drainage remains the mainstay of therapy. However, this treatment modality may fail if the pleural fluid becomes viscous and loculated. Therefore, a more aggressive approach is required. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy has been shown to decrease the length of hospital stay and may reduce the need for surgical intervention. The prognosis in children with parapneumonic empyema is excellent, with the vast majority retaining normal lung function at long-term follow-up.

### Pleural infection: What we need to know but don't [^114PRjSc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pleural infection remains a common and difficult problem to manage in the 21st century. Despite advances in modern healthcare, the rising incidence and mortality of empyema highlight a need for better understanding of the disease and more effective strategies in its diagnosis and treatment.

Recent studies have progressed our knowledge and understanding of the bacteriology and pathophysiology of pleural infection. However, rather than providing firm conclusions, the examination of literature provokes several unanswered questions on most aspects of the disease.

This review aims to challenge traditional concepts and approaches to clinical practice in pleural infection, intending to stimulate debate and research into potential novel future therapies.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^116wb9HA]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically concerning the evaluation of non-cardiac causes such as pleuritic chest pain, the AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a chest X-ray (CXR). This evaluation helps identify abnormalities, including pneumonia, in patients with unexplained pleuritic chest pain.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: Clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^114TrAZH]. Current opinion in pulmonary medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleuritis poses significant diagnostic challenges, given its varied clinical presentations. It is a condition requiring prompt diagnosis and effective management to prevent complications associated with delayed treatment. Diagnostic approaches often include thorough clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and laboratory tests such as pleural fluid analysis for acid-fast bacilli and pleural biopsy. Despite these efforts, diagnosing tuberculous pleuritis remains complex and often requires a combination of clinical acumen and laboratory support.

Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques have enhanced the detection rates but have also introduced new challenges. These include the need for better differentiation between tuberculous pleuritis and other pleural diseases such as malignancies or parapneumonic effusions. Continuous research and updates in clinical guidelines are essential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in tuberculous pleuritis management.

### Characteristics of pleural effusion with a high adenosine deaminase level: a case-control study [^113CBJak]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic flowchart based on predicted factors is a helpful supplement for distinguishing tuberculous pleurisy from other diseases with high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels. The diagnostic accuracy rate of the flowchart was 80.9%. However, malignant pleural effusion or non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections might be challenging to differentiate from tuberculous pleurisy. For pleural effusion due to NTM, there was no marker to distinguish it from tuberculous pleurisy other than the presence of pneumothorax. These features might be related to the fact that many patients with NTM were treated, including surgical procedures performed in our hospital. Nevertheless, many patients with NTM are diagnosed due to cavitary lesion rupture; therefore, evaluating disease progression can aid in diagnosis.

Moreover, a combination of chest CT findings and pleural fluid cytology is useful in diagnosing malignant pleural fluid or malignant lymphoma. Clinicians should be aware that patients with high ADA levels in pleural effusion might have a disease other than tuberculous pleurisy. Such cases should be considered using acid-fast bacillus testing of pleural fluid, combined pleural fluid cytology, disease progression evaluation, chest computerized tomography findings, and the diagnostic flowchart for tuberculous pleurisy.

This investigation had several limitations. It was conducted retrospectively, and the number of cases was small for autoimmune diseases, chronic tuberculous pyothorax, pneumothorax, haemothorax, benign asbestos pleural effusion, and drug-induced pleural effusion, which might affect the statistical power of the study.

### A higher significance of anaerobes: The clone library analysis of bacterial pleurisy [^112M3pVH]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

The frequencies of etiologic bacterial agents of intrapleural infections reported until now have been widely varied, largely depending on the implemented detective methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate bacterial etiologies of bacterial pleurisy using a cultivation-independent method.

- **Methods**: Pleural fluids were collected from 42 febrile patients with hemipleural effusion. The bacterial flora was analyzed by a clone library method using amplified fragments of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) with universal primers, in addition to conventional cultivation methods.

- **Results**: Forty-two specimens were obtained from 26 patients with bacterial pleurisy, seven with mycobacterial pleurisy, and nine with other pleural effusions. In the 26 bacterial cases, 16 (61.5%) showed positive results for 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, of which 11 (42.3%) were also positive by the cultivation method. In seven (43.8%) of the 16 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases, anaerobic phylotypes were predominantly detected. Anaerobic phylotypes (six of these seven cases) were not detected by the cultivation method. In nine (34.6%) of the 26 bacterial pleural cases, the results from the clone library methods were not concordant with those of the cultivation method. In seven of these nine cases, the discrepancies between the two detection methods were due to the existence of anaerobes.

- **Conclusion**: The clone library analysis using the 16S rDNA of pleural fluid showed a higher incidence of anaerobic bacteria in infectious pleurisy than previously expected and provided additional bacteria detection that was not possible through cultivation methods.

### Coordinate cytokine gene expression in vivo following induction of tuberculous pleurisy in guinea pigs [^1127WXRu]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy is a severe inflammatory response induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms that have escaped from lung granulomata into the pleural space during pulmonary infection. We have used the guinea pig model of tuberculous pleurisy to examine several aspects of the immune response to this antigen-specific inflammatory event. Pleurisy was induced by injection of heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Rv directly into the pleural space of guinea pigs previously vaccinated with M. bovis BCG.

Four animals were euthanized each day over a period of 9 days. Fluid in the pleural cavity was analyzed for transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and total interferon (IFN) protein levels. In addition, RNA was obtained from pleural cells and examined for TGF-beta 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IFN-gamma, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression by real-time PCR. Finally, pleural cells were examined for the ability to proliferate in response to concanavalin A and purified protein derivative (PPD) in vitro.

In the pleural fluid, TGF-beta 1 protein concentrations increased over the course of the inflammatory response while IFN protein levels were not significantly altered. Expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA peaked on days 3 and 4, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression peaked on day 3 and then returned to background levels. TNF-alpha mRNA expression was highest on days 2 to 4, and IL-8 mRNA levels remained elevated between days 2 and 5, peaking on day 3 before returning to background levels. PPD-induced proliferative responses were evident by day 3 and remained present throughout the study.

### Long-term outcome of patients with nonspecific pleurisy at medical thoracoscopy [^113aGaNX]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Medical thoracoscopy is an effective and safe procedure for diagnosing pleural effusions of undetermined causes. However, some patients with pleural effusions are diagnosed with nonspecific pleurisy when no specific biopsy results are found after undergoing thoracoscopic biopsy. The long-term outcome of these patients is unclear, and anxieties about undiagnosed malignancy persist.

- **Methods**: Between July 2005 and June 2014, medical thoracoscopy using the semi-rigid instrument was performed, and pleural biopsy was taken in 833 patients with pleural effusions. Fifty-two patients diagnosed with nonspecific pleurisy with available follow-up data were included in the present study, and their medical records were reviewed.

- **Results**: Fifty-two patients (31 men and 21 women) were included. The mean follow-up was 35.5 ± 40.9 months (range: 1–143 months). No specific diagnosis was established in 21 (40.4%) of the patients. Eight of 52 patients with nonspecific pleurisy (15.4%) were subsequently diagnosed with pleural malignancies. Twenty-three of 52 patients (44.2%) were diagnosed with benign diseases. The recurrence of pleural effusion during follow-up and pleural nodules or plaques found in medical thoracoscopy were associated with malignant disease.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with nonspecific pleurisy after medical thoracoscopy should be closely monitored, especially those with the recurrence of pleural effusion during follow-up, pleural nodules, or plaques found in medical thoracoscopy. One year of clinical follow-up is recommended for patients found to have nonspecific pleurisy.

### Pleural tuberculosis: A key differential diagnosis for pleural thickening, even without obvious risk factors for tuberculosis in a low incidence setting [^111yc14f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 64-year-old woman presenting with pleuritic chest pain and weight loss. She had a previous history of breast malignancy and no clear risk factors for tuberculosis (TB). Initial investigations revealed a right-sided pleural effusion and pleural thickening, suggestive of malignancy, consistent with the clinical presentation. An initial pleural biopsy showed features suggestive of a possible TB infection, though there was no growth on cultures. A repeat biopsy was negative on initial microscopy but culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also identifying isoniazid resistance. This case highlights that TB remains an important differential, even in the absence of classical risk factors, and illustrates the diagnostic challenges it poses. It also underscores the value of culture positivity in identifying drug resistance and facilitating appropriate treatment.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^1158arWt]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

- **Pleural fluid findings**: Table 2 shows the laboratory data for these patients. In general, the patients had no leukocytosis but had an elevated serum level of LDH. Protein-rich exudate was a common feature of the pleural fluid analysis. Figure 1A shows the distribution of the effusion lymphocyte percentages. A lymphocyte percentage of < 50% was observed in 17% of the patients. The effusion cell differential of the three excluded patients with TB empyema showed 93%, 92%, and 6% neutrophils. The case with 6% neutrophils had been treated with levofloxacin before thoracentesis.

Compared with the culture-negative effusions, the culture-positive effusions had a lower lymphocyte percentage (median 92% vs. 78%, p < 0.001). The probability of a positive effusion culture was negatively associated with the effusion lymphocyte percentage (Figure 1B). The multivariate logistic regression model identified four independent predictors of the effusion culture results, including cancer as an underlying disease (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.14 to 6.19) and effusion lymphocyte percentage (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99).

### Childhood pneumonia, pleurisy and lung function: a cohort study from the first to sixth decade of life [^114TtKSF]. Thorax (2020). Low credibility.

Adult spirometry following community-acquired childhood pneumonia has variably been reported as showing obstructive or non-obstructive deficits. We analyzed associations between doctor-diagnosed childhood pneumonia/pleurisy and more comprehensive lung function in a middle-aged general population cohort born in 1961.

- **Methods**: Data were from the prospective population-based Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study cohort. Analyzed lung function was from ages 7 years (prebronchodilator spirometry only, n = 7097), 45 years (postbronchodilator spirometry, carbon monoxide transfer factor, and static lung volumes, n = 1220) and 53 years (postbronchodilator spirometry and transfer factor, n = 2485). Parent-recalled histories of doctor-diagnosed childhood pneumonia and/or pleurisy were recorded at age 7. Multivariable linear and logistic regression were used.

- **Results**: At age 7, compared with no episodes, childhood pneumonia/pleurisy-ever was associated with reduced FEV₁:FVC for only those with asthma (beta-coefficient or change in z-score = -0.20 SD, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.02, p = 0.028, p interaction = 0.036). At age 45, for all participants, childhood pneumonia/pleurisy-ever was associated with a restrictive pattern: OR 3.02 (1.5 to 6.0), p = 0.002 for spirometric restriction (FVC less than the lower limit of normal plus FEV₁:FVC greater than the lower limit of normal); total lung capacity z-score -0.26 SD (95% CI -0.38 to -0.13), p < 0.001; functional residual capacity -0.16 SD (-0.34 to -0.08), p = 0.001; and residual volume -0.18 SD (-0.31 to -0.05), p = 0.008.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^113K5SZW]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy is the second most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and a common cause of pleural effusion in endemic TB areas. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy usually requires mycobacterial culture of pleural fluid, pleural biopsy, or other diagnostic tests. A high index of suspicion from a pleural fluid analysis is essential for diagnosis. However, the traditional concepts about the pleural fluid findings in tuberculous pleurisy mainly come from studies conducted decades ago that have not been validated in practice. Pleural fluid has been frequently studied owing to the popular use of ultrasound, which may modify the pleural fluid findings at disease presentation. In addition, the data from previous studies on the diagnostic yields for tuberculous pleurisy have varied widely and are not consistent. These studies have suggested the following diagnostic yields: 12–70% for effusion culture, 0–52% for sputum culture, and 50–90% for histological examination of pleural biopsy specimens. We consider that variations in the study results are related to the patient selection criteria, the small number of cases in most of the studies, and variable TB prevalence. Furthermore, advances in culture techniques have improved the yield of mycobacterial culture in this disease. Liquid culture media have been shown to have higher yields and faster results than solid media.

The objective of the present study was to provide updated information about the pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yields of mycobacterial culture and pleural biopsy.

### British Thoracic Society guideline for pleural disease [^113cFdH7]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

For diagnostic procedures concerning parapneumonic effusion and empyema, particularly regarding pleural fluid analysis, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend ensuring that pleural fluid samples for pH measurement are free from contamination by local anesthetic or heparin. This can be achieved by extruding all heparin from an arterial blood gas syringe, as contamination lowers pleural fluid pH. It is important to recognize that delays in obtaining a pleural fluid pH or the presence of residual air in the sampling syringe will result in an increased pleural fluid pH.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of pleural effusions with more than one aetiology. Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have multiple underlying causes.

Recent findings from a prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant diseases, the incidence of complex pleural patients is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, has been suggested as a tool for identifying contributing disease processes.

Understanding that there are potentially multiple causes for pleural effusions is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with an increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify complex pleural effusions. Further studies on whether targeting separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^111Y1SgS]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

This study reveals several important findings regarding the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. The diagnostic yield of effusion culture using liquid culture media was 63% in this study cohort, which is much higher than the yield of less than 35% reported in most of the previous studies. The combination of the effusion and sputum cultures contributed to a good diagnostic yield of up to 79% compared with a yield of 74% in the histological examination of pleural biopsies. Furthermore, our study provides updated data about pleural fluid findings in tuberculous pleurisy and shows that the lymphocyte percentage of pleural fluid was negatively associated with the probability of a positive effusion culture. The differences between effusion culture-positive and culture-negative tuberculous pleurisy were highlighted in our study.

In this study, we cannot conclude that the combination of effusion and sputum cultures results in a higher yield than pleural biopsy because only 149 out of 382 patients received pleural biopsies, and the decision to perform a pleural biopsy may be a source of bias. Pleural biopsy is considered a reference procedure to diagnose tuberculous pleurisy due to its high yield and fast result. A prospective study showed a sensitivity of 66% and 100% for histological examination of closed needle and thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, respectively. In 131 patients who received all examinations of pleural biopsy, effusion, and sputum mycobacterial cultures in our study, pleural biopsy has the highest sensitivity.

### Pleural tuberculoma presenting as a solitary pleural mass in a child [^1152LqtC]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pleural tuberculoma is often observed during the treatment for tuberculous pleurisy; however, this condition is rarely found as a solitary pleural nodule in patients without a history of tuberculosis treatment, and no cases have been reported in children. We report a case of a 12-year-old boy with pleural tuberculoma presenting as a solitary mass. He had a fever and cough that prompted chest radiography, which revealed a mass in the right lung. Symptoms improved with antibacterial medication; however, computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5-cm pleural mass that partially bordered the ribs. CT-guided biopsy revealed a necrotizing granuloma, but the real-time polymerase chain reaction result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Malignant diseases, such as osteosarcoma, could not be ruled out; thus, surgical resection was performed, and pleural tuberculoma was diagnosed. The patient was treated with antituberculosis drugs for 6 months, and no recurrence was observed in the following 2 years. Pleural tuberculomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary pleural tumors, especially in countries where tuberculosis is endemic.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion [^115xuVJx]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion affects more than 1.5 million people in the United States each year and often complicates the management of heart failure, pneumonia, and malignancy. It occurs when fluid collects between the parietal and visceral pleura.

Processes causing a distortion in body fluid mechanics, such as in heart failure or nephrotic syndrome, tend to cause transudative effusions, whereas localized inflammatory or malignant processes are often associated with exudative effusions. Patients can be asymptomatic or can present with cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain.

Dullness to percussion on physical examination suggests an effusion; chest radiography can confirm the diagnosis. Thoracentesis may be indicated to diagnose effusion and relieve symptoms. Ultrasound guidance is preferred when aspirating fluid.

Routine assays for aspirated fluid include protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, Gram staining, cytology, and pH measurement. Light's criteria should be used to differentiate exudative from transudative effusions. Additional laboratory assays, bronchoscopy, percutaneous pleural biopsy, or thoracoscopy may be required for diagnosis if the initial test results are inconclusive.

### Pleural tuberculosis: an update [^112AdCAt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pleural tuberculosis accounts for fewer than 1% of all exudative effusions in Western countries, occurring in only 3–5% of tuberculous patients. However, in developing countries like India, it is responsible for 30–80% of all pleural effusions encountered and may complicate tuberculosis in 31% of all cases. Thus, tuberculous pleuritis remains a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Tuberculous pleurisy presents a diagnostic and therapeutic problem due to the low sensitivity of the diagnostic tools. There have been many advances in the field that we have attempted to update.

- **Recent findings**: Due to the limitations of conventional tests and the delay of several weeks for mycobacterial culture results, there has been a resurgence of interest in newer rapid tests and biomarkers. This review highlights the deficiencies of the traditional tests, while providing an overview of the newer tests. In addition, we provide an update on the changing epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment options.

- **Summary**: Newer immunological tests and scoring systems will revolutionize the way tuberculous pleurisy is diagnosed in the years ahead. Future research needs include validating the available diagnostic tests in larger randomized studies, finding newer specific biomarkers that are simple, accurate, and cost-effective for the developing world, and determining treatment regimens specific for tuberculous pleurisy.

### Revisiting tuberculous pleurisy: Pleural fluid characteristics and diagnostic yield of mycobacterial culture in an endemic area [^112kqbx3]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy is traditionally indicated by extreme lymphocytosis in pleural fluid and low yield of effusion culture. However, there is considerable inconsistency among previous study results. In addition, these data should be updated due to early effusion studies and advances in culture methods.

- **Methods**: From January 2004 to June 2009, patients with tuberculous pleurisy were retrospectively identified from the mycobacteriology laboratories and the pathology and tuberculosis registration databases of two hospitals in Taiwan, where tuberculosis is endemic. Pleural fluid characteristics and yields of mycobacterial cultures using liquid media were evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 382 patients with tuberculous pleurisy were identified. The median lymphocyte percentage of total cells in pleural fluids was 84% (IQR 64–95%), and 17% of cases had a lymphocyte percentage of less than 50%. The lymphocyte percentage was negatively associated with the probability of a positive effusion culture (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99). The diagnostic yields were 63% for effusion culture, 48% for sputum culture, 79% for the combination of effusion and sputum cultures, and 74% for histological examination of pleural biopsy specimens.

- **Conclusion**: The degree of lymphocyte predominance in tuberculous pleurisy was lower than previously thought. The lymphocyte percentage in pleural fluid was negatively associated with the probability of a positive effusion culture. With the implementation of a liquid culture method, the sensitivity of effusion culture was much higher than has been previously reported.

### Cryptogenic organising pneumonia: An unusual cause of pleuritic chest pain [^111D7gA9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old woman presented with a 2-hour history of pleuritic chest pain with no other associated symptoms. Blood investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers and an elevated white cell count. On a chest radiograph, an airspace shadow indicative of a consolidation was prominent. This was followed by a CT scan of her thorax, which showed a spiculated lesion in the right upper lobe, a lesion in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe, and mildly enlarged right hilar lymph nodes. She was started on dual antibiotic therapy; however, the patient's clinical status and inflammatory markers did not improve. A bronchoscopy was performed, which excluded malignancy and atypical pathogens. CT-guided biopsy confirmed the presence of cryptogenic organising pneumonia. Prednisolone 50 mg daily was prescribed, resulting in a quick resolution of symptoms.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^111zsQYD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health burden. Over seven million people were infected with TB in 2022, and 1.3 million died from the disease. Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), among which tuberculous pleuritis (TBP) is one of the most common subtypes, poses additional obstacles to global TB control due to its difficulty in diagnosis. This review highlights the latest epidemiology of TBP, the heterogeneity of its presentation, and the performance of different diagnostic strategies.

### Pleural effusion: What lies underneath [^111TVyA8]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant mesothelioma is a tumour of serous surfaces mainly arising at the pleura or the peritoneum. The diagnosis encompasses multiple problems as there is no pathognomonic hallmark for the disease; there are multiple histological types, and the differentiation from other tumours, such as adenocarcinoma or metastatic pleural disease, can represent quite a challenge. Usually, a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma carries a dismal prognosis with scarce therapeutic options. The present report concerns a patient with a diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma with endobronchial extension. Biopsy specimens were obtained through fibreoptic bronchoscopy and blind needle pleural biopsy. The final diagnosis was only possible after careful histological evaluation with a combination of immunohistochemical markers.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pleural mesothelioma, the NCCN 2024 guidelines emphasize the recognition of mesothelioma in situ as a preinvasive, single-layer surface proliferation of neoplastic mesothelial cells. The diagnosis of mesothelioma in situ cannot be made using conventional H&E stains alone; it requires one of the following:

- **Loss of BAP1 nuclear expression**: This must be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
- **CDKN2A homozygous deletion**: This should be identified either by FISH or by MTAP immunohistochemistry, indicated by cytoplasmic staining.

Furthermore, no mass lesions should be identified on imaging or thoracoscopy.

### Mechanisms of T-lymphocyte accumulation during experimental pleural infection induced by Mycobacterium bovis BCG [^115NAvEp]. Infection and Immunity (2008). Low credibility.

Tuberculous pleurisy is a frequent extrapulmonary manifestation characterized by the accumulation of fluid and inflammatory cells in the pleural space. We investigated the mechanisms of T-lymphocyte accumulation in the pleural space using a murine model of pleurisy induced by Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Intrathoracic (i.t.) injection of BCG (4.5 × 10⁵ bacteria/cavity) induced the accumulation of T lymphocytes in the pleural cavities of C57BL/6 mice.

We observed the presence of colony-forming units (CFU) in pleural washes conducted 1, 2, 3, 7, and 15 days after pleurisy induction. Pretreatment with fucoidan inhibited T-lymphocyte accumulation at 1 day, but not at 15 days, after BCG-induced pleurisy. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled blood mononuclear cells to infected mice showed that T lymphocytes migrated into the pleural cavity 1 day (but not 15 days) after BCG injection.

- **In vitro T-cell transmigration**: Cell-free pleural wash fluids recovered from mice 1 day after BCG i.t. stimulation (day 1 BCG-PW), but not day 7 or day 15 BCG-PW, induced in vitro T-cell transmigration, which was dependent on L-, P-, and E-selectins.
- **In vitro T-lymphocyte proliferation**: Day 7 BCG-PW (but not day 1 BCG-PW) induced in vitro T-lymphocyte proliferation via interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Accordingly, in vivo IL-2 or IFN-gamma neutralization abolished T-lymphocyte accumulation 7 days after pleurisy induction.

Our results demonstrate that pleural infection induced by BCG leads to T-lymphocyte accumulation in two waves. The acute phase depends on selectin-mediated migration, while the second wave of T-lymphocyte accumulation is influenced by interleukin-2 and gamma interferon signaling.

### Corticosteroids for tuberculous pleurisy [^114iBiE2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are hormones produced by the adrenal cortex that have a variety of physiological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, regulation of electrolytes, stress response, and control of inflammation. They induce their anti-inflammatory effect through the regulation of gene expression in cells, leading to increased expression of genes that inhibit inflammatory pathways and repression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory proteins. Multiple synthetic forms of these hormones have been produced and are used in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid derived from cortisol, and prednisone is a pro-drug that is converted into the active form prednisolone by the liver. Several formulations of each drug are used for different conditions and diseases; in TB pleurisy, patients are usually offered them in tablet form.

Corticosteroids have been used in medicine for many decades and have well-characterized adverse effect profiles. Adverse effects for medium to long-term use include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, gastric ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, thinning of the skin, proximal myopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and development of moon face, striae, and acne (Cushing's syndrome). The use of synthetic corticosteroids can induce adrenocorticoid insufficiency, so patients receiving more than one week's treatment must have the dose slowly reduced to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency.

The outcome of the study is illustrated in Figure 2, which depicts the 180-day survival curve of patients with positive and negative effusion cultures. The probability of survival significantly differed based on the effusion culture results (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Among patients with positive effusion cultures, 21 (9%) deaths occurred before the time of diagnosis.

### Successful treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pleurisy with acute fever by antimycobacterial therapy [^114rytof]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We report two cases of pleurisy caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria followed by pneumothorax. The onset of pleurisy was accompanied by acute fever. Cultured samples of the pleural effusions from the two patients, an 80-year-old man and an 87-year-old woman, were ultimately found to contain Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium kansasii, respectively. Both patients were initially administered antibiotics, but their fevers persisted. Therefore, different combinations of antimycobacterial drugs were used, which reduced the fever in a few days. In these patients, pleurisy caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria followed by pneumothorax was characterized by acute fever and improvement in the fever after administration of antimycobacterial drugs; however, the etiology remains to be clarified.

### Association of underlying comorbidities and sites of tuberculosis: An analysis using surveillance data [^113h4SGd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multivariable analysis for the location of TB development:

- **TB pleurisy**: Variables include elderly age (OR = 1.01), higher BMI (OR = 1.05), presence of CKD (OR = 1.93), symptoms of dyspnea (OR = 5.13), chest pain (OR = 7.19), and fever (OR = 1.60).

- **TB lymphadenitis**: Variables include younger age (OR = 0.97), female sex (OR = 3.41), higher BMI (OR = 1.11), and absence of fever (OR = 0.46).

- **Abdominal TB**: Variables include younger age (OR = 0.98), female sex (OR = 1.41), higher BMI (OR = 1.07), absence of diabetes (OR = 0.54), presence of CLD (OR = 2.69), and absence of fever (OR = 0.59).

- **Bone/joint TB**: Variables include older age (OR = 1.01), female sex (OR = 1.75), and absence of weight loss (OR = 0.31).

- **CNS TB**: Variables include younger age (OR = 0.98), higher BMI (OR = 1.13), and presence of fever (OR = 4.58).

- **Urogenital TB**: Variables include higher BMI (OR = 1.12) and presence of CKD (OR = 2.75).

The results of the logistic regression are summarized in Table 2. The AUCs of the ROC curve for TB pleurisy, TB lymphadenitis, abdominal TB, bone/joint TB, CNS TB, and urogenital TB were 0.76, 0.77, 0.66, 0.60, 0.70, and 0.65, respectively (refer to Additional File 5). The five-fold cross-validation for predictive validity was 0.91, 0.95, 0.96, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 for each site.

PTB was associated with older age (OR = 1.10), male sex (OR = 1.83), lower BMI (OR = 0.89), presence of chronic lung disease (OR = 1.46), presence of symptoms of cough/phlegm (OR = 3.83), general weakness (OR = 2.2), and weight loss.

### Diagnostic tools in tuberculous pleurisy: A direct comparative study [^112BM4t9]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Thoracoscopy is the most accurate yet most expensive tool for establishing the diagnosis of tuberculous (TB) pleurisy. However, most high TB-incidence regions have limited financial resources, lack the infrastructure needed for routine thoracoscopy, and require an alternative, cost-effective diagnostic approach for pleural effusions. Altogether, 51 patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions were recruited for a prospective, direct comparison between bronchial wash, pleural fluid microbiology and biochemistry (adenosine deaminase (ADA) and cell count), closed needle biopsy, and medical thoracoscopy. The final diagnosis was TB in 42 patients (82%), malignancy in five (10%), and idiopathic in four patients (8%).

- **Sensitivity findings**: Sensitivity of histology, culture, and combined histology/culture was 66%, 48%, and 79%, respectively, for closed needle biopsy and 100%, 76%, and 100%, respectively, for thoracoscopy. Both were 100% specific.

- **Pleural fluid ADA results**: Pleural fluid ADA of ≥ 50 U × L⁻¹ was 95% sensitive and 89% specific. Combined ADA, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio ≥ 0.75 plus closed needle biopsy reached 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

A combination of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase, differential cell count, and closed needle biopsy has a high diagnostic accuracy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions in areas with high incidences of tuberculosis and might substitute medical thoracoscopy at considerably lower expense in resource-poor countries.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: Clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^113e3Jj8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a global challenge with high mortality and morbidity. Tuberculous pleuritis (TBP) is an important subtype of TB that presents diagnostic difficulties. Available clinical and laboratory diagnostic tools are imperfect. Clinicians should remain vigilant about the possibility of TBP, irrespective of local TB prevalence. The diagnosis of TBP should be pursued by confirmatory tests whenever possible. Empirical TB treatment for TBP is not without risk, especially in elderly and/or immunocompromised hosts. Awareness that some TB pleural effusions may be neutrophilic rather than lymphocytic is important.

### Epidemiology, presentation and treatment of pleural effusion [^112KgXUZ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion (PE) is the most common manifestation of pleural disorders. In children, PE is usually secondary to an underlying disorder. In developing countries, PE most frequently results as a complication of bacterial pneumonia. A high index of suspicion is required to avoid delays in diagnosis that may influence treatment and outcome. The diagnosis of PE in children is based on chest radiographs, thoracentesis, and pleural fluid analysis. This review discusses the usefulness of diagnostic methods and treatment in children with parapneumonic pleural effusion.

### Rheumatoid pleurisy confirmed by biopsy of a chest wall nodule by thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia [^113boNTs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid pleurisy is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but distinguishing it from other diseases, such as heart failure and tuberculous pleurisy, is often difficult. A man in his 70s with stable rheumatoid arthritis presented with cardiac enlargement and bilateral pleural effusion on chest radiography. Pleural fluid studies showed lymphocytosis, adenosine deaminase level of 51.6 U/L, and rheumatoid factor level of 2245.3 IU/mL, suggestive of rheumatoid pleurisy and tuberculous pleurisy. Thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia revealed erythema of the parietal pleura, small papillary projections, and fibrin deposits. H&E-stained biopsy specimens showed inflammatory granulomas with strong lymphocytic infiltration and non-caseating granulomas. He was diagnosed with rheumatoid pleurisy. His symptoms improved with 30 mg of prednisolone. This study highlights that biopsy using thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia effectively diagnoses rheumatoid pleurisy, which may be challenging to diagnose.

### Contrast-enhanced sonography for differential diagnosis of pleurisy and focal pleural lesions of unknown cause [^1122xqfj]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Ultrasound enables the visualization of pleural-based lesions with a poor correlation to specific pathology. At this time, there are no data about the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced sonography (CES) in pleural lesions.

- **Methods**: From August 2004 to January 2005, 25 consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of pleurisy and focal pleural lesions of unknown origin seen on B-mode ultrasonography were prospectively studied by CES. The lesions were diagnosed as pleuropneumonia (n = 12), pulmonary embolism/infarction (n = 7), malignant lymphoma (n = 2), pleural metastasis (n = 2), granuloma (n = 1), and unknown cause (n = 1). The diagnosis of the lesions was confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT scanning (n = 20), scintigraphy (n = 3), and follow-up (n = 2). Time to the enhancement of the contrast agent was determined. The CES patterns were evaluated during the arterial phase (i.e. 2 to 30 seconds) and the parenchymal phase (i.e. 1 to 5 minutes). The extent of the enhancement of pleural lesions was classified using normal liver tissue as an in vivo reference (absent, hypoechoic, isoechoic, hyperechoic, or mixed echogenicity).

- **Results**: In 20 patients, an enhancement of the pleural lesion was seen. All 12 patients with pleuropneumonia had a short time to enhancement (between 1 and 6 seconds) and a marked enhancement (isoechoic/hyperechoic) during the arterial and parenchymal phase. In the remaining 13 patients with diagnoses other than pleuropneumonia, 5 had no enhancement, and 8 had a delayed time to enhancement (> 6 seconds). The extent of the enhancement was reduced.

### Diagnosis and management of lupus pleuritis [^114Xc5rE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that can affect any organ system. Predominant manifestations include arthralgia, rash, photosensitivity, pleuritis, and renal and central nervous system involvement. Fortunately, pleuritis in systemic lupus erythematosus is not usually as life-threatening as renal or central nervous system complications. Nevertheless, pleuritis does occur in systemic lupus erythematosus and may be a significant cause of morbidity. In addition to primary pleuritis attributed to systemic lupus erythematosus, secondary pleural complications, especially infections, may occur as a consequence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Pleuritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus may therefore frequently challenge the diagnostic and therapeutic acumen of physicians.

- **Results**: There were 3,263 patients with definite or suspicious TB during the study period. Among these patients, 792 had tuberculous pleurisy or another form of TB disease with associated pleural effusion. Three patients with positive AFB smears in their pleural fluids were considered to have tuberculous empyema and were excluded from the analysis.

Among the remaining 789 patients, 382 were diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy: 241 had effusion cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 141 had negative effusion cultures. In the 141 patients with negative effusion cultures, 48 were diagnosed by pleural biopsy, 45 had positive sputum cultures with pleural effusion that resolved with anti-TB treatment, and 48 were clinical suspicions with pleural effusion resolving upon treatment.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 382 patients:

| **Characteristic** | **Count** |
|-|-|
| Positive effusion culture | 241 |
| Negative effusion culture | 141 |
| Diagnosis by pleural biopsy | 48 |
| Positive sputum cultures | 45 |
| Clinical suspicions | 48 |

### Multidisciplinary approach to connective tissue disease (CTD) related pleural effusions: a four-year retrospective evaluation [^113P2W5f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

A new pleural effusion may be caused by a wide range of conditions. The British Thoracic Society produced guidelines in 2010 recommending a systematic approach to achieve a diagnosis, aiming to streamline investigations and interventions. Since then, the evidence base for managing malignant and infective effusions has developed through a series of clinical trials. In comparison, research on benign non-infective pleural effusions has been more limited. A number of these are caused by connective tissue diseases (CTD).

Pleural effusions from CTD are caused by increased capillary permeability, as extravascular fluid moves from the lung's interstitium, across the mesothelium into the pleural space. This may be due to several reasons, such as a pleural infiltrative process. In addition, circulating immune complexes that localize to the pleura can activate the complement system, causing endothelial injury. Enzyme and free radical release from white blood cells also accentuate the inflammatory process.

CTD-related pleural effusions are rare and challenging to diagnose. The most common CTDs to affect the pleura are rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A prospective observational cohort study over seven years at a specialist pleural unit identified 356 nonmalignant pleural effusions. Among these, 9.8% were diagnosed as inflammatory pleuritis, and 7.6% were attributed to other diagnoses, including chylothorax, rheumatic causes, trauma, and drug-induced causes.

The same unit emphasized the value of a pleural specialist team to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and management in these cases.

### Malignant pleural effusion: Presentation, diagnosis, and management [^114XqEt3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained; this is typically done via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.
