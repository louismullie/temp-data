## Question

IR biopsy interpretation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about image-guided biopsy interpretation, specifically how to approach radiologic–pathologic correlation, concordance assessment, and management of discordant results across organ systems. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle of radiologic–pathologic correlation and why it matters. Then, I should verify how to classify concordance and what thresholds define discordance. Next, I will examine organ-specific nuances and pitfalls, including breast, liver, lung, bone, and prostate. After that, I need to check the role of molecular profiling and specimen adequacy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight quality assurance and documentation requirements, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: image-guided biopsy is not complete until the pathology result is correlated with the imaging phenotype to ensure the intended lesion was sampled and that the histology matches the expected biology, because discordance can mask malignancy and delay care. This is a universal requirement across modalities and organs and is explicitly mandated in breast, liver, lung, and musculoskeletal contexts, with professional society parameters emphasizing that the procedural physician is responsible for concordance assessment and downstream recommendations [^f8d1ab06] [^b02a11c0] [^69ecb261] [^2aebc992].

> I need to define concordance precisely. Concordant means the pathology aligns with the imaging features and pretest probability, whereas discordant means the pathology does not explain the imaging appearance or is inconsistent with the clinical context. Importantly, discordance includes both "false-negative" histology in a suspicious lesion and "false-positive" imaging that overcalls disease, and both scenarios warrant action rather than reassurance [^f8d1ab06] [^e49b4a42] [^2aebc992].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds. I should verify what constitutes a clinically meaningful discordance rate. In CT-guided biopsies, prospective review identified discordance in about 11% of cases, and more than half of those discordant cases ultimately proved malignant, underscoring the need to escalate rather than observe when discordant. Similarly, in breast MRI-guided biopsy, upgrade rates for discordant benign results can exceed 30%, which is why repeat core needle biopsy or excision is recommended when discordant [^2aebc992] [^ea23cdb3].

> Next, I should review organ-specific nuances, starting with breast. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy of guidance and the implications for concordance. Ultrasound is preferred when visible, but MRI-guided biopsy lacks real-time needle visualization and specimen radiography, making radiologic–pathologic correlation more challenging and increasing the risk of false negatives. Therefore, meticulous prebiopsy planning, postbiopsy marker imaging, and documentation of concordance are essential, and discordant benign results should trigger repeat biopsy or excision rather than surveillance [^b8673404] [^69ecb261] [^ea23cdb3].

> For liver, I should confirm when image guidance changes outcomes. Real-time ultrasound guidance is the standard for parenchymal liver biopsy because it improves safety and diagnostic yield, especially in patients with small livers, obesity, or ascites. In focal lesions, targeting the viable rim rather than necrotic centers improves diagnostic accuracy, and adequacy criteria such as length and portal tracts matter for staging fibrosis, so I need to ensure the specimen meets quality benchmarks before concluding concordance [^1193946d] [^e5a42dbd] [^33a78308].

> For lung, I should double-check the implications of a negative biopsy. Negative results must be interpreted in the context of pretest probability. If malignancy risk is intermediate to high, repeat biopsy, surgical excision, or close imaging surveillance is appropriate because sampling error and false negatives are not rare, and molecular profiling is often required for advanced disease, so a nondiagnostic result is not the end of the road [^d707fb20] [^e771b23b] [^4575d2f5].

> For bone and soft tissue, let me consider lesion heterogeneity and sampling strategy. Bone lesions have higher nondiagnostic rates than soft tissue, and targeting the most metabolically active area on PET/CT does not reliably reduce the number of samples needed; thus, obtaining at least three cores and selecting the safest, most viable site remain prudent, and discordant results should prompt repeat biopsy or open excision in a multidisciplinary sarcoma framework [^aa3b862d] [^02562fbd] [^c40b8ece].

> For prostate, I should confirm how PI-RADS shapes concordance decisions. PI-RADS 3 lesions are a gray zone; while many are benign, a meaningful minority harbor clinically significant cancer, so decisions to biopsy should integrate PSA density, clinical risk, and patient preference, and negative targeted cores do not fully exclude disease, reinforcing the need to correlate with MRI features and consider repeat MRI or biopsy if suspicion remains [^da6486e5] [^e6d1afc4] [^f87011c7].

> I will now examine the role of molecular profiling and specimen adequacy. In modern oncology, adequate tissue for DNA, RNA, and protein analysis is often as critical as histologic diagnosis, so I need to ensure sufficient viable tumor is sampled and that the pathology report documents tumor content and suitability for molecular testing. This is especially relevant in lung, liver, breast, and bone sarcomas, where molecular results guide therapy selection and clinical trial eligibility [^8e33cbf7] [^408a08d4] [^4575d2f5].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, but I should verify each branch against guidelines. If pathology is concordant and benign, routine follow-up is appropriate. If pathology is concordant and malignant, proceed to staging and treatment. If pathology is discordant, do not accept the result. Instead, repeat image review, consider repeat percutaneous biopsy with a different modality or approach, or proceed to surgical excision, and escalate urgency when the imaging suspicion is high or the clinical stakes are great. Throughout, document the concordance assessment and communicate clearly with the referring clinician and patient [^f8d1ab06] [^e49b4a42] [^2aebc992].

> But wait, what if the "discordance" reflects a technical failure rather than true biological discrepancy. I should confirm that the biopsy track, marker position, and specimen adequacy were appropriate. In breast, postbiopsy mammography verifies clip position. In liver, real-time imaging confirms needle placement. In lung, postbiopsy CT can detect pneumothorax and assess sampling site. When in doubt, repeating the procedure with improved targeting or a different guidance modality is preferable to anchoring on a misleading result [^69ecb261] [^1193946d] [^4575d2f5].

> Next, I should review quality assurance and documentation requirements. Facilities must track concordance rates, upgrade rates, and complications, and radiologists who interpret studies without performing biopsies should still follow up on recommendations and audit outcomes. Standardized reporting templates and multidisciplinary review improve consistency and catch errors, and this is explicitly required for breast MRI, DBT, and CEM programs [^b02a11c0] [^c1f068a7] [^8683d39b].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient-centered communication is embedded in the process. Patients should be counseled preprocedure about the possibility of discordance and the need for repeat biopsy or surgery, and results should be communicated promptly with clear next steps. Rapid-result pathways can reduce anxiety but must be balanced with time for accurate pathology review and multidisciplinary coordination [^d7b25f14] [^ce89a79d].

Interventional radiology (IR) biopsy interpretation centers on **radiologic–pathologic concordance** [^f8d1ab06] and **specimen adequacy** to guide management. Concordant results align imaging and pathology; discordant results require repeat biopsy or surgical excision [^e49b4a42]. Adequate tissue volume and quality are essential for accurate diagnosis and molecular profiling [^8e33cbf7]; insufficient samples may necessitate repeat biopsy [^f8d1ab06]. Multidisciplinary review is critical for complex or equivocal cases, and clear documentation of concordance and recommendations is mandatory [^b02a11c0].

---

## Radiologic–pathologic concordance

Radiologic–pathologic concordance is the cornerstone of IR biopsy interpretation, ensuring the histopathologic findings match the imaging features and clinical context [^f8d1ab06]. Concordant results support the diagnosis and guide appropriate management, whereas **discordant results** warrant further evaluation [^e49b4a42].

- **Concordant results**: The pathology report aligns with the imaging features and clinical suspicion, supporting the diagnosis and guiding management [^f8d1ab06].
- **Discordant results**: The pathology report does not match the imaging features or clinical suspicion, necessitating further evaluation, repeat biopsy, or surgical excision [^e49b4a42].

---

## Specimen adequacy

Specimen adequacy is critical for accurate diagnosis and downstream testing. Adequate tissue volume and quality are essential for histopathologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling [^8e33cbf7]. Insufficient tissue may lead to **nondiagnostic results** or inability to perform necessary ancillary tests, prompting repeat biopsy [^f8d1ab06].

---

## Common pitfalls and challenges

Several pitfalls and challenges can complicate IR biopsy interpretation:

- **Sampling error**: Inadequate sampling of the lesion, particularly in heterogeneous tumors, can result in false-negative or nondiagnostic results [^aa3b862d].
- **Tissue artifact**: Artifacts from tissue processing or handling can obscure histopathologic features, complicating interpretation [^notfound].
- **Interpretive error**: Misinterpretation of histopathologic findings, particularly in lesions with overlapping features, can lead to incorrect diagnoses [^f87011c7].

---

## Role of multidisciplinary review

Multidisciplinary review is essential for complex cases, particularly when results are discordant or when rare or aggressive malignancies are suspected. Collaboration among interventional radiologists, pathologists, and referring clinicians ensures **accurate diagnosis and appropriate management** [^fc1cc34f].

---

## Documentation and communication

Clear documentation and communication of biopsy results, including concordance assessment and management recommendations, are essential. The interventional radiologist must document the following:

- **Concordance assessment**: Whether the pathology results are concordant or discordant with imaging findings [^b02a11c0].
- **Management recommendations**: Appropriate follow-up, repeat biopsy, or surgical excision based on concordance assessment [^ea23cdb3].
- **Communication**: Results and recommendations must be communicated to the referring clinician and, when appropriate, to the patient [^ce89a79d].

---

## Emerging trends and advancements

Recent advancements in IR biopsy interpretation include the integration of **molecular profiling** [^8e33cbf7] and **liquid biopsy** [^408a08d4] into diagnostic workflows. These approaches enable personalized medicine and improved diagnostic accuracy, particularly in oncology [^99ad6a99].

---

Interventional radiology biopsy interpretation relies on **radiologic–pathologic concordance**, **specimen adequacy**, and **multidisciplinary review** to ensure accurate diagnosis and guide management. Clear documentation and communication are essential, and emerging trends such as molecular profiling and liquid biopsy are shaping the future of biopsy interpretation.

### Image-guided biopsy: what the interventional radiologist needs to know about PET / CT [^744ab16e]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly used in evaluation of oncology patients. Because PET/CT can demonstrate malignancy before morphologic changes are evident, application of PET/CT information to image-guided biopsy can facilitate early histologic diagnosis and staging. However, because FDG uptake is not specific to cancer, PET/CT findings may raise questions about whether uptake in a lesion is an indication for biopsy. To properly select patients for image-guided biopsy, interventional radiologists should be familiar with the biologic significance of FDG uptake and various causes of false-positive uptake. PET/CT images may also become a source of confusion in the interpretation of biopsy results. Various causes of false-positive and false-negative FDG uptake need to be considered, especially when there is a discrepancy between biopsy results and PET/CT findings. False-negative FDG uptake can result from cancers that are too small to be observed or not FDG avid. False-positive FDG uptake can be due to underlying inflammation from recent treatment. Conversely, complete resolution of FDG uptake in a treated lesion does not necessarily indicate absence of viable cells. When questions about PET/CT findings arise in the context of image-guided biopsy, discussion with experienced nuclear imaging physicians is essential.

Oncology is undergoing a revolutionary change. Image-guided biopsy is expected to play an increasingly important role in this radical transformation. Current concepts of disease and treatment are based on an established set of physical signs and symptoms and laboratory tests broken down by organ system. However, soon diseases will be categorized and treated based on much more specific and detailed molecular and genetic information. This transformation in how disease is categorized and treated will depend on the ability to harvest tissue from tumors and analyze it appropriately.

### Image-guided biopsy in the age of personalised medicine: strategies for success and safety [^8e33cbf7]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Oncology has progressed into an era of personalised medicine, whereby the therapeutic regimen is tailored to the molecular profile of the patient's cancer. Determining personalised therapeutic options is achieved by using tumour genomics and proteomics to identify the specific molecular targets against which candidate drugs can interact. Several dozen targeted drugs, many for multiple cancer types are already widely in clinical use. Molecular profiling of tumours is contingent on high-quality biopsy specimens and the most common method of tissue sampling is image-guided biopsy. Thus, for radiologists performing these biopsies, the paradigm has now shifted away from obtaining specimens simply for histopathological diagnosis to acquiring larger amounts of viable tumour cells for DNA, RNA, or protein analysis. These developments have highlighted the central role now played by radiologists in the delivery of personalised cancer care. This review describes the principles of molecular profiling assays and biopsy techniques for optimising yield, and describes a scoring system to assist in patient selection for percutaneous biopsy.

### Image-guided biopsy of breast lesions-when to use what biopsy technique [^deff8372]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this manuscript, an international expert statement is provided for the biopsy of breast lesions. While previous studies have focused on sensitivities and specificities of biopsy techniques a clear recommendation when to use what approach has been absent. Using a RAND/UCLA approach with interactive discussion on discrepantly scored items resulted in a general expert opinion of the optimal biopsy method for most lesions under most image-guiding modalities.

The panel agreed that ultrasound is, in principle, the guiding method of choice, due to procedural ease, flexibility of the approach, patient comfort, and real-time feedback. Other methods (e.g. DBT or MRI) are appropriate when the lesion is not visible under ultrasound. The lack of real-time feedback with other imaging methods, and the often subtle or diffuse nature of lesions without a clear ultrasound correlate led to the general statement that biopsy under imaging techniques other than ultrasound should be performed using VAB in all cases. Consequently, no further stratification on lesion types was attempted for guidance methods other than US. While data on biopsy accuracy with different methods is limited for other imaging techniques, such as CEM or dedicated breast CT, a few recent studies on CEM-guided biopsy provide valuable initial clinical insights. These studies reported early clinical experiences with CEM-guided biopsy in general using VAB, suggesting its potential utility. However, further research is necessary to validate these results. It is acknowledged that not all hospitals will have the possibility to perform VAB under all imaging methods, and it is recognized that sometimes CNB under other modalities can give conclusive answers. However, when this is attempted, radiological-pathological correlation is essential, and in case of doubt, localization and surgical excisional biopsy should be performed.

### Liver biopsy [^bdbf6365]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy — training and competency recommendations are as follows: Specific training for liver biopsy is essential and is recommended for those who perform it (Class I, Level C). Liver biopsy should be taught to trainees by experts, highly experienced in the practice of liver biopsy and management of its potential complications (Class I, Level C). Although the number of biopsies required to become adequately trained is unknown, it is recommended that operators perform at least 40 biopsies (Class I, Level C). Training in percutaneous liver biopsy should include specific training in ultrasound interpretation of fundamental liver anatomy and other landmarks (Class I, Level C). Image-guided liver biopsy should be taught to trainees by experts who themselves have adequate training and experience with the technique (Class I, Level C).

### Integrating pathology and radiology disciplines: an emerging opportunity? [^fc1cc34f]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The general benefits of pathology-radiology integration

Beyond the documented need for improved management of specific diseases, many potential benefits would derive from pathology-radiology integration and, therefore, argue for its universal adoption. These include:

▪ Report standardization. Multidisciplinary collaborations foster the use of controlled terminologies and standardized reporting structures, making evaluation across multiple patient cohorts possible.

▪ Clinical efficiency. Diagnostic radiology-pathology integration would yield reporting that is accessible via a single portal, which could free more time for interpretation and decision making.

▪ Registry development. The aggregation of diagnostic imaging and pathology data into a single resource would facilitate the development of rich databases for disease registries, which would enable or improve:

- quality assurance,

- identification of potential research cohorts,

- research data mining, and

- efficient access by tumor registries.

▪ Tumor board presentation. The integrated report may lessen preparation time for multidisciplinary tumor board conferences and would be a valuable educational resource for medical students and residents.

▪ Research and innovations. Recent advances in both pathology and radiology, are encouraging more cooperation between the two disciplines in situations in which tumors can be identified with certainty at an earlier stage than in the past and then characterized at the molecular level. Rapid access to comprehensive pathology and radiology findings will be necessary to enable novel translational research activities, including, for example, the use of a multidisciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board as a means to assess the molecular findings of specific patients and make recommendations for their treatment.

▪ Improved patient care. Diagnostic radiology-pathology integration would improve patient care. In addition to the benefits noted above, greater coordination would encourage the use of less invasive techniques, such as needle biopsies, while monitoring each event to assure that adequate material is available for additional studies, including molecular diagnostics.

Consequently, between the imaging and pathology worlds, a movement is growing to develop systematic processes that can exploit both the integration of diagnostic information and the flow of small tissue samples obtained from image-guided biopsy from radiology to pathology. This multidisciplinary effort has led to a number of recommendations for pathologic and molecular diagnosis, as well as radiologic practice.

### Bone and soft tissue tumors: interventional techniques for diagnosis and treatment [^7cc48ba5]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Radiologists have an integral role in the diagnosis of bone and soft-tissue tumors beyond image interpretation. Image-guided biopsies are used to diagnose and stage musculoskeletal tumors. This article reviews the steps of minimally invasive image-guided biopsies, from prebiopsy planning through postbiopsy pathology follow-up. Helpful techniques to perform and troubleshoot these procedures adequately and safely are detailed. Radiologists are also expanding the treatment options available for many benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors. Some of these more frequently performed procedures include percutaneous thermal ablation and cementoplasty. The evidence, indications, and basic principles of these interventional procedures are also discussed.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography-guided biopsy: principles, challenges, and opportunities [^5d40b09a]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic foundations of CEM-guided biopsy

CEM: an overview

CEM has gained widespread clinical adoption since its approval, due to its high sensitivity, moderate specificity, and compatibility with standard mammographic practice. While breast MRI demonstrates superior pooled diagnostic odds ratios, CEM offers a practical alternative for many clinical scenarios, including screening recalls and symptomatic cases. Meta-analyses have confirmed its strong diagnostic value and suggest that CEM may offer slightly higher specificity than MRI in some indications.

CEM is more cost-effective, integrates readily into existing mammographic infrastructure, and is often preferred by patients due to shorter examination times and greater comfort, despite the need for breast compression. These advantages have driven its growing use, especially in centres with limited MRI access.

RC images and lesion conspicuity

RC images are created by subtracting a high-energy image (HE) from LE acquisitions to highlight iodinated contrast distribution. These images form the basis for lesion targeting in CEM-guided biopsy.

According to the BI-RADS® CEM supplement, lesion conspicuity is defined as the degree to which an enhancing finding stands out relative to background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and is categorised as low, moderate, or marked.

Higher BPE is often associated with dense breasts and premenopausal status. Concordance between CEM and MRI has been demonstrated for BPE assessment, although MRI generally yields higher conspicuity, particularly for benign findings. Lesion conspicuity likely affects biopsy feasibility, but its impact on diagnostic confidence has not yet been systematically assessed.

RC-only findings and diagnostic implications

The term RC-only findings refers to enhancing lesions visible on RC images without a correlate on LE images, and thus not usually targetable using conventional image-guided biopsy. This terminology is consistent with current clinical practice and BI-RADS® recommendations for CEM interpretation.

RC-only lesions are a key indication for CEM-guided biopsy. Their reported prevalence ranges from 4% to 31.2%, with malignancy rates between 17.4% and 54.3%, influenced by differences in study design and clinical context. A 2022 retrospective study evaluating imaging features of screening-detected abnormalities on CEM found that 50% of true-positive malignancies presented as RC-only findings, underscoring their clinical relevance.

The biological behaviour of RC-only findings is still under investigation, but preliminary MRI data suggest they may correspond to earlier-stage or biologically less aggressive malignancies. In this context, recognising and appropriately targeting these lesions is essential in CEM-based workflows to minimise the risk of missed malignancies.

### Interactive case review of radiologic and pathologic findings from breast biopsy: are they concordant? How do I manage the results? [^193f6b81]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

The number of imaging-guided percutaneous breast biopsies performed has steadily increased as imaging techniques have improved. Percutaneous biopsy is becoming more commonplace and supplanting excisional biopsy as the preferred diagnostic tool. The radiologist's role in caring for patients who undergo breast biopsy extends beyond imaging to identifying lesions for biopsy and then performing the procedure. Radiologists must also be cognizant of radiologic-pathologic correlation to determine whether biopsy results are concordant with imaging findings and make management recommendations. Management of microcalcifications, masses, and areas of asymmetry begins with recognizing and characterizing the findings with the proper Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. Determining concordance between imaging findings and histologic results is equally important. The decision to recommend surgical excision or short-term follow-up relies heavily on whether the histologic diagnosis correlates with the imaging findings, a determination that is part of the radiologist's responsibilities if he or she performs the biopsy.

### Image-guided breast biopsy and localisation: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^f8d1ab06]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathological-radiological correlation

For any combination of guidance methods and needle types, concordance between the cytological or pathological result and the radiological appearance of the targeted lesion has to be verified. This mandatory task must be performed by the professional who performed the image - guided sampling, usually a breast radiologist, in collaboration with the reporting pathologist.

In most cases, the radiologist will consider the cytology or pathology result as concordant with imaging findings, especially when CNB or VAB has been performed. However, in the case of inadequate sampling (more frequent in the case of FNS) or discordance between cytology/pathology and imaging findings, a repeat biopsy using the same or a different biopsy method can be considered, which is often after discussion in the multidisciplinary meeting. In the case of findings highly suspicious for malignancy on US, mammography/tomosynthesis, or MRI with discordant benign findings at FNS/CNB/VAB, it is also possible to go directly for surgical removal, after preoperative image-guided localisation, if the lesion is nonpalpable.

### Role of imaging-guided biopsy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^82e50875]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous imaging-guided biopsy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a relatively safe procedure with an established diagnostic role, and a growing value in providing prognostic and treatment information for patient's management. Because of the high specificity and positive predictive value of tumoral features on cross-sectional imaging studies, the number of biopsies performed for HCC is limited to certain specific clinical scenarios. However, routine imaging fails to fully capture the tumor's molecular heterogeneity, and as research unravels the potential of tumoral histopathological and molecular stratification, biopsy is poised to transition from a diagnostic tool to a powerful prognostication instrument, contributing to guiding personalized treatment management for patients with HCC. In this review paper, we explore the role of percutaneous, imaging-guided biopsy in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of HCC.

### Image-guided breast biopsy and localisation: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^d7b25f14]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

We summarise here the information to be provided to women and referring physicians about percutaneous breast biopsy and lesion localisation under imaging guidance. After explaining why a preoperative diagnosis with a percutaneous biopsy is preferred to surgical biopsy, we illustrate the criteria used by radiologists for choosing the most appropriate combination of device type for sampling and imaging technique for guidance. Then, we describe the commonly used devices, from fine - needle sampling to tissue biopsy with larger needles, namely core needle biopsy and vacuum - assisted biopsy, and how mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging work for targeting the lesion for sampling or localisation. The differences among the techniques available for localisation (carbon marking, metallic wire, radiotracer injection, radioactive seed, and magnetic seed localisation) are illustrated. Type and rate of possible complications are described and the issue of concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is also addressed. The importance of pathological - radiological correlation is highlighted: when evaluating the results of any needle sampling, the radiologist must check the concordance between the cytology/pathology report of the sample and the radiological appearance of the biopsied lesion. We recommend that special attention is paid to a proper and tactful approach when communicating to the woman the need for tissue sampling as well as the possibility of cancer diagnosis, repeat tissue sampling, and or even surgery when tissue sampling shows a lesion with uncertain malignant potential (also referred to as "high-risk" or B3 lesions). Finally, seven frequently asked questions are answered.

### Ultrasound guided core breast biopsies [^555c1c82]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Core needle biopsies are common procedures performed in breast imaging centers. Utilizing ultrasound guidance for biopsy of suspicious findings within the breast and axilla is the standard of care when lesions are visible on ultrasound. Most ultrasound guided breast biopsies are performed by radiologists interpreting breast imaging who correlate findings across modalities including mammography, ultrasound and breast MRI, however interventional radiologists may perform in some practice settings. Appropriate knowledge of complete breast imaging is important not only for localization, but for determining radiologic-pathologic concordance. Proper localization, technique, and post biopsy management are essential to the success of the procedure and providing proper care for patients. This article discusses indications, strategies for accurate targeting, how-to biopsy techniques, post biopsy considerations and radiologic-pathologic concordance incorporating recommendations from the American College of Radiology Practice Parameter for the Performance of Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Breast Interventional procedures.

### Image-guided biopsy in acute diskitis-osteomyelitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ae6f4ad9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND. The reported sensitivity and yield of image-guided biopsies for diskitis-osteomyelitis vary widely. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of pooled sensitivity data to elucidate strategies for optimal image-guided biopsies among patients suspected to have diskitis-osteomyelitis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION. A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies of patient populations with proven or suspected diskitis-osteomyelitis that included percutaneous image-guided biopsy as part of the workup algorithm. Type of pathogens, imaging modality used for biopsy guidance, tissue targeted, antibiotic administration at the time of biopsy, true microbiology positives, true microbiology negatives, false microbiology positives, false microbiology negatives, disease (i.e., diskitis-osteomyelitis) positives as determined by reference standard, true infection positives (i.e., positive microbiology or pathology results), and total number of biopsies performed were extracted from the studies. Microbiology sensitivity, microbiology biopsy yield, and infection sensitivity were calculated from the pooled data. These terms and the data required to calculate them were also defined in detail. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS. Thirty-six articles satisfied inclusion criteria and were used for analysis. The pooled microbiology sensitivity, infection sensitivity, and microbiology biopsy yields were 46.6%, 70.0%, and 26.7%, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-only microbiology sensitivity was significantly higher than both pyogenic bacteria and mixed-organism microbiology sensitivity (p < .001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative organism (28.6%). Pooled microbiology sensitivity was not significantly different for CT guidance and fluoroscopy guidance (p = .16). There was a statistically significant difference between pooled microbiology sensitivity of bone/end plate (45.5%) and disk/paravertebral soft-tissue (64.8%) image-guided biopsies (p < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled microbiology sensitivities for patients who received antibiotics before the procedure (46.2%) and those who did not (44.6%) (p = .70). CONCLUSION. Image guidance by CT or fluoroscopy does not affect microbiology yield, disk and paravertebral soft-tissue biopsies should be considered over bone and end plate biopsies, and preprocedural antibiotic administration does not appear to impact biopsy results. CLINICAL IMPACT. Understanding and correctly applying reported statistics contribute to appropriate interpretation of the abundant literature on this topic and optimization of care for patients with diskitis-osteomyelitis.

A decision analytic model from the health care system perspective for patients with high clinical concern for multiple myeloma (MM) was used to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of three bone marrow core biopsy techniques: computed tomography (CT) guided, and fluoroscopy guided, no-imaging (landmark-based). Model input data on utilities, costs, and probabilities were obtained from comprehensive literature review and expert opinion. Costs were estimated in 2023 U.S. dollars. Primary effectiveness outcome was quality adjusted life years (QALY). Willingness to pay threshold was $100,000 per QALY gained.

Results

No-imaging based biopsy was the most cost-effective strategy as it had the highest net monetary benefit ($4218) and lowest overall cost ($92.17). Fluoroscopy guided was excluded secondary to extended dominance. CT guided biopsies were less preferred as it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($334,043) greater than the willingness to pay threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found non-imaging based biopsy to be the most cost-effective in 100% of simulations and at all willingness to pay thresholds up to $200,000.

Conclusion

No-imaging based biopsy appears to be the most cost-effective strategy for bone marrow core biopsy in patients suspected of MM.

Clinical Relevance

No imaging guidance is the preferred strategy, although image-guidance may be required for challenging anatomy. CT image interpretation may be helpful for planning biopsies. Establishing a non-imaging guided biopsy service with greater patient anxiety and pain support may be warranted.

### Analysis of nondiagnostic results after image-guided needle biopsies of musculoskeletal lesions [^aa3b862d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Rationale

Image-guided needle biopsies are commonly used to diagnose musculoskeletal tumors, but nondiagnostic (ND) results can delay diagnosis and treatment. It is important to understand which factors or diagnoses predispose to a ND result so that appropriate patient education or a possible change in the clinical plan can be made. Currently it is unclear which factors or specific lesions are more likely to lead to a ND result after image-guided needle biopsy.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore identified specific factors and diagnoses most likely to yield ND results. We also asked whether an image-guided needle biopsy of bone and soft tissue lesions is an accurate and clinically useful tool.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed data from a prospectively collected database for a case-control study of 508 image-guided needle biopsies of patients with suspected musculoskeletal tumors between 2003 and 2008.

Results

The interpretations of 453 of the 508 (89%) needle biopsies were accurate and clinically useful. Forty-five biopsies (9%) were ND and 10 (2%) were incorrect (IC). Bone lesions had a higher ND rate than soft tissue lesions (13% vs. 4%). The specific diagnosis with the highest ND rate was histiocytosis. Elbow and forearm locations had higher ND rates than average. Malignant tumors had a higher IC rate than benign tumors (5% vs. 0%); fibromyxoid sarcoma and rare subtypes of osteosarcoma had higher IC rates than other diagnoses. Repeat needle or open biopsies were performed in 71 (14%) patients. Bone lesions were more likely than soft tissue lesions to require repeat biopsies (18% vs. 9%).

Conclusions

A high rate of accuracy and clinical usefulness is possible with image-guided needle biopsies of musculoskeletal lesions. We believe these biopsies appropriate in selected circumstances but a key factor for appropriate use is an experienced musculoskeletal tumor team with frequent communication to correlate clinical, radiographic, and histologic information for each patient.

### Prostate magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in patients with a prior negative biopsy: a consensus statement by AUA and SAR [^be1bacdb]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

After an initial negative biopsy there is an ongoing need for strategies to improve patient selection for repeat biopsy as well as the diagnostic yield from repeat biopsies.

Materials and Methods

As a collaborative initiative of the AUA (American Urological Association) and SAR (Society of Abdominal Radiology) Prostate Cancer Disease Focused Panel, an expert panel of urologists and radiologists conducted a literature review and formed consensus statements regarding the role of prostate magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in patients with a negative biopsy, which are summarized in this review.

Results

The panel recognizes that many options exist for men with a previously negative biopsy. If a biopsy is recommended, prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging targeted cores appear to facilitate the detection of clinically significant disease over standardized repeat biopsy. Thus, when high quality prostate magnetic resonance imaging is available, it should be strongly considered for any patient with a prior negative biopsy who has persistent clinical suspicion for prostate cancer and who is under evaluation for a possible repeat biopsy. The decision of whether to perform magnetic resonance imaging in this setting must also take into account the results of any other biomarkers and the cost of the examination, as well as the availability of high quality prostate magnetic resonance imaging interpretation. If magnetic resonance imaging is done, it should be performed, interpreted and reported in accordance with PI-RADS version 2 (v2) guidelines. Experience of the reporting radiologist and biopsy operator are required to achieve optimal results and practices integrating prostate magnetic resonance imaging into patient care are advised to implement quality assurance programs to monitor targeted biopsy results.

Conclusions

Patients receiving a PI-RADS assessment category of 3 to 5 warrant repeat biopsy with image guided targeting. While transrectal ultrasound guided magnetic resonance imaging fusion or in-bore magnetic resonance imaging targeting may be valuable for more reliable targeting, especially for lesions that are small or in difficult locations, in the absence of such targeting technologies cognitive (visual) targeting remains a reasonable approach in skilled hands. At least 2 targeted cores should be obtained from each magnetic resonance imaging defined target. Given the number of studies showing a proportion of missed clinically significant cancers by magnetic resonance imaging targeted cores, a case specific decision must be made whether to also perform concurrent systematic sampling. However, performing solely targeted biopsy should only be considered once quality assurance efforts have validated the performance of prostate magnetic resonance imaging interpretations with results consistent with the published literature. In patients with negative or low suspicion magnetic resonance imaging (PI-RADS assessment category of 1 or 2, respectively), other ancillary markers (ie PSA, PSAD, PSAV, PCA3, PHI, 4K) may be of value in identifying patients warranting repeat systematic biopsy, although further data are needed on this topic. If a repeat biopsy is deferred on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings, then continued clinical and laboratory followup is advised and consideration should be given to incorporating repeat magnetic resonance imaging in this diagnostic surveillance regimen.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast interventional procedures [^b02a11c0]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

ACR MRI-guided breast interventional procedures — physician training and qualifications state that training in breast MRI interpretation, medical physics, and specific hands-on training in MRI-guided biopsy are imperative, and initial qualifications are as outlined in the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Breast. The physician should perform a sufficient number of procedures to maintain their skills, continued competence should depend on participation in a quality control program, and the physician's continuing education should be in accordance with the ACR Practice Parameter for Continuing Medical Education (CME). For assessment of concordance, the physician who performs the MRI-guided breast biopsy or presurgical localization procedure is responsible for obtaining histopathologic results to determine whether the finding has been adequately sampled and is concordant or discordant with imaging, provide recommendations for appropriate follow-up, and these concordance results and recommendations should be communicated to the referring physician and/or to the patient and documented in the final report. Qualified medical physicist guidance is referenced to the ACR–AAPM Technical Standard for Diagnostic Medical Physics Performance Monitoring of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging Equipment. Technologists should meet the ACR breast MRI qualifications, should participate in MRI-guided breast interventions, and should obtain continuing education in MRI-guided breast intervention. Prior to the procedure, the decision to recommend an MRI-guided breast interventional procedure should be made only after a complete imaging evaluation of the breast has been performed.

### MRI-guided breast biopsy: a review of technique, indications, and radiological-pathological correlations [^8111a3e8]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice in detection, local staging, and monitoring of breast cancer; however, breast MRI results in the detection of more indeterminate/suspicious lesions that need to be histopathologically proven to guide patient management than any other breast imaging method. If such abnormalities are not detectable in any of the conventional imaging tools (mammography (MMG) or ultrasound) then an MRI-guided biopsy needs to be performed to obtain a diagnosis. Breast MRI-guided biopsy is a time-consuming and complex procedure that requires specific equipment and experienced, well-trained staff. This review article explores and illustrates the indications, the currently available technologies, and the technique of breast MRI-guided biopsy, and explains the importance of careful imaging review and selection of cases. We correlate the radiological-pathological findings and highlight the impact on patient management in a multidisciplinary setting.

### Medical imaging in personalised medicine: a white paper of the research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^99ad6a99]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The future of medicine lies in early diagnosis and individually tailored treatments, a concept that has been designated 'personalised medicine' (PM), which aims to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Medical imaging has always been personalised and is fundamental to almost all aspects of PM. It is instrumental in solving clinical differential diagnoses. Imaging procedures are tailored to the clinical problem and patient characteristics. Screening for preclinical disease is done with imaging. Stratification based on imaging biomarkers can help identify individuals suited for preventive intervention. Treatment decisions are based on the in vivo visualisation of the location and extent of an abnormality, as well as the loco-regional physiological, biochemical and biological processes using structural and molecular imaging. Image-guided biopsy provides relevant tissue specimens for genetic/molecular characterisation. In addition, radiogenomics relate imaging biomarkers to these genetic and molecular features. Furthermore, imaging is essential to patient-tailored therapy planning, therapy monitoring and follow-up of disease, as well as targeting non-invasive or minimally invasive treatments, especially with the rise of theranostics. Radiologists need to be prepared for this new paradigm as it will mean changes in training, clinical practice and in research.

Key Points

- Medical imaging is a key component in personalised medicine

- Personalised prevention will rely on image-based screening programmes

- Anatomical, functional and molecular imaging biomarkers affect decisions on the type and intensity of treatment

- Treatment response assessment with imaging will improve personalised treatment

- Image-based invasive intervention integrates personalised diagnosis and personalised treatment

Fine-needle sampling

As mentioned before, FNS is performed almost only under US guidance. Local anaesthesia can be performed but it is not ubiquitous practice. A fine needle with diameter variable from 27 to 18 gauge (same or similar to those used for intramuscular injections) is inserted very close to the US probe and, once the needle is seen inside the target, a manual multidirectional sampling is performed, through aspiration using a 10-20-mL syringe or a vacuum aspiration system (fine - needle aspiration) or simply by manual movement of the needle inside the lesion (fine - needle capillary sampling) for about 10–20 sec. The extracted material is then spread onto slides and placed in formalin for cytological analysis. The procedure is easy, safe, and fast to perform and the associated cost is very low. When the cytopathologist is onsite during the sampling, results may be available very soon after the procedure. The success of the technique is highly dependent on the skills of the physician performing the sampling and of the cytopathologist interpreting the sample as well on their interplay. A meta-analysis published in 2008 reported on 25 studies describing FNS cytology analyses performed from 1984 to 2007 on palpable breast masses. The pooled sensitivity was 93% (range 78–100%) and the pooled specificity 98% (range 76–100%). A significant increase in diagnostic performance was shown during the years and attributed to technologic improvements. However, we should note that the report considered only FNS performed on palpable, i.e. relatively large, masses.

It is not surprising that higher rates of inadequate or false-negative results and lower accuracy rates have been reported for FNS compared to CNB. In fact, relying only on cells, FNS cytology cannot always reliably distinguish between benign tissues, high-risk/B3 lesions, DCIS, and invasive malignant changes. In many centres, the information about tumour biomarker status (especially required when a neoadjuvant treatment is under consideration) cannot be obtained from FNS. For these reasons, FNS has increasingly been replaced by CNB or VAB in the diagnosis of breast lesions. As already said, FNS cytology reliability must be considered strongly depending on local factors, i.e. on the experience of operators as well as the presence of a cytopathologist in the room during the procedure. When its performance is high, it can be used as the first fast approach, using CNB or VAB as second step, when needed.

### Image-guided percutaneous lung needle biopsy: how we do it [^4575d2f5]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Image-guided lung needle biopsy allows for minimally invasive diagnosis of lung pathology. In the setting of suspected malignancy, the biopsy not only confirms the diagnosis but also allows for molecular profiling, a requisite for tailored systemic therapy. Needle biopsy can also characterize non-neoplastic entities such as infections not responding to treatment and other inflammatory processes. A successful and safe lung needle biopsy starts with lesion and patient selection and careful pre-procedural evaluation. Here we review the indications and contraindications, diagnostic alternatives, approach planning and sequential procedural steps with the goal of maximizing both yield and patient safety. We discuss technical tips for preventing complications such as pleural anesthesia, the saline seal, the blood patch, the banana bend, hydro dissection, and the rapid needle out/patient rollover maneuver. We also review how to manage complications, avoid non-diagnostic biopsies, and provide recommendations for post-procedural observation and imaging follow-up.

### Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions [^23c435a6]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Image guidance for minimally invasive breast tissue biopsy — Image guidance for MIBT is recommended for both palpable and nonpalpable lesions to increase accuracy of sampling, and a percutaneous breast biopsy of a palpable mass without the use of image guidance may lead to a false-negative result since the biopsy device cannot be confirmed to be within the lesion of interest. In such instances, ultrasound (US) is preferred for image guidance in patients with palpable masses; imaging modalities for nonpalpable targets include breast US, mammogram (stereotactic), and magnetic resonance imaging, and if the lesion is visible sonographically, US guidance is preferred, as it optimizes patient positioning and comfort. Multiple professional organizations provide recommendations for proper image annotation, image archiving, and medical record documentation for MIBT.

Radiological considerations for liver biopsy note that image-guidance is considered the standard approach in patients with specific lesions identified by imaging, with computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) usable for guidance but US preferred because it allows real-time needle visualization, avoids exposure to ionizing radiation, and is both quicker and less expensive; guidance is particularly useful in patients with small livers that are difficult to percuss, in patients who are obese, or in patients with clinically demonstrable ascites, and real-time guidance is not only helpful for inserting the biopsy needle into a nonvascular portion of liver parenchyma but also useful for precise infiltration of the liver capsule with an anesthetic agent.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update… [^3986a235]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

The SOUND trial also excluded patients with multiple "doubtful or suspicious" lymph nodes, extensive multifocality or multicentricity, bilateral breast cancer, diagnosis of synchronous distant metastases, previous cancer, and ongoing pregnancy or lactation. In the INSEMA trial, multicentricity was not allowed but multifocal tumors were allowed and comprised approximately 3% in each group. 32, 35, 36The use of nomograms to estimate probability of SLN involvement can be especially helpful for those who are considering adjuvant systemic therapy but without access to genomic testing or for those who are also candidates for partial breast irradiation. Role of magnetic resonance imaging.

38-41Although the lower axilla can be visualized on a breast MRI, this imaging modality is often not used as the initial test for imaging the axilla in early-stage breast cancer. If performed, MRI may help confirm tumor size ≤ 2 cm and the applicability of the SOUND or INSEMA trial results. 43As in the SOUND trial, if there are no suspicious lymph nodes on preoperative MRI or only one suspicious node with a subsequent benign and concordant biopsy, then the results of the SOUND and INSEMA trials with preoperative US may be extrapolated and used in the setting of a negative breast MRI inclusive of the full axilla. In these cases, SLNB may be omitted.

24Unlike PBI, WBI incidentally treats a portion of the lower axilla due to RT fields that are tangential to the chest wall, and indeed, upon central review of the RT records of 276 patients participating in the central quality-assurance process of the INSEMA trial, 50% received at least 80% of the prescribed RT breast dose to the level I axilla, which is assumed to be curative for low-volume nodal disease. However, incidental axillary RT treatment is unlikely to have played a therapeutic role in the majority of patients enrolled on the SOUND and INSEMA trials, as 85% of patients did not have pathologically involved nodes warranting treatment. Nevertheless, subsequent analysis is planned to examine the incidental axillary irradiation doses collected from all patients enrolled on the INSEMA trial.

Post-procedural recommendations and communication of results

Following the biopsy procedure and after achieving haemostasis with manual compression, wound cleaning, and bandage, the patient is observed for 15–60 min in the radiology suite, depending on the type of procedure and the patient's profile. Subsequently, she can be discharged with appropriate instructions, including possible pain and bleeding and corresponding remedies, ban of water immersion (e.g. swimming) and strenuous exercise for at least 3–5 days following the biopsy.

Whenever possible, biopsy results as well as recommendations for further management (e.g. treatment or follow-up) should be discussed with the patient in person, usually during the visit after the biopsy. Timing of this visit must strike a balance between minimising the waiting time for the patient and its associated anxiety and the necessity to allow for enough time to have pathology results including, if necessary, additional immune-histological stains. In the cases requiring treatment, the visit after the interventional procedure should include the results from the multidisciplinary conference, at which concordance of imaging and histological findings is assessed and subsequent management is established.

Some centres have developed rapid diagnosis as " one - stop breast clinics ", providing the results of the biopsy immediately after the procedure. This type of management has been proven to be cost-effective and accurate. However, efforts should be made to decrease distress and anxiety of the patients also in this setting in regards to the quality of the patient-doctor relationship and doctors' interpersonal skills, doctors' availability, and waiting time, which are important general aspects to be improved in breast image-guided interventions.

Note G. At the end of biopsy, the patient is observed in the radiology department for 15–60 min. She can then be discharged and adequate instructions on common side effects and complications, as well as corresponding remedies are suggested. The next visit is planned for communication and discussion of the results, including the radiologist who performed the procedure and participated in the assessment of concordance between cytology/pathology diagnosis and lesion appearance at breast imaging.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast [^7c87d32a]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

Breast MRI–guided biopsy and referral logistics — If these services are not available at the facility performing breast MRI, the facility should create a referral arrangement with a cooperating facility that can provide these services. If MRI-guided breast biopsy is performed, histopathologic results should be available to the interpreting physician as well as the procedural physician. The MRI biopsy facility should have the physician expertise to determine radiologic-pathologic concordance and the ability to report management recommendations in the biopsy report. For suspicious or indeterminate findings detected on breast MRI that are occult and/or unlikely to be seen on mammography and breast ultrasound, an MRI-guided biopsy should be performed.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography-guided biopsy: principles, challenges, and opportunities [^0fa96967]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlike MRI-guided biopsy, which primarily targets the enhancing component, CEM-guided biopsy also enables correlation with anatomical cues on LE or DBT scout views, aiding localisation in cases of low conspicuity or fading enhancement. Interpretation of the available evidence is challenged by inconsistent definitions of lesion visibility and procedural success.

Procedural time for CEM-guided biopsy was documented in nine of the ten studies, with durations ranging from 5 to 33 min. Comparison between studies is complicated by differences in statistical reporting and measurement intervals. Some authors provided median times; others used mean values with standard deviations. The interval measured also varied, referencing either the time from contrast injection or first imaging acquisition to post-biopsy imaging.

Despite this heterogeneity, CEM guidance consistently took less time than MRI-guided biopsy. In one investigation, the mean duration of MRI-guided biopsy was 37.8 min (range 26–59), 24 min longer than the CEM-guided intervention, corresponding to a 63% reduction.

### Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of the liver [^82ae619d]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous Biopsy of the Liver (PBL) is a cornerstone in the diagnosis of parenchymal liver disease and focal hepatic lesions. The indications for PBL can broadly be divided into those used to garner information regarding diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment. While the diagnosis of many common liver diseases can usually be made with imaging and serologic testing alone, PBL may be indicated in situations where the diagnosis is in question. Furthermore, liver biopsies are a foundational element for personalized treatment approaches for cancer patients; increasing emphasis is being placed on acquiring sufficient tissue for molecular profiling. While a variety of image guidance and procedural techniques have been applied to PBL, following conventional principles can ensure technical success and minimize complication risks. In this technique article, we review the practical periprocedural considerations of PBL with emphasis on recent advancements and societal recommendations.

### Optimization of prostate biopsy: the role of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in detection, localization and risk assessment [^e600a352]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Optimization of prostate biopsy requires addressing the shortcomings of standard systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy, including false-negative rates, incorrect risk stratification, detection of clinically insignificant disease and the need for repeat biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging is an evolving noninvasive imaging modality that increases the accurate localization of prostate cancer at the time of biopsy, and thereby enhances clinical risk assessment and improves the ability to appropriately counsel patients regarding therapy. In this review we 1) summarize the various sequences that comprise a prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging examination along with its performance characteristics in cancer detection, localization and reporting standards; 2) evaluate potential applications of magnetic resonance imaging targeting in prostate biopsy among men with no previous biopsy, a negative previous biopsy and those with low stage cancer; and 3) describe the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy and comparative study outcomes.

Materials and Methods

A bibliographic search covering the period up to October 2013 was conducted using MEDLINE®/PubMed®. Articles were reviewed and categorized based on which of the 3 objectives of this review was addressed. Data were extracted, analyzed and summarized.

Results

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging consists of anatomical T2-weighted imaging coupled with at least 2 functional imaging techniques. It has demonstrated improved prostate cancer detection sensitivity up to 80% in the peripheral zone and 81% in the transition zone. A prostate cancer magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score has been developed, and is depicted using the Likert or PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) scale for better standardization of magnetic resonance imaging interpretation and reporting. Among men with no previous biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging increases the frequency of significant cancer detection to 50% in low risk and 71% in high risk patients. In low risk men the negative predictive value of a combination of negative magnetic resonance imaging with prostate volume parameters is nearly 98%, suggesting a potential role in avoiding biopsy and reducing over detection/overtreatment. Among men with a previous negative biopsy 72% to 87% of cancers detected by magnetic resonance imaging guidance are clinically significant. Among men with a known low risk cancer, repeat biopsy using magnetic resonance targeting demonstrates a high likelihood of confirming low risk disease in low suspicion score lesions and of upgrading in high suspicion score lesions. Techniques of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy include visual estimation transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy; software co-registered magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy; and in-bore magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy. Although the improvement in accuracy and efficiency of visual estimation biopsy compared to systematic appears limited, co-registered magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound biopsy as well as in-bore magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy appear to increase cancer detection rates in conjunction with increasing suspicion score.

Conclusions

Use of magnetic resonance imaging for targeting prostate biopsies has the potential to reduce the sampling error associated with conventional biopsy by providing better disease localization and sampling. More accurate risk stratification through improved cancer sampling may impact therapeutic decision making. Optimal clinical application of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy remains under investigation.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^33a78308]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD NAFLD practice guidance — the role and interpretation of liver biopsy notes that biopsies obtained with a 16-G needle should be at least 1.5 cm in length but preferably 2–2.5 cm in length, with good-quality sectioning and staining also important. It states that fibrosis stage is the best predictor of long-term outcome in multivariable analyses and that composite histological scores such as the NAFLD activity score (NAS) and the steatosis, activity, fibrosis score (SAF) combine features and are used in clinical studies. Biopsy remains the best method for providing information on architectural distortion and the complex anatomic interrelationships of cellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis.

### Troubleshooting to overcome technical challenges in image-guided breast biopsy [^1b75c92c]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Image-guided breast biopsy with stereotactic, ultrasonographic, or magnetic resonance imaging guidance has become an integral component of every breast imaging program. It has many advantages over open surgical biopsy, including lower cost, lower patient morbidity, faster patient recovery, and minimal to no scarring, with equal accuracy to that of open surgical biopsy. Successful completion of a breast biopsy begins with thorough preprocedural planning to choose the appropriate imaging modality and most efficient biopsy approach. Patient mental and physical comorbidities, anticoagulation status, small or thin breasts, and breast implants, as well as lesion conspicuity and posterior, superficial, axillary, or subareolar location, pose technical challenges to successful image-guided breast biopsy that must be overcome. When biopsy is performed with use of a different imaging modality than that used to initially identify the target, careful preprocedural multimodality radiologic correlation, postprocedural identification of the biopsy marker location, and radiologic-pathologic correlation must be undertaken to ensure accurate biopsy of the intended target with use of the different modality. If, after employing all available strategic and procedural modifications, image-guided breast biopsy cannot be performed, then surgical excision of the intended target should be recommended at the time of biopsy cancellation to avoid a delay in diagnosis. This article reviews patient and lesion factors that pose technical challenges to successful breast biopsy and presents strategies and procedural modifications that aid in successful completion of breast biopsy in challenging situations. © RSNA, 2017.

The majority of MRI-guided breast biopsies yield benign pathology. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of benign pathologic entities commonly encountered at MRI-guided breast biopsy.

Conclusion

Proper radiologic-pathologic correlation is an integral component of MRI-guided breast biopsy. Familiarity with the spectrum of MRI findings and key histopathologic features of common benign entities will enhance the radiologist's confidence in determining concordance and lead to improved patient management recommendations.

### To biopsy or not biopsy, that is the question-PI-RADS 3 prostate lesions-validation of clinical and radiological parameters for biopsy decision-making [^da6486e5]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PI-RADS 3 represents an intermediate risk category – most such lesions do not contain aggressive cancer, yet a meaningful minority does. This uncertainty is magnified by limitations of imaging (overlap with benign conditions and reader variability) that make it difficult to confidently distinguish which PI-RADS 3 lesions are dangerous. As a result, management must be carefully individualized. Clinicians employ adjunctive measures like PSA density, clinical risk factors, and sometimes repeat imaging to stratify the likelihood of cancer. The decision of whether to proceed with biopsy or to monitor must balance the risk of missing a significant cancer against the downsides of unnecessary biopsy. In essence, the PI-RADS 3 dilemma exemplifies the broader challenge in prostate cancer early detection: how to avoid both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Ongoing research – including advanced imaging techniques, biomarkers and the use of artificial intelligence – is aimed at improving risk discrimination in this equivocal group.

Until then, the management of PI-RADS 3 will remain a clinical gray zone requiring expert judgment, patient counseling, and often a tailored combination of surveillance and targeted intervention.

### Prostate cancer: state of the art imaging and focal treatment [^49168f32]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, it is estimated 180,890 men are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 3,306,760 men live with prostate cancer in the United States. The introduction of multiparametric (mp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, standardised interpretation guidelines such as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS version 2), and MRI-based targeted biopsy has improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Accurate risk stratification (Gleason grade/score and tumour stage) using imaging and image-guided targeted biopsy has become critical for the management of patients with prostate cancer. Recent advances in MRI-guided minimally invasive ablative treatment (MIAT) utilising cryoablation, laser ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, have allowed accurate focal or regional delivery of optimal thermal energy to the biopsy proven, MRI-detected tumour, under real-time or near simultaneous MRI monitoring of the ablation zone. A contemporary review on prostate mpMRI, MRI-based targeted biopsy, and MRI-guided ablation techniques is presented.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast interventional procedures [^21e1a6bc]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

ACR MRI-guided breast interventions — facility capabilities and quality management: Facilities performing breast MRI should have the ability to perform correlation with mammography, MRI-directed breast US, and MRI-guided interventions, and if MRI-guided biopsy is not offered, a referral arrangement should be established with a cooperating facility to provide these services without repeating the MRI. Because breast MRI protocols can vary considerably between facilities, agreements require compatible breast MRI protocols and technical factors; without compatible protocols, MRI examinations may need to be repeated prior to biopsy, creating unnecessary duplication, costs, and inconvenience. Radiologists who interpret breast MRI without performing biopsies should make every attempt to follow up on biopsy recommendations to audit programs, and successful performance relies on high-quality imaging, expertise in interpretation, and appropriate patient selection. Imaging findings and pathology results should be correlated for concordance by the physician performing the biopsy, and records should document results and management recommendations.

### Surgical pathology reports-NCI-national cancer institute… [^d2fb5fb6]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

For some cancer types, especially breast cancer and melanoma, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes, called the sentinel lymph nodes, so the pathologist can see if these contain cancer cells. The Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy fact sheet describes this procedure and its use in determining the extent, or stage, of cancer in the body. Once processed, the tissue is embedded into a permanent paraffin wax block to be cut. The paraffin-embedded tissue is then sliced into very thin sections that are placed onto microscopic slides. The slides are stained with dyes to help visualize parts of the cell and structures in the tissue. This is known as histologic examination. With H&E staining, hematoxylin shows the ribosomes, chromatin within the nucleus, and some other structures in the nucleus as a deep blue-purple color. Eosin shows the cytoplasm, collagen, connective tissue, and other structures that surround and support the cell as an orange-pink-red color.

The microscopic description section will also indicate whether abnormal cells are found in the margins or in lymph nodes. Margins are described as negative when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has been removed. A margin is described as positive when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that some of the cancer has not been removed. Lymph nodes are called positive if they have cancer cells and negative if they do not.
- investigate genetic or molecular abnormalities in specimens with the use of specific techniques.

These include karyotyping, to detect aneuploidy and large translocations, as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization, to detect specific chromosomal deletions or translocations. A liquid biopsy — in which a sample of blood or other body fluid is tested to look for pieces of DNA that have been released from tumor cells — is another way that the molecular characteristics of a tumor may be analyzed. The findings of these additional tests may be provided in separate reports that are linked to the pathology report. Pathology examination is increasingly incorporating analyses of the structure and sequence of DNA extracted from fresh and fixed tissue samples to refine the cancer diagnosis through improved subtyping and stratification of tumor types and to better inform treatment.

### The difficult biopsy: let's make it easier [^3a5ebf93]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Image-guided percutaneous biopsies of abdominal and pelvic organs are an integral part of the daily practice of many radiologists. Fortunately, most image-guided percutaneous biopsies are straightforward. At times, however, image-guided percutaneous biopsies can be technically challenging due to various factors, including proximity of surrounding vessels or organs, "moving targets" due to respiratory motion, or difficulties in detecting lesions with certain imaging modalities. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss techniques that can be utilized to increase the successful biopsy of "difficult" lesions. Choices of imaging modality for guiding needle placement will be discussed, as will the use of alternative access routes such as transgluteal, transvaginal, and other transorgan approaches. Factors to improve the accessibility of lesions, including patient positioning and the timing of contrast injections that improve lesion detection, will be discussed.

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^c8a6e705]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

PET/CT data analysis underscores the importance for interventional radiologists to remain cautious of potential false-positive findings, including non-malignant FDG uptake and imaging artifacts. For further research, prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed, as well as a standardized protocol for PET/CT data.

The findings of the present study suggest that taking fewer than three biopsy samples may compromise diagnostic accuracy and that the amount of tissue obtained for histopathological evaluation remains crucial, even in cases of high PET-scan uptake. Moreover, biopsy site selection should not be solely based on the most metabolically active lesion, as each clinical scenario presents distinct challenges for the interventional radiologist. While minimal sampling helps to streamline procedures, it remains essential to ensure the quantity of the material collected. Striking a balance between procedural efficiency and diagnostic reliability is key to optimizing bone biopsy practice.

### Virtual biopsy: just an AI software or a medical procedure? [^a5620301]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The term virtual biopsy is gaining traction. Since 2015, the number of publications referencing the concept in the search engine PubMed has doubled, and in 2021 it reached its highest level yet. This raises the question of what the unique characteristics of a virtual biopsy are and how it might be distinguished from other advances in computer-assisted medicine. For optimists, it may be the next step toward a less invasive, more personalized era in medicine that harnesses recent advances in functional imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to generate patient management decisions. For skeptics, the term may ring hollow, like yet another marketing phrase within the hype surrounding AI in the medical field. Ultimately, the juxtaposition of virtual and biopsy contains within it not merely the possibility of adding another tool to the physician's toolbox but the aspiration that the biopsy, a crucial procedure in the diagnosis of disease, may be transformed from physical to virtual while still providing diagnostic and prognostic information at least at the level of a traditional, physical biopsy, serving as reference standard. We assess the current state of this aspiration and conclude that although hurdles remain, the virtual biopsy is poised to replace the physical biopsy as a central step in the diagnosis and management of certain diseases.

### Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions [^e532b2fb]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Use of minimally invasive biopsy techniques (MIBT) — the goals are to provide an accurate pre-operative diagnosis of malignant or pre-malignant breast lesions and to avoid an open surgical procedure for patients with benign abnormalities; using MIBT to establish a cancer diagnosis before any surgical procedure is considered a Breast Quality Measure; a preoperative diagnosis allows for consideration of additional breast imaging before initial therapy, optimizes decision-making for the surgical approach, and maintains patient eligibility for neoadjuvant systemic therapy; consultations for fertility, plastic surgery, and genetic testing can be obtained before the definitive surgical excision; a preoperative diagnosis also optimizes oncologic and cosmetic surgical planning and facilitates preoperative axillary staging to minimize the number of surgical interventions; when a cancer diagnosis has been made preoperatively, surgery can more often be performed as a single procedure with clear margins, resulting in improved efficiency of care.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography-guided biopsy: principles, challenges, and opportunities [^a96c226a]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Specimen imaging and post-procedure assessment

The visualisation of iodine in CEM biopsy specimens has been proposed as a method to confirm lesion sampling. A single study found increased attenuation in low-energy radiographs of biopsy samples, interpreted as iodine retention. This assumption is questioned by methodological shortcomings, such as using contrast drops in a petri dish, which are not representative of in vivo concentrations. Moreover, no histopathological or immunohistochemical confirmation of iodine presence has been provided. The observed attenuation differences in specimen images more likely reflect variations in tissue thickness or composition than true iodine content.

In current practice, immediate specimen evaluation is not performed during CEM-guided biopsy, similar to MRI guidance. Instead, post-procedure imaging is used to assess clip placement and haematoma location, ensuring sampling accuracy and excluding complications.

The optimal modality for post-procedural imaging remains undefined. Most institutions rely on standard two-view mammography or DBT. Post-procedural CEM using the same contrast bolus has demonstrated persistent enhancement in 68% of incompletely removed lesions, approximately 34 min after injection in a single-centre study. However, this approach remains controversial, as post-sampling changes, haematoma formation, and increasing BPE can all reduce lesion conspicuity. Further studies are warranted to define the optimal imaging protocol and clarify the diagnostic value of post-procedural CEM.

### Comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy alone for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^66c90949]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

An important limitation of the included RCTs was that each study used a different definition of csPCa, and it was not possible to extract sufficient data for a standardized definition. This may explain the high degree of heterogeneity among studies, which means that results should be interpreted with some caution. Another source of variation was the guidance method used during the biopsy procedure itself. Cognitive guidance is potentially more error prone than MRI-ultrasonography image fusion guidance, and the 2 RCTs, using cognitive guidance missed the highest percentage of csPCa. Only 1 RCTreported data on complications associated with biopsy; therefore, we have very limited data for this important outcome. None of the RCTs reported long-term follow-up data to capture screening-relevant outcomes, such as time to mortality or cancer-associated mortality.

There have been concerns about the financial costs of MRI, but these have reduced over time, and 2 recent studies, based on US and UK data have demonstrated that incorporating MRI can be cost-effective, especially because doing so may avoid some unnecessary biopsies and reduce the burden of overtreatment. Another concern has been the availability of the necessary expertise to interpret MRI scans and perform MRI-guided biopsies. Training is necessary for radiographers to perform high-quality mpMRI scans and for radiologists and urologists to interpret the images and perform targeted biopsies. Standardized reporting has reduced variation in the interpretation of MRI scans among radiologists, but this variation is still significant. Inaccurate sampling has been identified as a contributor to reduced MRI performance, even in those individuals undergoing MRI-ultrasonography fusion prostate biopsy.

Concordance assessment after MIBT — High success rates for pathologic and imaging concordance by MIBT are achievable, with multiple reports demonstrating a success rate of 90% or greater. After MIBT, care providers must perform imaging-histology concordance assessment to determine whether the pathology obtained correlates with the imaged target and avoid false negative biopsies, and concordance of clinical breast examination, imaging, and the biopsy results must always be determined and documented. Discordant biopsy results are an indication to either repeat a percutaneous biopsy or to proceed directly to surgical excision.

Spontaneous regression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare but well-described clinical phenomenon; spontaneous regression of nonmetastatic RCC has been reported far less frequently. We present three cases of primary RCC that regressed spontaneously following the image-guided biopsy that established their diagnosis. We briefly review the literature describing spontaneous regression of both primary and metastatic RCC and emphasize how knowledge of this phenomenon may be useful for abdominal imagers that perform renal biopsy or interpret postbiopsy follow-up studies.

### Molecular breast imaging: use of a dual-head dedicated gamma camera to detect small breast tumors [^dc0f8553]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Medium credibility.

Molecular breast imaging (MBI) final assessment and management — Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS)–parallel categories — states that the final assessment and management recommendations should be provided on every MBI examination. Categories are described as Category 0 (Incomplete, needs additional imaging), Category 1 (negative, routine follow-up), Category 2 (benign, routine follow-up), Category 3 (very low likelihood of malignancy), Category 4 (Suspicious, consider biopsy), Category 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy, take appropriate action), and Category 6 (known malignancy, take appropriate action). The assessment is based on the level of suspicion by the interpreting radiologist based on lesion distribution, intensity, and morphology. When a final assessment of 1 or 2 is given, no further imaging is necessary, and Category 0 should be avoided, similar to breast MRI interpretation, with an assessment corresponding to the level of suspicion provided when possible. All category 0, 3, 4, or 5 lesions undergo diagnostic mammography and/or ultrasound; if a correlate is identified on mammography or ultrasound, biopsy can be performed with guidance from one of those modalities. If no correlate is identified on conventional imaging for a category 3 finding, short-interval follow-up MBI, typically in 6 months, is recommended; if the lesion decreases in size and/or intensity on follow-up, it is considered benign; if it increases in size and/or intensity, MRI or MBI guided biopsy is performed; if it remains the same, continued follow-up at 12 and 24 months after the initial MBI is recommended.

### Radiologic-pathologic correlation at breast MR imaging: what is the appropriate management for high-risk lesions? [^f5f023b8]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is increasingly performed for a variety of indications, most commonly with the goal of detecting breast cancer. Percutaneous biopsy (usually under MR guidance or ultrasound if there is a correlating finding) is commonly used to evaluate suspicious imaging findings detected on MR imaging with the goal of identifying malignancy. It is important to be familiar with the characteristics and management of high-risk lesions detected or biopsied under MR guidance. This review focuses on the appearance of a variety of breast lesions detected on MR imaging that require excision with focus on pathologic correlation.

### MR imaging-guided breast interventions: indications, key principles, and imaging-pathology correlation [^45b29889]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

MR imaging is now routinely performed for breast cancer screening and staging. For suspicious MR imaging-detected lesions that are mammographically and sonographically occult, MR imaging-guided breast interventions, including biopsy, clip placement, and preoperative needle localization, have been developed to permit accurate tissue diagnosis and aid in surgical planning. These procedures are safe, accurate, and effective when performed according to key principles, including proper patient selection, use of appropriate technique, adequate preprocedure preparation and postprocedure patient care, and postprocedure imaging-pathology correlation. Imaging-pathology correlation after MR imaging-guided biopsy is essential to confirm accurate sampling and guide development of a comprehensive management plan.

Molecular breast imaging (MBI) — clinical utility and patient considerations note that results from MBI have been shown useful for detection and monitoring of breast cancer, particularly in settings where conventional modalities of mammography and ultrasound are considered insufficient or where breast MRI is recommended but not feasible, and because MBI provides information on the functional behavior of tumors, it can reveal breast cancers masked by dense fibroglandular tissue on mammography. MBI is well-tolerated by patients, has few contraindications, is associated with low costs, and has a fast interpretation learning curve, and MBI also offers the option for MBI-guided biopsy.

### Concordance assessment of pathology results with imaging findings after image-guided biopsy [^2aebc992]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the impact of radiology review for discordance between pathology results from computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies versus imaging findings performed before a biopsy.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective review, which is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and approved by the institutional review board, 926 consecutive CT-guided biopsies performed between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. In total, 453 patients were presented in radiology review meetings (prospective group), and the results were classified as concordant or discordant. Results from the remaining 473 patients not presented at the radiology review meetings were retrospectively classified. Times to reintervention and to definitive diagnosis were obtained for discordant cases; of these, 49 (11%) of the 453 patients were in the prospective group and 55 (12%) of the 473 patients in the retrospective group.

Results

Pathology results from CT-guided biopsies were discordant with imaging in 11% (104/926) of the cases, with 57% (59/104) of these cases proving to be malignant. In discordant cases, reintervention with biopsy and surgery yielded a shorter time to definitive diagnosis (28 and 14 days, respectively) than an imaging follow-up (78 days) (P < .001). The median time to diagnosis was 41 days in the prospective group and 56 days in the retrospective group (P = 0.46). When radiologists evaluated the concordance between pathology and imaging findings and recommended a repeat biopsy for the discordant cases, more biopsies were performed (50% [11/22] vs 13% [4/31]; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

Eleven percent of CT-guided biopsies yielded pathology results that were discordant with imaging findings, with 57% of these proving to be malignant on further workup.

### Developments in ultrasound-based imaging for prostate cancer detection [^faf06711]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

A diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is made following a core needle biopsy performed under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. Unfortunately, TRUS reveals suspicious prostate lesions in less than half of cases because PCa often appears isoechoic on standard B‐mode ultrasound images. Traditional biopsy methods have therefore required regularly spaced sampling from specific zones throughout the prostate. Due to this blind sampling technique, a negative result is not necessarily indicative of a lack of PCa because a cancerous lesion could be present but was not sampled by the biopsy. In fact, the false negative rate of a systematic 12‐core prostate systematic template biopsy is over 30%, and PCa goes undetected at initial biopsy in 18%–41% of cases. This major gap in PCa diagnosis has led to considerable interest in new biomarkers and accessible imaging methods to better identify regions suspicious for harboring PCa that can be biopsied in a targeted fashion.

PCa is frequently visible on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), which has evolved as the current gold standard for PCa imaging and has been incorporated into current biopsy regimens. In a multi‐center trial patients were randomized to proceed to a standard systematic biopsy or to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by targeted biopsy if a suspicious lesion was seen on MRI. This study found that mpMRI‐guided biopsy was superior to standard TRUS‐guided biopsy. These findings have been validated in other trials, and prebiopsy MRI has become a global standard of care where accessible.

However, there are still some limitations with using mpMRI for PCa detection. One of these is the difficult learning curve in the interpretation of mpMRI, meaning that there is a high degree of interobserver variability in the interpretation of mpMRI and the urologists performing the biopsy procedure are often not experts at reading the MRI images. Interobserver variability impacts clinical care by influencing who is referred for prostate biopsy. Other limitations include the considerable cost and lack of universal access to mpMRI imaging, and inaccuracies that arise in image fusion, known as registration error. Additionally, clinically significant PCa is invisible on mpMRI in an estimated 6‐15% of cases

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^02562fbd]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study addresses an underexplored topic in the literature and provides relevant findings regarding the consideration of lesion metabolism in the performance of IGBB. Current recommendations suggest obtaining at least three biopsy samples and emphasize the importance of selecting a site with the lowest procedural risk. Our results indicate that, even in highly metabolic lesions, PET/CT alone does not allow for a reduction in the number of samples without compromising diagnostic performance. However, PET/CT remains the tool of choice for assessing disease extent and is a valuable aid in biopsy site selection. This has significant implications for musculoskeletal interventional radiologists in daily practice.

### Does three-dimensional functional infrared imaging improve breast cancer detection based on digital mammography in women with dense breasts? [^69c5f7f8]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Image interpretation

All images were interpreted in conjunction with clinical history and, when available, prior imaging. Radiologists were blinded to 3DIRI results when evaluating the mammograms, but aware of positive 3DIRI risk score when assessing MRI examinations.

Assessments were made in accordance with the national 5-point classification scale (same as the British Royal College of Radiologists Breast Group imaging classification) where 1 is normal, 2 is benign, 3 is intermediate/probably benign finding, 4 is findings suspicious of malignancy, and 5 is findings highly suspicious of malignancy. Images classified 1–2 were considered negative and images classified 3–5 were considered positive and required further workup.

For mammography, 5 radiologists with 6–30 years of experience were responsible for evaluation of screening mammograms. Two radiologists read each mammogram. For MRI, 3 radiologists with 3–8 years of experience in mammography/ultrasound and 0–2 years of experience in DCE-MRI were responsible for evaluation. Each MRI examination was read by 2 radiologists. When an agreement could not be reached, a radiologist with 7 years of breast MRI experience was consulted and a consensus reached. The American College of Radiology breast imaging reporting and data system (BIRADS) lexicon 5th edition was used for MRI image interpretation and reporting, but assessments were given according to the 5-point scale described above.

Verification

All women with positive mammograms underwent standard workup with complimentary image acquisition and ultrasound. All positive findings were verified by needle biopsy guided by either ultrasound or stereotactic technique.

All women with a negative mammogram and positive 3DIRI were further examined by MRI (in three cases where MRI could not be performed because of patient anxiety, ultrasound was performed). MRI was considered the imaging gold standard. Women with positive MRIs underwent further mammographic and ultrasonic workup and biopsy. If the finding could not be visualized by these methods, MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed. Histopathology reports were retrieved to verify the diagnosis of breast cancer.

All women were followed up in the National Breast Cancer Registry to identify a diagnosis of breast cancer during a period of at least 17 months subsequent to the initial examination. Women underwent the initial examination between November 2015 and June 2016 and were followed up in the national registry until 31 October 2017.

### Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams [^fe4902be]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Next, we refined exams with biopsy-proven benign findings to determine if the pathology results were deemed by the radiologist to be concordant or discordant with the imaging features of the breast lesion. Patients with biopsy reports that confirmed a discordant benign finding were only included in the test set if they received a subsequent biopsy (that was not discordant) or breast surgery within the 6 months following the initial discordant biopsy. Patients with benign discordant biopsies that did not receive subsequent pathological evaluation were excluded.

Lastly, we ensured that exams with pathology-proven cancers contained images of these cancers. Since breast US produces small images which do not comprehensively capture the entire breast, a proportion of patients diagnosed with breast cancer did not have images of the cancer in any of their US images. US exams with a label indicating malignancy and a BI-RADS score of 1–2 were excluded as these exams typically did not contain images of the cancer. Additionally, patients diagnosed with breast cancer who did not have any breast pathology obtained using US-guided biopsy were also excluded, since the majority of patients diagnosed using MRI and stereotactic-guided biopsies had malignancies that were sonographically occult. US exams that received a BI-RADS score of 0, 3, and 6, as well as patients who had breast pathology obtained using multi-modal image guidance (US plus stereotactic and/or MRI guided biopsies) had their cases manually reviewed to confirm that breast cancer was visible on the US exam. Patients who were given a BI-RADS score of 4–5 and had all their breast pathology obtained using US-guided biopsy were presumed to have visible cancers and were not manually reviewed.

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^c8d12f10]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

However, obtaining high-quality samples can be challenging, as lesion characteristics such as location, size, and density may present technical challenges. Consequently, failing to optimize sample collection or selecting a suboptimal biopsy site can lead to diagnostic errors or inconclusive results, thereby increasing the need for repeat biopsies. In clinical practice, biopsy procedures often require a trade-off between various factors, such as diagnostic performance, procedural safety, and patient comfort. The goal is to achieve the best possible balance, ensuring sufficient tissue sampling while minimizing risks, including radiation exposure, procedural duration, and patient discomfort. Optimizing biopsy techniques, particularly determining the minimum number of samples required to achieve optimal diagnostic performance, remains a key issue in interventional radiology. Moreover, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-based guidance has been associated with enhanced diagnostic performance. FDG uptake is theoretically correlated with the proportion of active tumor cells, suggesting that targeting areas with high uptake could increase the likelihood of obtaining a diagnostic biopsy. Given that a significant number of patients undergo PET/CT as part of their clinical management, the metabolic characteristics of biopsied lesions may improve procedural efficiency and reduce the number of required samples. This could also impact the selection of the biopsy site in cases of multiple suspicious lesions, potentially prioritizing a metabolically active but technically challenging lesion over a more accessible but less active one. To our knowledge, the influence of metabolism on biopsy samples needed has never been studied.

The primary objective was to evaluate whether performing bone biopsies in a more hypermetabolic area would result in a diagnosis with fewer samples. The second objective was to identify additional predictive factors for optimizing biopsies targeting suspicious bone lesions.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast interventional procedures [^b8673404]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

ACR MRI-guided breast interventions — indications and role of targeted ultrasound (US): MRI-guided breast intervention is suitable for many MRI-depicted suspicious abnormalities, and it is common to initially evaluate MRI-detected findings with targeted US because US-guided biopsy has advantages over MRI-guided biopsy in cost, time, and comfort. Certain findings, such as nonmass enhancement, are less likely to be seen on US; it may be appropriate to proceed directly to MRI-guided biopsy when US is unlikely to identify a correlate, and MRI-guided biopsy may also be indicated after targeted US if the US finding cannot be confidently correlated to the MRI finding. Some practices perform a limited MRI after the US-guided biopsy to confirm biopsy of the MRI finding. Indications include lesions only seen on MRI or lacking definite correlate on mammography or US when the BI-RADS assessment category is either suspicious (BI-RADS Category 4) or highly suggestive of malignancy (BI-RADS Category 5), and even if the probability of malignancy is very high, percutaneous biopsy is indicated both to confirm diagnosis and to obtain tissue for molecular profiling to guide treatment. Lesions only seen on MRI or lacking definite correlate with a BI-RADS assessment category that is probably benign (BI-RADS Category 3) are included only when there are valid clinical indications or when short-term-interval follow-up would be difficult or impractical, and indications also include repeat biopsy.

### Reducing false negatives in biopsy of suspicious MRI findings [^bc85e324]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI is a highly sensitive imaging modality that often detects findings that are occult on mammography and US. Given the overlap in appearance of benign and malignant lesions, an accurate method of tissue sampling for MRI-detected findings is essential. Although MRI-directed US and correlation with mammography can be helpful for some lesions, a correlate is not always found. MRI-guided biopsy is a safe and effective method of tissue sampling for findings seen only on MRI. The unique limitations of this technique, however, contribute to false negatives, which can result in delays in diagnosis and adverse patient outcomes; this is of particular importance as most MRI examinations are performed in the high-risk or preoperative setting. Here, we review strategies to minimize false negatives in biopsy of suspicious MRI findings, including appropriate selection of biopsy modality, use of meticulous MRI-guided biopsy technique, management after target nonvisualization, assessment of adequate lesion sampling, and determination of radiology-pathology concordance. A proposed management algorithm for MRI-guided biopsy results will also be discussed.

### Percutaneous biopsy from blinded to MR guided: an update on current techniques and applications [^a2bf0eae]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The advent of interventional MR imaging techniques as well as their adoption to guide percutaneous biopsies and aspirations has served as a further step along a series of technical refinements that commenced with the implementation of image-guided approaches for tissue sampling. Nowadays, the practice of and the expectations from these procedures are quite different from those of the blind percutaneous thrusts performed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As the field of interventional MR imaging continues to flourish and to attract more radiologists who realize the many opportunities that this technology can offer to their patients, there is a need for a full comprehension of the concepts, techniques, limitations, and cost-effectiveness of MR imaging guidance to present this service to clinical partners in the appropriate setting. Radiologists should also recognize the need for their significant involvement in the technical aspects of MR-guided procedures, because several user-defined parameters and trajectory decisions can alter device visualization in the MR imaging environment and hence affect procedure safety.

### Role of image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy in the age of precision medicine [^408a08d4]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With the remarkable progress in cancer precision medicine, the demand for biopsy has been increasing, and the role of biopsy has been changing. In this review, we discuss the current state and recent advances in the role of image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy (PNB) in facilitating precision medicine.

Recent Findings

Biopsies are useful not only in the diagnosis of cancer and histological sub-type but also in the analysis of its molecular characteristics for targeted treatments. PNB specimens have been shown to provide high DNA yields for genomic analysis. Liquid biopsy is an emerging technology but is under development; therefore, PNB is the current standard of practice and is performed complimentarily with liquid biopsy. In the age of precision medicine, interventional oncologists play a key role in optimal tissue collection for adequate genomic analysis. Effective PNB may improve its diagnostic utility and help optimize precision medicine.

### To biopsy or not biopsy, that is the question-PI-RADS 3 prostate lesions-validation of clinical and radiological parameters for biopsy decision-making [^e6d1afc4]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact on clinical decision-making

The indeterminate nature of PI-RADS 3 directly translates into a clinical management dilemma: should a PI-RADS 3 lesion prompt an immediate biopsy, or can the patient be safely observed?

This question is challenging because of the trade-offs involved:

The clinical management of PI-RADS 3 lesions is challenging due to the balance between avoiding unnecessary interventions and not missing csPCa. Biopsying all PI-RADS 3 lesions would expose many patients to invasive procedures despite a high rate of non-significant findings — over 80% of these lesions may not yield csPCa. Biopsies carry risks such as bleeding, infection, and sepsis increase healthcare costs, and cause anxiety. Detecting insignificant cancer (Gleason 3 + 3) may lead to overtreatment. Thus, routinely biopsying all PI-RADS 3 lesions risks over-diagnosis and patient harm and should be avoided when possible. On the other hand, deferring biopsy carries a measurable, though relatively low, risk of missing csPCa. Approximately 10–20% of PI-RADS 3 lesions do contain clinically significant cancer, and delayed diagnosis can be serious — especially in patients with additional risk factors such as rising PSA or family history. Clinicians must weigh the harms of missed cancer against those of unnecessary procedures, making management complex and controversial. Recent evidence supports a more individualized approach. Risk stratification using clinical and biochemical markers is increasingly used to guide biopsy decisions. Among these, PSA density (PSAD) has proven particularly valuable. A PSAD < 0.15 ng/mL/cc indicates low risk for csPCa, while higher values suggest greater risk. A meta-analysis showed that this threshold safely reduces unnecessary biopsies while maintaining high sensitivity (95–97%). In line with this, Barrett et al. highlight that the clinical value of mpMRI depends not only on technical standards, but also on consistent patient preparation, structured reporting, and multidisciplinary collaboration. They recommend the systematic use of quality assessment tools, regular audits, and feedback mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and maximize patient benefit.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) [^c1f068a7]. ACR (2023). High credibility.

Quality control, safety, infection control, patient education, and auditing for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) — policies and procedures should be developed and implemented in accordance with the ACR Policy on Quality Control and Improvement, Safety, Infection Control, and Patient Education. Examinations should be systematically reviewed and evaluated as part of the facility's quality improvement program, with monitoring that includes evaluation of the accuracy of interpretation and the appropriateness of examinations. Complications and adverse events or activities that may have the potential for sentinel events must be monitored, analyzed, reported, and periodically reviewed, and data should be collected to comply with statutory and regulatory peer‑review procedures to ensure confidentiality. In accordance with standards of 2-D DM imaging, each facility should establish and maintain a medical outcome audit program to follow up positive assessments and to correlate pathology results with the interpreting physician's findings; if a facility does not perform DBT-guided intervention and refers tomosynthesis-only findings for biopsy to another accredited facility, it should have access to correlative pathology results from the procedure facility. The audit should assess the accuracy of interpretation as well as the clinical appropriateness of the examination; facilities should use the BI-RADS final assessment codes and terminology for reporting and tracking outcomes; the BI-RADS Atlas contains guidance on monitoring outcomes and conducting the audit; and summary statistics and comparisons for each physician and each facility should be reviewed annually by the lead interpreting physician.

### Urology resident experience with an elective in interventional radiology: a pilot evaluation [^5b743d51]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of the study was to evaluate the initial experience with an elective in interventional uroradiology.

Methods

Seven urology residents completed a minimum 2-month elective in interventional radiology (IR). A survey was administered before and immediately after the elective. The survey sought information on proficiency in uroradiology procedures and the role of IR in current training and future practice based on a 5-point ascending Likert response scale. Procedures performed during the elective were reviewed and recorded from the resident case logs.

Results

Urology residents reported an increased proficiency in all interventional procedures after the IR rotation. Endovascular techniques, ablative therapies, and needle biopsy had significant increases in performance proficiency (P = 0.031). On completion, residents strongly agreed that interventional uroradiology should be a part of residency training, and image-guided therapies will play a significant role in the future of urology. Residents performed on average 14.9 arterial interventions, 28.5 venous interventions, 15.8 genitourinary interventions, and 3.1 tumor ablations per month. In addition, urology residents performed image-guided biopsies, drainages, as well as gastrointestinal and biliary interventions gaining experience with performing and interpreting ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, and CT.

Conclusion

Interventional uroradiology provides urology residents invaluable experience with image-guided procedures, increasing comfort with performance and interpretation. Residents believed that interventional uroradiology should be incorporated into the residency curriculum.

### Breast biopsies under magnetic resonance imaging guidance: challenges of an essential but imperfect technique [^ffaf09cc]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided breast biopsy is an essential tool of a breast imager; yet, a decade after its introduction, this technique remains challenging and imperfect. This article presents the technique of MRI-guided biopsy, with an emphasis on challenges particular to the technique: technical considerations related to adequate lesion sampling and difficulties in confirming radiologic-pathologic correlation for enhancing lesions. Through clinical vignettes, challenges unique to MRI-guided biopsy are discussed and practical tips are offered. Prebiopsy planning including second-look targeted studies, patient preparation, and equipment is covered. Challenging situations pertaining to breast size, lesion location, or type of enhancement are illustrated, as well as the topic of performing multiple MRI-guided breast biopsies in a single session and biopsies of women with implants. Postbiopsy management is discussed. Success of MRI-guided biopsies requires careful prebiopsy planning, as well as appropriate choice of biopsy device, optimized for the specifics of breast shape and lesion size and location. Special features of biopsy systems (smaller apertures and blunt tips) facilitate the sampling of lesions in challenging locations. Vanishing lesions should undergo short-term follow-up, because malignancy cannot be excluded, as should lesions diagnosed as benign after pathologic analysis when the result is felt to be concordant with imaging features. To this end, radiologic-pathologic correlation is essential. Underestimation rates after MRI-guided breast biopsy are superior to those for vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsy and ultrasound-guided biopsy. Close follow-up and rebiopsy should be considered when there is imaging-discordant histology. For benign and concordant histology, a first follow-up can be offered at 6 months.

### UK guidelines for the management of bone sarcomas [^c40b8ece]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Image-guided core needle biopsy is safe and has a high diagnostic yield for Ewing sarcoma but is less accurate in identifying the grade of chondral tumours. Assessing the grade of chondrosarcomas is difficult and opinions often vary. Diagnosis of chondrosarcoma requires discussion in a bone sarcoma MDT.

CT-guided biopsies may be better for deeper locations (e.g. pelvis) or to target a particular area within a tumour (e.g. a dedifferentiated area in a chondrosarcoma). Frozen sections can confirm lesional tissue is present but are unreliable for definitive diagnosis and consume diagnostic material. Biopsy tracks should be clearly marked with a small incision or tattoo to guide later excision.

Biopsy of possible metastases, including locoregional lymph node spread, should be considered before treatment starts if management might change as a result (e.g. trial entry, decision to amputate or inclusion in the radiation field).

'Liquid biopsies' investigating circulating free (cf) or circulating tumour (ct) DNA are emerging as possible diagnostic tools. Exploratory studies have shown that cfDNA can be discriminated between sarcoma and non-sarcoma patients, and between Ewing and non-Ewing sarcomas, and serial ctDNA tests may reflect response and relapse in Ewing sarcoma, but these do not replace histological diagnosis.

Laminectomy or decompression for potential spinal PMBTs should be avoided at diagnosis unless necessary for emergency relief of spinal cord compression (SCC) and only after consultation with a member of a bone sarcoma MDT. Some patients with impending or symptomatic SCC remain neurologically stable with non-surgical treatment granting time for histological diagnosis to be obtained and definitive management to be planned at a bone sarcoma centre. Emergency intralesional decompression usually prevents later complete removal of a PMBT.

### Expect the unexpected: investigating discordant prostate MRI and biopsy results [^f87011c7]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, pre-biopsy prostate MRI has increasingly gained recognition as the most accurate imaging modality to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and is now considered the standard of care. Indeed, randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that MRI detects more csPCa compared to systematic transrectal biopsy alone while concurrently reducing both the number of biopsies performed and the detection rate of indolent disease. The success of MRI is at least partly due to efforts towards standardisation of image acquisition, interpretation, and reporting, derived from the PI-RADS guidelines. This system enables the detection, localisation, and classification of MRI findings to estimate the likelihood of csPCa and plan for targeted biopsies.

Importantly, MRI offers a high negative predictive value, with recent meta-analyses reporting PCa detection rates as low as 4% in low-probability PI-RADS scores 1 and 2; however, its positive predictive value is more variable at only 69–75% for PI-RADS 5 lesions. Clinically, the accuracy of prostate MRI depends on many factors, including image quality and radiologist experience. Additionally, several benign conditions are known to mimic csPCa, such as granulomatous prostatitis and chronic inflammation. Simultaneously, biopsy targeting errors due to operator inexperience or suboptimal image fusion may account for some "false-positive" MRI results. Finally, diagnostic outcomes also depend on accurate subspecialist histopathology interpretation.

Thus, a high-quality csPCa diagnostic pathway relies on optimal MRI performance and reporting, accurate biopsy targeting, and specialist pathological interpretation, with discrepant results not always attributable to MRI. The aim of the present study was to evaluate discordant radio-pathological outcomes in biopsy naïve patients undergoing prostate mpMRI in a tertiary referral centre to provide insights on the reasons behind the diagnostic errors and how to address these limitations within the csPCa diagnostic pathway.

### Diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography / computed tomography-driven biopsy for the diagnosis of lymphoma [^eaab337c]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Safe and timely biopsy is a prerequisite for optimal lymphoma and cancer care in general, and a moderately invasive, sensitive, and specific method for image-guided biopsy is highly desirable. FDG-PET currently provides the best tool for diagnostics and has shown huge potential for guiding therapy in lymphomas: an optimized minimally invasive procedure that allows an accurate diagnosis — in particular when standard open lymph node excision is not feasible — could represent a novel standard technique.

Data reported in literature using a PET/CT-driven biopsy approach are increasing progressively but mainly gather patients affected by various malignancies and inflammatory diseases; therefore, an unequivocal conclusion regarding the role of a PET/CT-driven bioptic procedure in a specific neoplastic setting is hard to be drawn. Importantly, all these published series include a relatively small percentage of patients affected by lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders, which rarely exceeds 20% of the enrolled patients. Nevertheless, authors agree that the combination of PET and CT information in aiding needle placement is of great benefit regardless the site of the biopsy, especially in those cases with a poor radiological correlation: this is confirmed by the high diagnostic accuracy rates reported, all above 90%.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast interventional procedures [^ea23cdb3]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging–guided breast biopsy — post-biopsy management states that patients with malignant results should be referred to a surgeon and/or oncologist, and for benign pathology that is radiology/pathology discordant, upgrade rates of at least 30% have been documented; thus, patients with a discordant biopsy are recommended to undergo repeat core needle biopsy (CNB) or surgical excision. Surgical consultation is usually recommended for high-risk findings with the potential for upgrade to malignancy at surgical excision, including atypical ductal hyperplasia, flat epithelial atypia, lobular neoplasia, radial scar, complex sclerosing lesions, phyllodes tumor, and papilloma; several studies have found higher upgrade rates for high-risk lesions detected by MRI rather than mammography or US, though management is controversial and care should be individualized. If a finding is benign, not high risk, and deemed concordant after MRI-guided biopsy, further intervention/excision is usually not performed, but short-term follow-up with diagnostic breast MRI at 6 months may be warranted. Documentation should include record of communication of positive biopsy results with the patient and/or referring physician.

### Use of imaging prior to referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist [^99da34e3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Use of imaging prior to referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist — PICO 8 malignancy: In evaluations against pathological or histologic reference standards, ultrasound (US) performance is reported with specific cutoffs. US (3D automated breast volume scanner) versus pathological diagnosis using radiologist interpretation (margin, shape, internal texture) showed Sens|Spec 0.8182|0.931 with LR+|LR- 12.00|0.20. Hand‑held US versus pathological diagnosis with the same radiologist interpretation yielded 0.7727|0.886 and 6.80|0.26. For US (Sono Vue) versus histology (US‑guided biopsy), the cutoff "3.3 cm or more, and diffuse or peripherally enhanced mass" produced 0.9583|0.777 and 4.31|0.05, while the criterion "5 cm or more, and diffuse or peripherally enhanced mass" yielded 0.8333|1 and 83.33|0.17.

### Comparison of real-time fluorescence confocal digital microscopy with hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of core-needle biopsy specimens [^b82611ba]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

The study had some limitations. Although the FCM images of IR-guided CNB specimens were acquired in real time at the bedside in the radiology suite, they were not interpreted immediately. Therefore, the radiologists performing the biopsy did not receive immediate feedback regarding the quality of the CNB. The tissue integrity of the imaged IR-guided CNB specimen was proven for conventional H&E staining alone and not for ancillary immunohistochemical or genomic testing. Our results need further validation in a multi-institutional study including a larger sample size and interpretation of FCM images by many pathologists practicing in an academic as well as community settings.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography for the assessment of screening recalls: a two-centre study [^a2259b77]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

SA results were categorised according to the BI-RADS classification and women were either referred to biopsy or entered a 2-year follow-up with routine screening mammography and/or breast ultrasound. Conversely, since the reader interpreting CEM had access to the original mammographic images and CEM low-energy images are technically equivalent to a standard mammographic exam in providing a morphologic evaluation of the suspicious findings, CEM interpretation was focused on the recombined images (rCEM), in order to investigate the added value of the functional information provided by these contrast-enhanced images. On the basis of rCEM readings, the reader assessing CEM defined negative findings (i.e. those not needing a biopsy according to rCEM evaluation) and positive findings (those warranting a biopsy referral according to rCEM evaluation). If the reader interpreting CEM identified suspicious lesions different from those that prompted the recall and needing a dedicated work-up, the information was disclosed to the colleague performing SA and the work-up of these additional abnormalities was immediately performed according to the clinical practice currently used for additional findings at breast CE-MRI (targeted ultrasound, additional mammograms/tomosynthesis views, image-guided biopsy). Of note, as this design aims to evaluate the potential of rCEM to reduce the biopsy rate, CEM results could only be used to refer women to biopsy for suspicious findings that were not detectable at SA: biopsies recommended by SA were always performed, even with negative rCEM results.

### Use of research biopsies in clinical trials: are risks and benefits adequately discussed? [^b9ced37a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although the incorporation of research biopsies into clinical trials is increasing, limited information is available about how study protocols and informed consents integrate and describe their use.

Methods

All therapeutic clinical trials in which image-guided research biopsies were performed from January 1, 2005, to October 1, 2010, were identified from an interventional radiology database. Data from study protocols and informed consents were extracted and analyzed. Procedural complications were recorded.

Results

A total of 57 clinical trials were identified, of which 38 (67%) contained at least one mandatory biopsy. The analysis of the research biopsy tumor tissue was a study end point in 95% of trials. The primary indication for a research biopsy was for integral biomarker analysis in 32% and for correlative science in 68% of trials. A statistical analytic plan for the correlative science research biopsy tumor tissue was mentioned in 26%, described as exploratory in 51%, and not mentioned in 23% of trials. For studies with mandatory biopsies, biopsy was an eligibility criterion in 71% of trials, and a statistical justification for the research biopsy sample size was present in 50% of trials. A total of 745 research biopsies were performed on 576 patients. Overall and major complication rates were 5.2% (39 of 745 biopsies) and 0.8% (six of 745 biopsies), respectively. Complication rates for intrathoracic and abdominal/pelvic solid organ biopsies were 17.1% (36 of 211 biopsies) and 1.6% (three of 189 biopsies), respectively. Site-stratified research biopsy-related risks were discussed in five consents.

Conclusion

A better representation of the risks and benefits of research biopsies in study protocols and informed consents is needed.

### Breast imaging training and attitudes: update survey of senior radiology residents [^3a20cb9b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the training and attitudes of senior residents regarding breast imaging.

Materials and Methods

In 2008 a follow-up survey was completed by a chief or senior resident at 201 radiology training programs in North America. Questions included organization of breast imaging rotation, resident responsibilities, clinical practice protocols at the institution, resident impressions regarding breast imaging, and resident interest in performing breast imaging after residency. Results were compared with those of a survey completed in 2000.

Results

Of 201 training programs, 200 (99.5%) had dedicated breast imaging rotations; 190 (95%), 12 weeks or longer; and 39 (19%), 16 weeks or longer. Residents regularly performed real-time ultrasound imaging in 138 programs (69%), needle localization in 159 (79%), ultrasound-guided biopsy in 154 (77%), and stereotactically guided biopsy in 145 programs (72%). One hundred sixty-two residents (81%) reported that interpreting mammograms was more stressful than interpretation of other imaging studies; 143 (71%) believed that only breast imaging subspecialists should interpret mammograms; and 104 (52%) would not consider pursuing a breast imaging fellowship. As in 2000, the most common reasons cited for not considering a fellowship were lack of interest in the field, fear of lawsuits, and the stressful nature of the job.

Conclusion

Residency programs have devoted more time to breast imaging and made improvements in their curricula, but current residents report decreased opportunities to perform some studies and procedures. Although most residents would not consider a fellowship and did not want to interpret mammograms in future practice, the percentage of residents who would not consider breast imaging as a subspecialty has decreased since 2000. An accurate picture of current breast imaging curricula and variations among residency programs is necessary to identify and correct systemic problems and to improve the training of future breast imagers.

### Diagnostic and screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breast [^0db96921]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI performance — Diagnostic breast MRI is not recommended until after clinical breast examination and conventional breast imaging are performed and interpreted unless being performed as part of a standard screening program. Breast MRI requires a high field system (minimum 1.5 Tesla magnet), a dedicated breast surface coil (breast images taken in a body scanner are inadequate) and intravenous gadolinium (or other approved Breast MRI) contrast, and "Open" MRI equipment, designed for claustrophobic patients, is not recommended. Breast MRI should be performed by a dedicated imaging team, and policies for pre-MRI identification of "claustrophobic" and "gadolinium risk" patients should be established. Breast MRI with gadolinium contrast should not be ordered in patients receiving renal dialysis for kidney failure and should be used only with caution and with adequate informed consent in patients with a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and administration of gadolinium contrast is discouraged during pregnancy. If contrast cannot be used, then breast MRI is not recommended in the screening or diagnostic setting, and percutaneous MRI-guided biopsy capability is essential for centers performing breast MRI even though some MRI lesions confirmed on second look US are amenable to US-guided core.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast interventional procedures [^69ecb261]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

ACR MRI-guided breast interventional procedures — postprocedure follow-up and correlation specify that a postprocedure mammogram should be performed in 2 orthogonal views to document biopsy marker position relative to the biopsy site. Postprocedure patient follow-up should consist of documentation of any delayed complications and treatment administered, a determination of concordance of pathology results with imaging findings documented in the final report by the performing physician or designated physician, and management recommendations based on pathology results and imaging pathology concordance or discordance. The technical constraints inherent to MRI biopsy may make the determination of radiologic-pathologic concordance challenging because there is no confirmatory method to verify adequate sampling, the biopsy needle cannot be visualized in real time, and there is no specimen radiograph to confirm sampling; therefore, radiologic-pathologic correlation is imperative, the radiologist performing the procedure (or a qualified designated physician) is responsible for determining concordance or discordance and recommending appropriate management, and upgrade rates to malignancy and false-negatives at biopsy may be higher for MRI-guided biopsy than for stereotactic-guided biopsy and US-guided biopsy, which makes radiologic-pathologic review particularly essential.
