## Question

Apgar score

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Apgar score — specifically, they want a detailed explanation that includes its original purpose and definition, its components and scoring methodology, when and how it is used in practice, its prognostic strengths and limitations, considerations for special populations such as preterm infants and infants with darker skin tones, an assessment of expanded and combined Apgar approaches, and a synthesis of evidence-based conclusions and recommendations for clinical use, with each assertion supported by appropriate references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the original purpose and definition of the Apgar score. Then, I should verify its components and scoring methodology. Next, I will review when and how it is used in practice, followed by its prognostic strengths and limitations. After that, I should examine special populations, including preterm infants and infants with darker skin tones. Then, I will assess the expanded and combined Apgar approaches, and finally synthesize a pragmatic, evidence-based conclusion and recommendations for clinical use, ensuring each assertion is backed by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and purpose, because if I misstate this, everything downstream gets shaky. The Apgar score, developed by Virginia Apgar in 1952, was intended as a rapid, standardized bedside assessment of neonatal condition at 1 and 5 minutes to identify infants needing resuscitation and to facilitate comparison of obstetric and resuscitative practices, not to diagnose asphyxia or predict individual long-term outcomes, which is a common misuse I need to be careful to avoid repeating [^115YRMdB] [^112GmSSy] [^117LpKT4].

> Wait, let me verify the components and scoring so I don't omit a detail. The score evaluates five equally weighted parameters at 1, 5, and optionally 10 minutes: Appearance (color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability), Activity (muscle tone), and Respiration (breathing effort), each scored 0, 1, or 2, for a total 0–10; the 1-minute score reflects intrapartum transition and the 5-minute score better captures the response to resuscitation and recovery, with the 10-minute score reserved for infants who remain unstable, which I should double-check against guideline practice patterns [^115YRMdB] [^115YRMdB].

> Hold on, I should verify current standard practice around timing and repetition. Universal practice remains to assign Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes for all live births, and if the 5-minute score is less than 7, it is recommended to continue reassessment every 5 minutes up to 20 minutes to document response. I initially thought 10 minutes was routine for everyone, but that's not quite right, so I'm correcting that here [^115YRMdB].

> Next, I will examine what the Apgar score is good at predicting, because over-claiming is tempting but misleading. Large cohorts show a strong association between low 5-minute Apgar scores and neonatal and infant mortality, with a markedly increased relative risk for scores 0–3 and 4–6 compared with 7–10, and the signal is strongest at term gestation; for example, a 5-minute score of 0–3 confers roughly a 359-fold adjusted relative risk of early neonatal death at term, underscoring its population-level prognostic value rather than individual diagnostic certainty [^116vzoPp] [^112pXStv] [^1121jNFq].

> I need to check the prognostic performance in preterm infants, because the score behaves differently there. In extremely preterm populations, the Apgar score correlates with mortality in a graded fashion, but its association with severe neurological injury and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes is weak or absent after adjustment, likely due to immature baseline vitality, interobserver variability, and competing NICU exposures; thus, low scores in EPT infants should not be overinterpreted for long-term prognosis without corroborating data [^1121jNFq] [^117R43PT] [^1179GSba].

> But wait, what if the infant has a reassuring Apgar yet hidden acidemia; I should review that gap. Studies that obtained universal cord gases show that even with 5-minute Apgar scores of 7 or higher, a nontrivial fraction have significant umbilical artery acidemia and higher risks of respiratory distress and NICU admission, reminding me not to anchor on Apgar alone when clinical suspicion persists or risk factors are present [^114daTmb].

> I will now examine interobserver reliability, because poor reliability undermines any score's utility. Multiple studies demonstrate substantial variability in Apgar assignment, especially for preterm infants and during resuscitation, with κ values for tone, grimace, and respiration often in the poor-to-fair range; even video-based scoring shows wide dispersion, and clinicians frequently assign high scores retrospectively without assessing each component, which can introduce bias and misclassification in both practice and research [^111ZEiGo] [^115MVRgc] [^113yWAa9].

> Hold on, I should verify equity considerations, particularly around skin color assessment. Observational data show that Black neonates are assigned lower Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes even when umbilical artery gases are similar, largely driven by lower color scores, and this bias can lead to unnecessary NICU admissions; this means I need to ensure objective measures like pulse oximetry and ECG are prioritized over subjective color assessment whenever feasible [^1119UcwG] [^112xe5rg].

> Let me consider the expanded and combined Apgar frameworks, because they attempt to mitigate some limitations. The Specified-Apgar documents the infant's condition independent of interventions, while the Expanded-Apgar quantifies resuscitative measures; together as the Combined-Apgar, they better describe both status and support, and in preterm cohorts the Combined-Apgar has shown superior discrimination for poor outcomes than either score alone, though broader validation and adoption remain limited [^116WVCBd] [^115aNeGn] [^1147z1aB].

> I should double-check which individual components at 1 minute best predict the need for advanced resuscitation, since that guides early decision-making. Analyses using specified scoring show that heart rate, chest movement, and reflex irritability at 1 minute are the strongest predictors of needing intubation, chest compressions, or epinephrine, whereas skin color contributes little predictive value; this supports focusing on objective cardiorespiratory and neurologic signs rather than color when triaging support [^114hXvDb] [^1175bQsS] [^115WSGEL].

> Next, I should review the role of the 10-minute Apgar score, especially when it is zero, because families often ask about survival. Contemporary cohorts and meta-analyses indicate that approximately 40% of infants with a 10-minute Apgar of zero survive, and about 19% survive without moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment, with better outcomes in gestational ages 32 weeks or higher and in the therapeutic hypothermia era; this cautions against using a 10-minute score of zero alone to guide discontinuation decisions without integrating gestational age, response to resuscitation, and evolving objective data [^111rvfrh] [^114oPtdV].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications so I don't miss a key takeaway. The Apgar score remains a useful, universally adopted tool for rapid communication of neonatal status and for population-level risk stratification, but it should not be used to diagnose asphyxia, guide initial resuscitation steps, or predict individual long-term neurologic outcomes; instead, clinicians should prioritize objective measures such as heart rate, effective ventilation, and oxygenation, consider cord gases when available, and apply the expanded or combined Apgar frameworks to document both condition and interventions during ongoing care [^112GmSSy] [^114Eexde] [^115YRMdB].

> Finally, I need to ensure my recommendations align with evidence and are actionable. Use the 1-minute Apgar to flag infants needing immediate support, the 5-minute score to gauge response and communicate risk, and continue to 10–20 minutes only if the infant remains unstable. Avoid overinterpreting low scores in preterm infants, be vigilant for bias in color scoring, and when possible, pair Apgar with objective assessments and the Combined-Apgar to improve clarity and comparability of neonatal condition and the care required [^115YRMdB] [^116WVCBd] [^1119UcwG].

---

The Apgar score is a **rapid, standardized assessment** of newborn status at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, evaluating Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration. It guides immediate resuscitation and is a **strong predictor of neonatal mortality** [^116vzoPp], especially at 5 minutes [^112pXStv], but it is not designed to predict individual neurologic outcomes or diagnose asphyxia [^112GmSSy] [^114Eexde]. Low scores warrant continued resuscitation and monitoring, while normal scores support routine care; the score is less reliable in preterm infants and during ongoing resuscitation, so it should be interpreted with clinical context and, when needed, alongside umbilical cord gases [^114daTmb] [^115goA4M].

---

## Components and scoring

The Apgar score comprises five components, each scored 0, 1, or 2 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes; **scores of 7–10 are normal**, 4–6 indicate moderate impairment, and 0–3 indicate severe distress [^115YRMdB].

| **Component** | **Score 0** | **Score 1** | **Score 2** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Appearance (color) | Blue/pale | Pink body, blue extremities | Completely pink |
| Pulse (heart rate) | Absent | < 100 bpm | ≥ 100 bpm |
| Grimace (reflex irritability) | No response | Grimace/feeble cry | Strong cry/cough/sneeze |
| Activity (muscle tone) | Limp | Some flexion | Active motion |
| Respiration | Absent | Weak/irregular | Strong cry |

---

## Clinical significance

- **Immediate assessment**: Rapidly identifies newborns needing resuscitation or support [^1175bQsS].
- **Resuscitation guidance**: Tracks response to interventions and guides ongoing care [^112GmSSy].
- **Prognostic value**: Strongly predicts neonatal mortality, especially at 5 minutes [^116vzoPp] [^112pXStv].

---

## Limitations

- **Subjectivity**: Interobserver variability, especially in preterm infants [^111ZEiGo] [^115MVRgc].
- **Limited predictive value**: Not designed for neurologic outcome prediction or asphyxia diagnosis [^112GmSSy] [^114Eexde].
- **Influence of interventions**: Scores during resuscitation may not reflect true condition [^112GmSSy] [^1169DK5c].

---

## Association with neonatal outcomes

- **Mortality**: Low 5-minute scores strongly associate with increased neonatal mortality [^116vzoPp] [^112pXStv].
- **Morbidity**: Low scores correlate with higher risks of respiratory distress, seizures, and NICU admission [^117NAvx6].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Limited association with neurologic outcomes; not reliable for individual prediction [^117R43PT] [^112E5AKA].

---

## Modifications and expanded use

Expanded Apgar documents **concurrent interventions** alongside the score to improve interpretation [^112GmSSy] [^115aNeGn]. Specified Apgar adapts scoring for **preterm infants** and during resuscitation to reduce variability [^116WVCBd] [^114RrN1C]. Combined Apgar integrates both approaches for a more **comprehensive assessment** [^116WVCBd] [^1147z1aB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Continue resuscitation and reassess every 5 minutes if the 5-minute score is **less than 7** [^115YRMdB]. The Apgar score is a useful tool for immediate assessment and communication, but it should not be used alone to diagnose asphyxia or predict neurologic outcomes [^112GmSSy] [^114Eexde]. Always interpret scores alongside clinical context, gestational age, and available objective measures [^1169DK5c] [^114daTmb].

---

The Apgar score remains a **cornerstone of newborn assessment**, providing immediate, standardized information on transition and resuscitation needs; while it reliably predicts mortality, it should not be used to infer neurologic prognosis or asphyxia without additional evidence [^112GmSSy] [^116vzoPp].

### APGAR score and neonatal mortality in China: an observational study from a national surveillance system [^112UamZN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To examine the association between the Apgar score and neonatal mortality over gestational age in China and to explore whether this association changed when Apgar scores were combined at 1 and 5min.

Methods

Data for all singleton live births collected from 438 hospitals between 2012 and 2016 were used in this study. Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator adjusted for a complete set of confounders was used to describe the strength of the association between the Apgar score and neonatal mortality.

Results

The relative risks of neonatal death-associated intermediate Apgar score at 5min peaked at 39–40weeks of gestation and subsequently decreased if the gestational age increased to 42weeks or above, in contrast to the low Apgar score. Among both preterm and term new-borns with Apgar scores at 5min, new-borns that were not small for gestational age had a lower mortality rate than those that were small for gestational age. The association between Apgar score and the neonatal mortality was even stronger when scores at 1 and 5min were combined.

Conclusions

Apgar score is not only meaningful for preterm new-borns but also useful for term new-borns, especially term new-borns that are not small for gestational age. Once the baby's Apgar score worsens, timely intervention is needed. There is still a gap between China and high-income countries in terms of sustained treatment of new-borns with low Apgar scores.

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^115WSGEL]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Other alternatives to assess the infant's condition and resuscitative interventions have been proposed in recent years, such as the Neonatal Resuscitation and Adaptation Score (NRAS). However, the prognostic value of its single items has not been evaluated yet. Interestingly, initial grimace and activity have recently been investigated to predict the required level of respiratory support in very preterm infants. Those with low combined grimace and activity scores after placement on the resuscitation bed received a greater amount of cardiovascular support. This is in line with our findings, which show that the combination of reflexes, heart rate and chest movement is predictable of support that is more extensive.

Our data suggest that, in the context of the specified Apgar score, heart rate, chest movement and reflexes are the most important parameters, Heart rate can be measured by a variety of methods, such as auscultation, electrocardiogram or palpation, with low interobserver variability. Heart rate highly affects cardiac output in newborns and thereby influences other components of the Apgar score such as skin color and tone, underlining its importance. Chest movement is accompanied by active respiration or effective ventilation by the caregiver and can be difficult to assess, especially in very low birth weight infants. Nevertheless, effective aeration of the lung is highly important during the feto-neonatal transition. However, because it is more difficult to assess reflex irritability, the interobserver variability is low. Given our results, the assessment of muscle tone and skin color is of lower importance for the prediction of resuscitation, which is consistent with previous data.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^113rrkhx]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of the study

It has been previously shown that not all items of the conventional Apgar score are of equal importance. However, Virginia Apgar did not differentially weigh or remove individual items since it was her intention to have a score that can be "determined easily and without interfering with the care of the infant". The Combined-Apgar never intended to replace but rather to specify the score that has been used worldwide for almost 60 years. Therefore, items were neither changed nor omitted. Furthermore, definition of skin color was not changed despite its poor correlation with oxygen saturation.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^1167sMCm]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

A numerical score that represents the sum of objective findings is a prerequisite to describe the postnatal condition or to compare effects of interventions in the delivery room for groups of infants. Since the infant's condition is affected by medical interventions, it seems mandatory to describe not only the clinical status but also the interventions needed to achieve this condition. During the last centuries, various attempts have been made to describe the infant's condition after birth. Virginia Apgar developed a scoring system that now bears her name and is widely used. Since improvements in neonatal care demanded a recalibration of the Apgar score, the Specified-Apgar was introduced. Using the same items as the original score, it allows detailed descriptions for the infant's condition regardless of GA or interventions. To account for medical interventions required to achieve this condition the AAP and ACOG suggested an expanded reporting form for concurrent resuscitative interventions (Expanded-Apgar). Both scores together give an objective measure of the postnatal condition; however this Combined-Apgar has not been used in clinical studies yet. The multicenter international TEST-Apgar study tested both scores for the first time in a clinical setting. The data show that the combination of assessing infant's condition and administered interventions (Combined-Apgar) is better (to predict death) than the description of condition or interventions alone.

### The new APGAR SCORE: a checklist to enhance quality of life in geriatric patients with hip fracture [^115m79vw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

For geriatric patients with hip fractures, the broken bone is the reason for admission, but only part of the overall disease. Indeed, it may be more helpful to consider the patient having geriatric hip fracture syndrome or sustaining a hip attack, as there are many associated medical, social, psychological, and other problems to which attention must be paid. To that end, we have identified a series of 10 steps, collected into a checklist, that can be undertaken for all patients with geriatric hip fracture. In homage to the maxim "we come into the world under the brim of the pelvis and go out through the neck of the femur", we defined our checklist by the acronym APGAR SCORE, named after the classic checklist of the same name used to assess a newborn child. The 10 elements include attending to problems of Alimentation and nutrition, Polypharmacy, and Gait; initiating a discussion about Advance care planning; correcting any Reversible cognitive impairment; maximizing Social support; checking for and remediating Cataracts or other impairments of vision; assessing for and addressing Osteoporosis; and last, ensuring that Referrals are made and that the patient has a safe Environment after discharge. For the newborn, the Apgar score has been criticized as an imperfect tool, and likewise the problem of geriatric hip fracture will not be solved with this new Apgar score either. Nonetheless, a score of 10 here,1 point for each item, may help to optimize the outcome for this difficult disease.

### Five-minute APGAR score and outcomes in neonates of 24–28 weeks' gestation [^1179GSba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess associations between 5min Apgar score and mortality and severe neurological injury (SNI) and to report test characteristics in preterm neonates.

Design, Setting and Patients

Retrospective cohort study of neonates 24 0 to 28 6 weeks' gestation born between 2007 and 2016 and admitted to neonatal units in 11 high-income countries.

Exposure

5min Apgar score.

Main Outcome Measures

In-hospital mortality and SNI defined as grade 3 or 4 periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. Outcome rates were calculated for each Apgar score and compared after adjustment. The diagnostic characteristics and ORs for each value from 0 versus 1–10 to 0–9 versus 10, with 1-point increments were calculated.

Results

Among 92412 included neonates, as 5min Apgar score increased from 0 to 10, mortality decreased from 60% to 8%. However, no clear increasing or decreasing pattern was identified for SNI. There was an increase in sensitivity and decrease in specificity for both mortality and SNI associated with increasing scores. The Apgar score alone had an area under the curve of 0.64 for predicting mortality, which increased to 0.73 with the addition of gestational age.

Conclusions

In neonates of 24–28 weeks' gestation admitted to neonatal units, higher 5min Apgar score was associated with lower mortality in a graded manner, while the association with SNI remained relatively constant at all scores. Among survivors, low Apgar scores did not predict SNI.

### Variability in APGAR score assignment among clinicians: role of a simple clarification [^113AQrWS]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to evaluate variability in Apgar score (AS) assignment among health care providers (HCPs) and to evaluate whether a simple clarification improves accuracy and consistency of AS assignment. Study Design An electronic questionnaire survey was provided to pediatric residents, nurse practitioners, neonatal fellows, and faculty in level III neonatal intensive care unit and major academic centers in the United State to assign AS for three clinical scenarios. Next, we provided a simple clarification on various components of AS. After review of clarification, responders were asked to provide AS for the same scenarios. We also sought the opinion of responders on the subjectivity of five components of AS. Results A total of 107 responses were collected. Correct assignment before and after clarification improved significantly: heart rate (78 vs. 90%, p = 0.02), reflex (63 vs.75%, p = 0.06), and breathing (82 vs. 96%, p = 0.003). Correct scoring for color and tone were 86 and 67%, respectively. Interobserver agreement improved significantly after clarification. Conclusion There was variability among HCPs for AS assignment, with improvement in correct response as well as consistency after a simple clarification. Availability of this clarification, along with the AS table in delivery room, will improve the correct assignment and consistency of AS for high-risk infants.

### APGAR score and neonatal mortality in China: an observational study from a national surveillance system [^116fmEuJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

The Apgar score has been used to quickly evaluate the physical condition of new-borns after delivery for more than 60 years and is routinely used in obstetrics for every delivery in China. Nevertheless, Apgar scores are often used in the rapid assessment of asphyxia severity in clinical practice in China, although most experts have indicated that Apgar scores should not be used alone to diagnose birth asphyxia, as pointed out in Chinese textbooks of paediatrics. Studies have shown that the Apgar score at 5 min after birth is related to neonatal mortality. A cohort study of the UK from 1992 to 2010 suggested that the mortality rate increased with declining Apgar score at 5 min. However, there are differences in neonatal resuscitation capacity, human resources, and ethics group between China and high-income countries. Whether the association between Apgar scores and neonatal mortality was different in China was uncertain, and the effect of Apgar score in terms of the difference between scores at 1 min and 5 min on neonatal mortality was not shown. Gestational age and birthweight are important indicators in predicting the health status of new-borns, but the association between neonatal mortality and Apgar score stratified by both gestational age and birthweight has also not been reported.

In this study, we first analysed data collected in over 400 hospitals from 2012 to 2016 in China to characterize maternal characteristics and delivery information in relation to Apgar scores at 5 min after birth. Second, we evaluated whether there is a correlation between Apgar score at 5 min and neonatal mortality in China and whether the association differed after adjusting for a complete set of covariates from different gestational age groups. We stratified the analysis by small for gestational age (SGA) categories to further understand the association between neonatal mortality and Apgar score at 5 min in different gestational age groups. The Apgar score is generally calculated at one and 5 min after birth; thus, the effect of the Apgar score on neonatal mortality was examined when scores at both 1 min and 5 min were combined.

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^114hXvDb]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The assessment of the newborn after birth is fundamental for identifying those requiring resuscitation. Certain components of the Apgar score are used to assess neonatal condition, but their value is insufficiently validated. We aimed to identify the components of the Apgar score that predict neonatal resuscitation.

Methods

Individual patient data from two multicenter trials were analyzed. Preterm newborns under 32 weeks of gestation and term newborns with perinatal acidosis and/or resuscitation were included. The extent of resuscitation was quantified by a standardized scoring system, and the clinical condition was quantified by a specified Apgar score. Correlation, linear regression and ROC analyses were used to address the study question.

Results

A total of 2093 newborns were included. Newborns in poor clinical condition at 1 min received more interventions at 5 and 10 min. Heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes and breathing quality, but not skin color, were moderately strong correlated with the extent of resuscitation at 5 (r = 0.44 to 0.52) and 10 min (r = 0.38 to 0.42). Heart rate, reflexes and chest movement at 1 min best predicted the subsequent need for resuscitation (R² = 0.31). The rare interventions of intubation, chest compressions and epinephrine administration can be predicted by the newborn's condition at one minute, with a high sensitivity of 84% (cutoff ≤ 4 Apgar points) or a high specificity of 86% (cutoff ≤ 7 Apgar points).

Conclusions

The clinical impression at 1 min can help to predict the need for medical interventions. Contrary to recent guidelines, heart rate, reflexes and chest movement seem to have the highest values.

Trial Registration

The Test APGAR study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00623038, 14/08/2008).

### Interobserver variability of the 5-minute APGAR score [^115MVRgc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess interobserver variability of Apgar scores assigned with video recordings of neonatal resuscitation (AS(video)) and compare the scores assigned by observers of videos to the Apgar score given by staff attending the delivery (AS(del)).

Study Design

Ten-second clips of 30 newborns taken at 5 minutes were shown to observers. Infants were 23 to 40 weeks' gestation, received varying degrees of resuscitation, and were monitored with pulse oximetry. Forty-two observers (neonatal/obstetric medical/nursing staff) scored infants' respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. The value for heart rate was assigned from the oximeter, which was masked in all clips. All 42 AS(video) and the AS(del) were represented graphically for each infant. Interobserver reliability was assessed by use of a variance components model.

Results

AS(video) varied widely between observers. Variability was large for all 4 elements of the score observers assigned and was seen irrespective of the infant's level of illness. AS(del) was greater than AS(video) in most cases, on average by 2.4 points. There was no evidence that the level of discrepancy was substantially different between groupings of staff.

Conclusion

The Apgar score has poor interobserver reliability. More objective and precise measures of newborns' condition are required.

### A cohort study of low APGAR scores and cognitive outcomes [^115jbi7t]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2008). Low credibility.

Comparisons with other studies

We are not aware of any previous studies that have found an association between a transiently low Apgar score and cognitive defects in subsequently well infants. Seidman et al were unable to show an association between low Apgar scores and IQ at 18 years. Moster et al and Blackmanreported evidence of reduced cognition only in infants who had developed signs of encephalopathy after birth. It is likely that there was limited power in these studies to detect the modest association seen here.

However, the modest effect means that the absolute risk increase of a low IQ score for an individual infant with a briefly low Apgar score is only 0.7%, and 2.4% for infants with prolonged low Apgar scores. The score used in this study has previously been approximated to the more conventional IQ scale(with mean score 100), and on this scale, the proportion of men in this study with a low IQ score (below 81) estimated to be due to all transiently low Apgar scores is only 94 (0.7%) out of a total of 13 448, while infants with briefly low Apgar scores only showed a reduction in mean IQ of 0.5 points, and those with prolonged low Apgar scores a reduction of 1.2 points.

### Factors associated with recovery from 1 minute APGAR score [^111H1dT1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The neonatal Apgar score at 5 min has been found to be a better predictor of outcomes than the Apgar score at 1 min. A baby, however, must pass through the first minute of life to reach the fifth. There has been no research looking at predictors of recovery (Apgar scores ≥ 7) by 5 min in neonates with 1 min Apgar scores < 4.

Methods

An analysis of observational data was conducted using live, singleton, term births recorded in the Malaysian National Obstetrics Registry between 2010 and 2012. A total of 272,472 live, singleton, term births without congential anomalies were recorded, of which 1,580 (0.59%) had 1 min Apgar scores < 4. Descriptive methods and bi- and multi-variable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors associated with recovery (5 min Apgar score ≥ 7) from 1 min Apgar scores < 4.

Results

Less than 1% of births have a 1 min Apgar scores < 4. Only 29.4% of neonates with 1 min Apgar scores < 4 recover to a 5 min Apgar score ≥ 7. Among uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, after controlling for other factors, deliveries by a doctor of neonates with a 1 min Apgar score < 4 had odds of recovery 2.4 times greater than deliveries of neonates with a 1 min Apgar score < 4 by a nurse-midwife. Among deliveries of neonates with a 1 min Apgar score < 4 by doctors, after controlling for other factors, planned and unplanned CS was associated with better odds of recovery than uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Recovery was also associated with maternal obesity, and there was some ethnic variation – in the adjusted analysis indigenous (Orang Asal) Malaysians had lower odds of recovery.

Conclusions

A 1 min Apgar score < 4 is relatively rare, and less than a third recover by five minutes. In those newborns the qualification of the person performing the delivery and the type of delivery are independent predictors of recovery as is maternal BMI and ethnicity. These are associations only, not necessarily causes, and they point to potential areas of research into health systems factors in the labour room, as well as possible biological and cultural factors.

### The APGAR score [^1169DK5c]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The Apgar score provides a convenient shorthand for reporting the status of the newborn infant and the response to resuscitation. The Apgar score has been used inappropriately to predict specific neurologic outcome in the term infant. There are no consistent data on the significance of the Apgar score in preterm infants. The Apgar score has limitations, and it is inappropriate to use it alone to establish the diagnosis of asphyxia. An Apgar score assigned during resuscitation is not equivalent to a score assigned to a spontaneously breathing infant. An expanded Apgar score reporting form will account for concurrent resuscitative interventions and provide information to improve systems of perinatal and neonatal care.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^112xacVt]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Questions that were not answered by the present study

Since there is no other objective measure to describe postnatal condition, poor outcome was used as a surrogate parameter to test the value of the scores in preterm infants. It has already been noted by Virginia Apgar that her score cannot be used to predict survival in an individual infant, but only for a group of infants. For a better prediction of outcome in individual infants other more reliable scores should be used. But it remains unclear, whether this higher predictive value in individuals is of relevance in clinical routine.

Whereas virtually every newborn is evaluated by the Apgar score today, recent studies suggest problems concerning its reproducibility in individual infants. A study, comparing conventional Apgar scores assigned by observers of resuscitation videos to those given by the staff attending the delivery, revealed a poor inter-observer reliability. Similarly, a poor reliability was found when Apgar scores were assessed for written case descriptions. In clinics where case descriptions were scored low, preterm infants received lower Apgar scores as well. It was speculated, that this variability "could also be due to variations in the application of the scoring system". To overcome its poor reproducibility, the Specified-Apgar was introduced, which gives more detailed descriptions of the infant's condition regardless of GA or interventions needed to achieve this condition. Strict definitions – as given by the Specified-Apgar – are needed to minimise variability in the description of infant's condition. However, subsequent studies have to test, whether reproducibility is actually improved by using the Specified-Apgar.

Another important practical aspect of the Combined-Apgar is its applicability for every newborn. The present study has only tested the predictive power in very preterm infants, but the Apgar score is also of importance in resuscitated infants (e.g. it is used as an inclusion criterion for hypothermia). Considering the large variation in the conventional Apgar score for an individual infant depending on the care givers opinion, it could be assumed that the Combined-Apgar will be a better discriminator. However, the predictive power of the Combined-Apgar for subsequent neurological impairment has to be tested in asphyxiated infants.

### A critical appraisal of tools for delivery room assessment of the newborn infant [^115goA4M]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of an infant's condition in the delivery room represents a prerequisite to adequately initiate medical support. In her seminal paper, Virginia Apgar described five parameters to be used for such an assessment. However, since that time maternal and neonatal care has changed; interventions were improved and infants are even more premature. Nevertheless, the Apgar score is assigned to infants worldwide but there are concerns about low interobserver reliability, especially in preterm infants. Also, resuscitative interventions may preclude the interpretation of the score, which is of concern when used as an outcome parameter in delivery room intervention studies. Within the context of these changes, we performed a critical appraisal on how to assess postnatal condition of the newborn including the clinical parameters of the Apgar score, as well as selected additional parameters and a proposed new scoring system. The development of a new scoring system that guide clinicians in assessing infants and help to decide how to support postnatal adaptation is discussed. IMPACT: This critical paper discusses the reliability of the Apgar score, as well as additional parameters, in order to improve assessment of a newborn's postnatal condition. A revised neonatal scoring system should account for infant maturity and the interventions administered. Delivery room assessment should be directed toward determining how much medical support is needed and how the infant responds to these interventions.

### Five-minute APGAR score and educational outcomes: retrospective cohort study of 751, 369 children [^117UUGbw]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Apgar score is used worldwide for assessing the clinical condition and short-term prognosis of newborn infants. Evidence for a relationship with long-term educational outcomes is conflicting. We investigated whether Apgar score at 5 min after birth was associated with additional support needs (ASN) and educational attainment.

Methods

Data on pregnancy, delivery and later educational outcomes for children attending Scottish schools between 2006 and 2011 were collated by linking individual-level data from national educational and maternity databases. The relationship between Apgar score and overall ASN, type-specific ASN and educational attainment was assessed using binary, multinomial and generalised ordinal logistic regression models, respectively. Missing covariate data were imputed.

Results

Of the 751,369 children eligible, 9741 (1.3%) had a low or intermediate Apgar score and 49,962 (6.6%) had ASN. Low Apgar score was independently associated with overall ASN status (adjusted OR for Apgar ≤ 3, OR 1.52 95% CI 1.35 to 1.70), as well as ASN due to cognitive (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47), sensory (OR 2.49 95% CI 1.66 to 3.73) and motor (OR 3.57, 95% CI 2.86 to 4.47) impairments. There was a dose-response relationship between Apgar score and overall ASN status: of those scoring 0–3, 10.1% had ASN, compared with 9.1% of those scoring 4–7 and 6.6% of those scoring 7–10. A low Apgar score was associated with lower educational attainment, but this was not robust to adjustment for confounders.

Conclusions

Apgar scores are associated with long-term as well as short-term prognoses, and with educational as well as clinical outcomes at the population level.

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^114Jm3DV]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several significant limitations to this study that should be noted. The study used retrospective data from a single center. The ten outcomes had a wide range of incidences, which can have an effect on predictive values, for example, and several are associated primarily with prematurity, specifically RDS, BPD, ROP, IVH, and NEC, but previous studies have included Apgar scores in risk assessments for these conditions. We chose to include all gestational ages in our analysis because all newborns receive an Apgar score. Additionally, even though the incidence of several of the prematurity-related outcomes is very low in the term subjects, the proportion of cases made up of term infants is high. For example, for RDS, the incidence in term infants was 1.5% compared to 63% of those < 33 weeks, but because there were 25 times as many term as very preterm subjects, term infants made up 29% of those with RDS. Prematurity was also a cofactor used in the multivariate analyses to help account for its influence. The accuracy of discharge diagnosis codes has been questioned. As one example, we found several instances where codes for both TTNB and RDS were assigned to the same subject. Our goal was to ensure that all potential cases were captured, so we used a wide range of codes. As a result, for some short-term outcomes, such as MAS, there was a high incidence. Additionally, other risk factors such as maternal age or maternal chorioamnionitis were not included. We chose to use the two most common cut-off values at 1 and 5 minutes rather than all the Apgar scores from 1 to 10 to account for some of the known variability in scoring and capture a sufficient number of subjects per outcome to analyze. Other investigators have used the complete Apgar scale, usually.in long term outcome studies involving over one million subjects. Finally, Dr. Apgar designed her system to assess the status of the infant immediately after birth. Starting in 1966, however, it has been used as a risk factor hundreds of times.

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^1175bQsS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The need for subsequent neonatal resuscitation can be predicted by the infant's condition at 1 min using either all 5 specified items of the Apgar score or only its three components, heart rate, reflexes and chest movement. The condition at 1 min helps to identify newborns requiring caregivers that are more experienced.

### Application of machine learning in identifying risk factors for low APGAR scores [^111u62Vv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Factors influencing low APGAR scores

Low APGAR scores often indicate underlying health issues in newborns and are influenced by a combination of demographic and obstetric factors. Understanding these influences is critical for healthcare providers to assess and manage neonatal health effectively. Demographic factors such as maternal age, parental education levels, place of residence, maternal occupation, and parental consanguinity significantly impact neonatal outcomes by shaping access to healthcare and resources. Obstetric factors, including parity, gestational age, maternal health status, body mass index (BMI), birth weight, mode of delivery, and the number of antenatal visits (particularly exceeding four), also play a crucial role. Additionally, a history of stillbirths, abortions, or previous cesarean sections further complicates neonatal outcomes.

Collecting and analyzing these demographic and obstetric data points from patient records allows healthcare providers to better understand their effects on neonatal health. Such insights enable targeted interventions to improve newborn health outcomes.

Efforts to improve the predictive accuracy of low APGAR scores have increasingly focused on identifying relevant risk factors using both traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches. AI, particularly machine learning (ML), has gained significant traction in the medical field due to its ability to analyze large, complex datasets and uncover patterns that may be difficult to detect using conventional methods. For example, studies have shown that ML algorithms can effectively predict low APGAR scores by analyzing predictors such as birth weight, maternal age, and gestational age.

Machine learning offers healthcare professionals a powerful tool to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce medical errors, and improve the accuracy of newborn health assessments. By integrating ML into neonatal care, healthcare providers can better allocate resources, reduce workloads, and implement timely interventions for at-risk infants. Research has demonstrated that ML-based models significantly enhance the predictive performance of neonatal outcome assessments, contributing to improved clinical management and overall neonatal health.

In summary, the integration of machine learning into neonatal care holds great promise for predicting low APGAR scores and guiding timely interventions. This study aims to harness ML techniques to identify key risk factors for low APGAR scores, ultimately improving neonatal health outcomes.

### The APGAR score [^115khdbk]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apgar score" for neonatal resuscitation and tracheoesophageal malformations.

The Apgar Score is a quick, simple, and effective method used to assess the physical condition of a newborn immediately after birth. This scoring system was developed by Dr. Virginia Apgar in 1952. It is applied to newborns at 1 and 5 minutes after birth.

The Apgar Score evaluates five critical health aspects of the newborn: Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability), Activity (muscle tone), and Respiration (breathing rate and effort). Each category is scored from 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score. The scores are then summed to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 10.

The clinical utility of the Apgar Score is to quickly determine if the newborn needs immediate medical or emergency care. It helps in assessing the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts and in deciding whether further resuscitation is required.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Apgar Score. However, it is important to note that the Apgar Score is not designed to predict long-term health outcomes or developmental issues in children. It is a short-term newborn assessment tool.

The Apgar score is a quick and practical method used to assess a newborn's physical health immediately after birth by evaluating five criteria: color, heart rate, activity, reflex irritability, and respirations. Each of these criteria is scored on a scale from 0 to 2, with the total score ranging from 0 to 10. The evaluation leads to an interpretation of the newborn's condition, guiding potential medical interventions.

Scoring is as follows:

- **Color**:

- Completely pink = 2
- Blue extremities, pink body = 1
- Blue/pale = 0
- **Heart Rate**:

- ≥ 100 BPM = 2
- < 100 BPM = 1
- Absent = 0
- **Activity**:

- Active motion = 2
- Some extremity flexion = 1
- Limp = 0
- **Reflex Irritability**:

- Cry = 2
- Grimace = 1
- No response = 0
- **Respirations**:

- Strong cry = 2
- Weak cry = 1
- Absent = 0

The score is obtained by summing the individual scores for these categories. The total score provides a snapshot of the newborn's condition:

- A score of 7 to 10 is deemed Normal, suggesting the newborn is in good health and requires no immediate medical intervention.
- Scores of 4, 5, or 6 are labeled Below normal, indicating that the newborn may need some intervention or monitoring.
- A score of 3 or below is considered Critically low, meaning immediate medical attention is required to address potential health issues.

This straightforward assessment tool assists healthcare providers in determining the subsequent steps for the newborn's care just moments after birth, with higher scores reflecting better physical conditions.

### Neuromuscular components of APGAR score in predicting delivery room respiratory support [^111zX78B]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Newborn wellbeing is documented by use of Apgar scores after every delivery of the infant all over the world. Scores developed by Dr Virginia Apgar in 1952 are still considered as the gold standard for the assessment of newborns at 1 and 5 min of age by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Five elements of Apgar scores namely heart rate, respiration, color, activity (muscle tone) and grimace (reflexes) constitute equal points ranging from 0 to 2 leading to maximum score of 10 points. Neonatal resuscitation program typically focuses on heart rate, breathing and color (oxygen saturations) for steps in performing resuscitation. There is less emphasis given for grimace and activity during decision making at the time of resuscitation. Even though activity and grimace essentially reflect neuromuscular response of the infant with tone and reflexes respectively its utility has been limited especially in preterm infants. While assessment of heart rate, breathing and color are easy to interpret with placement of cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter in preterm infants there is significant variability between delivery room personnel to interpret scoring of activity and grimace as compared to term infants.

Majority of very preterm infants require some form of resuscitation ranging from oxygen through mask or nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to intubation with advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is of utmost importance to provide the optimum respiratory support in these preterm infants to avoid further morbidities which may lead to long term consequences. Current delivery room decisions while caring for preterm infants are based on the response to initial steps of resuscitation as well as individual experience of personnel leading resuscitation and local practice standards. Predicting stability in these infants is the highest priority in order to avoid unnecessary escalation of support. Even if the decisions to provide or escalate respiratory support are made based on heart rate and oxygen saturations in reality getting accurate heart rate and oxygen saturations in the first minutes of life in very preterm infants may not be always feasible with pulse oximetry. The study by Tuttle et al in this edition of Pediatric Research have addressed the concerns in predicting interpersonal variability and assessing need for respiratory support while focusing on two of the least relied upon components of Apgar score namely grimace and activity.

### Should indicators be correlated? Formative indicators for healthcare quality measurement [^113brLhf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

The case for formative quality indicators

The reflective approach to measurement assumes that indicator values reflect a common, underlying property (eg, of an individual or an organisation) and should therefore be highly correlated. This is often the case in psychometrics, for example, when a person's general intelligence determines how well she or he does in various cognitive tests (eg, reasoning, knowledge, working memory). In contrast, with the formative approach to measurement, the goal is to measure a combination of features and thus the indicators need not be correlated. A typical example is the Apgar score, an assessment of the state of a newborn infant based on five components (respiratory effort, heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, colour). Whether or not these components are correlated has no bearing on the usefulness of the Apgar score. Figure 1 illustrates the two different approaches to measurement.

Figure 1
Two fundamental concepts for measurements. Reflective indicators (left) reflect an underlying property of an individual or an organisation. For example, different indicators of cognitive ability (reasoning, knowledge, working memory) reflect an individual's general intelligence. Formative indicators (right) measure a combination of features of a phenomenon of interest. For example, the Apgar score summarises five components of a newborn infant's health (respiratory effort, heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, colour).

In many cases, quality indicators are formative: they do not reflect a single underlying property but rather different aspects of quality, which do not necessarily have a common cause and thus are not expected to be correlated. For example, quality of care frameworks are typically multidimensional, distinguishing between, for example, the effectiveness, safety and patient-centredness of care. A provider that achieved desirable patient outcomes (effectiveness) may not necessarily have provided care in a responsive and respectful manner (patient-centredness). Moreover, even within the same quality dimension, a provider may do well in one aspect of care, but less so in another. For instance, a patient may have been provided with information about different treatment options (one aspect of patient-centredness), but the staff may not have answered his or her questions clearly (another aspect of patient-centredness).

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^1161afip]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Apgar scoring system was developed by Dr. Virginia Apgar over 70 years ago as a tool to assess the condition of a newborn at birth based on five variables: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. Its original purpose was to allow for immediate observation and prompt identification of newborns who need resuscitative measures during transition to extrauterine life. However, over the ensuing seven decades, despite the advancement made in evidence-based newborn resuscitation and the advent of Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) that requires evaluation of the newborn infant without any role for the Apgar score, its international recognition and universal use continues.

Over those years, the use of the Apgar scoring tool has gone far beyond its original purpose to guide clinical management decisions and establish a correlation to long term infant health outcomes. In a review of 501 papers published in 2018–19, the Apgar score was used as a prognostic factor for outcomes in 19%, more than half of these focused on short term morbidities. Numerous studies have examined the association between low Apgar score and a variety of short-term neonatal morbidities but the significance and value of a low Apgar score in identifying newborn infants likely to manifest these morbidities has not been systematically examined.

### Relationship between APGAR scores and morbidity and mortality outcomes in preterm infants: a single-centre cohort study [^111SJpqT]. Neonatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Apgar scoring in modern practice has extended beyond the original described remit by Virginia Apgar, including prognostication. Prognostic value of Apgar scoring in preterm populations is unsupported by robust evidence.

Objectives

We aimed to identify the association between mortality or a composite mortality/major morbidity outcome in preterm infants with 1-min, 5-min, and sum 1 + 5-min Apgar scores.

Methods

Seven-year retrospective data was analysed on neonates born < 32 weeks gestation in a regional neonatal centre. Co-primary outcomes were mortality and composite mortality/major morbidity. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Results

394 infants were included in the analysis. In neonates born < 28 weeks gestation, no significant association was found between Apgar scores and the co-primary outcomes. In neonates born ≥ 28 weeks, low 1-min (aOR 10.452 [1.273, 85.835] for scores 4–6, 22.173 [2.666, 184.438] for scores 0–3), 5-min (4.724 [1.616, 13.806] for scores 4–6, 11.178 [1.803, 69.299] for scores 0–3), and sum 1 + 5-min Apgar scores (12.447 [2.674, 57.941] for scores 4–6, 55.960 [8.333, 375.804] for scores 0–3) were associated with significantly increased aOR of mortality. Increased aOR of composite mortality/major morbidity were also seen in neonates with moderately low (4–6) Apgar scores (aOR 3.104 [1.522, 6.328] for 1 min, 2.804 [1.406, 5.594] for 5 min, and 3.232 [1.769, 5.905] for 1 + 5 min).

Conclusions

Apgar scoring at 1 and 5 min has limited prognostic accuracy for extremely preterm infants but is prognostic in older infants. Sum Apgar scores, a measure of initial condition and response to resuscitation, may be a better predictor of mortality than individual scores.

### APGAR score and neonatal mortality in China: an observational study from a national surveillance system [^111nRjUt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our analysis, 7633 deaths at 26 or more completed weeks of gestation were reported in 438 health facilities between 2012 and 2016, giving a weighted neonatal mortality of 1.1 per 1000 live births, which was similar to the rate reported in the UK. Among births between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation, the adjusted overall neonatal mortality was 1.18%, similar to the rate estimated in Dallas, TX, USA (1.02%).

As a value that quantifies the effects of obstetric anaesthesia, the 10-point Apgar score, regardless of underlying cause, has been routinely used worldwide for more than 60 years, since 1953, to quickly and summarily assess the condition and prognosis of every new-born child. The Apgar score at 5 min after birth has been used more widely as an index of the early neonatal condition than the 1-min Apgar score. Despite the warning against overinterpretation of the score for predicting children's outcomes that has been in place since the Apgar score was proposed, associations between the Apgar score and short-term or long-term health outcomes have still been reported. Several studies present an opinion that the Apgar score is antiquated because of the dramatic changes in the care of new-borns over the past 60 years, but studies have still found that the Apgar score is useful for evaluating the risk of neonatal death clinically. With advances in technology, there are indeed some more accurate assessment methods, such as blood pH, umbilical cord arterial lactate, base excess (BE) and other indicators that reflect metabolic acidosis. However, these advanced indicators are not available in all hospitals in China. Only a small number of high-level hospitals (Level 3 hospitals) can provide these advanced tests. However, a large number of low-level hospitals (Level 1 and Level 2 hospitals) are unable to use these advanced indicators. In addition, it takes a long time to obtain the results of these indicators. The advantage of the Apgar score over these advanced indicators is that it is immediately available on site, and the results based on the score can also be used for timely intervention treatment. Therefore, the Apgar score has been used clinically to guide neonatal resuscitation. Given that the Apgar score does have some subjectivity, it should be assessed by both the obstetrician and the neonatologist to improve the accuracy.

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^115ih62e]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association and utility of low 1- and 5-min Apgar scores to identify short-term morbidities in a large newborn cohort.

Methods

15,542 infants > 22 weeks gestation from a single center were included. Clinical data and low Apgar scores were analyzed for significance to ten short-term outcomes and were used to construct Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves and the AUC calculated for ten outcomes.

Results

A low Apgar score related to all (1-min) or most (5-min) outcomes by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Including any of the 4 low Apgar scores only improved the clinical factor AUC by 0.9% ± 2.7% (± SD) and was significant in just 5 of the 40 score/outcome scenarios.

Conclusion

The contribution of a low Apgar score for identifying risk of short-term morbidity does not appear to be clinically significant.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^113yRmUt]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the TEST-Apgar study was as follows: the Combined-Apgar is a better predictor of poor outcome in preterm infants (defined as either death or any major morbidity during the first hospital stay) than either the Specified-Apgar or Expanded-Apgar alone.

### Factors associated with recovery from 1 minute APGAR score [^117VtaUw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The granularity of the data from general administrative registries is necessarily going to be lower than they would be in cohort studies looking at specific questions. Choices need to be made about the limited kinds of data that can be collected routinely within a functioning health care unit that is not dedicated to research. In choosing to record certain data and not other data, there is an obvious concern with residual confounding; that is, failing to account for a relevant factor in the adjusted analyses. Apgar recovery is likely, for example, to be strongly associated with the resuscitative skills, technology, and protocols available on each of the labour wards across the 14 hospitals. This is not recorded in the registry, but critical for drawing more definitive conclusions from the data. Notwithstanding the issues of residual confounding, as part of a more general study of possible associations, these kinds of data fulfil an important hypothesis generating role, including hypotheses about other possible unmeasured factors.

Finally, there is some question about the capacity of healthcare professionals to make valid and reliable assessments of neonatal Apgar scores. One of the studies that highlighted issues of reliability in Apgar assessment was based on the evaluation of neonates from 23 to 40 weeks gestation, and the other considered very low birth weight neonates with a range of gestational ages. The design of the reliability studies ignored the very high base rate of Apgar scores ≥ 7 and selected a wider range and more critical clinical presentations than would be expected on a normal delivery ward. In this study all the neonates with 1 min Apgar scores < 4 had reached term, and one might anticipate that term singleton births are easier to assess with greater reliability. Futhermore, even allowing for variation in staff clinical assessment, the vast majority of the neonates had Apgar scores ≥ 7: 97.25% of neonates had a 1 min Apgar score ≥ 7 and 99.3% had a 5 min score ≥ 7. Accepting the average variation in Apgar assessment across clinical staff of 2.4 points, the separation used in this study between a 1 min Apgar scores < 4 and an 1 min Apgar score ≥ 7 ensured little room for error in category.

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^111TxrQj]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths include a larger number of subjects than most studies which have examined the Apgar score in relation to short term outcomes. While we looked at the common ways of assessing a risk factor, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and the odds ratio within the context of a multivariable analysis as well as the AUC of the ROC graphs, adding the AUC analysis with and without the low Apgar is a way to directly assess the question of its utility.

The Apgar score has been performed around the world to an estimated three billion or more newborn infants over the last 70 years. During that time, concerns have been repeatedly raised about it. Yet it remains an important tool in the delivery room for assessing the immediate condition of the newborn. It appears to have good utility for assessing risks of long-term outcomes when applied to large populations, but our findings suggest that it is not a significant contributor to identifying newborn infants who would benefit from a higher level of care because of the risk of short-term outcomes.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^116mDjKS]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite improvements in the care of infants born EPT and increasing survival rates in this population, the risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment remains high, with a tremendous disease burden. Therefore, it is essential to identify infants at risk early in their life course to enable optimal decisions about care and early intervention. However, as this cohort study found, low Apgar scores at 5 minutes of life were not associated with impaired cognitive or motor outcomes at age 5 years, in contrast with results in infants born at term. Divergent outcomes from our study and those of infants born at term are in line with previous results on the association of low Apgar scores and risk of mortality, which found weaker associations at lower gestational ages. Our results complement previous studies on the prognostic value of the Apgar score in children born EPT, which support its utility for estimating survival but not longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Acidemia in neonates with a 5-minute APGAR score of 7 or greater-what are the outcomes? [^114daTmb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Apgar score is universally used for fetal assessment at the time of birth, whereas, the collection of fetal cord blood gases is performed commonly in high-risk situations or in the setting of Apgar scores of < 7, which is a less standardized approach. It has been well-established that neonatal acidemia at the time of delivery can result in significant neonatal morbidity and death. Because of this association, knowledge of the fetal acid-base status and detection of acidemia at the time of delivery can serve as a sensitive and useful component in the assessment of a neonate's risk. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis is an accurate and validated tool for the assessment of neonatal acidemia at the time of delivery. Because the collection of fetal cord blood gases is not a standardized practice, it is possible that, with such a varied approach, some cases of neonatal acidemia are not detected, particularly in the setting of reassuring Apgar scores.

Objective

In a setting of universally obtained cord blood gases, we sought to identify the rates of acidemia and associated factors in neonates with 5-minute Apgar scores of ≥ 7.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study identified all term, singleton, nonanomolous neonates with 5-minute Apgar scores of ≥ 7. The incidence of umbilical artery pH ≤ 7.0 or ≤ 7.1 and base excess ≤ -12 mmol/L or ≤ -10 mmol/L were examined overall and in association with obstetric complications and adverse neonatal outcomes. Chi-squared tests were used to compare proportions, and multivariable logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders.

Results

In this cohort, the incidence of an umbilical artery pH of ≤ 7.0 was 0.5%, of a pH ≤ 7.1 was 3.4%, of a base excess ≤ -12 mmol/L was 1.4%, and of ≤ -10 mmol/L was 4.0%. Rates of neonatal acidemia were greater in the setting of meconium (4.3% vs 3.2%; P < .001), placental abruption (13.2% vs 3.4%; P < .001), and cesarean deliveries (5.8% vs 2.8%; P < .001), despite normal 5-minute Apgar scores. Additionally, umbilical artery pH ≤ 7.0 was associated with an increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted odds ratio, 6.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.9–14.3) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 6.8–17.4). Base excess of ≤ -12 mmol/L was also associated with an increased risk of neonatal sepsis (adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–12.1). Finally, when examined together, neonates with both a pH of ≤ 7.0 and base excess of ≤ -12 mmol/L continued to demonstrate an increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit admission and respiratory distress syndrome, with adjusted odds ratios of 9.6 and 6.0, respectively. This risk persisted in neonates with a pH of ≤ 7.1 and base excess of ≤ -10 mmol/L as well, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.5 and 1.1, respectively.

Conclusion

Because neonates with reassuring Apgar scores have a residual risk of neonatal acidemia that is associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes, the potential utility of obtaining universal cord blood gases should be further investigated.

### APGAR score and the risk of cause-specific infant mortality: a population-based cohort study [^116vzoPp]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Apgar score has been used worldwide as an index of early neonatal condition for more than 60 years. With advances in health-care service provision, neonatal resuscitation, and infant care, its present relevance is unclear. The aim of the study was to establish the strength of the relation between Apgar score at 5 min and the risk of neonatal and infant mortality, subdivided by specific causes.

Methods

We linked routine discharge and mortality data for all births in Scotland, UK between 1992 and 2010. We restricted our analyses to singleton livebirths, in women aged over 10 years, with a gestational age at delivery between 22 and 44 weeks, and excluded deaths due to congenital anomalies or isoimmunisation. We calculated the relative risks (RRs) of neonatal and infant death of neonates with low (0–3) and intermediate (4–6) Apgar scores at 5 min referent to neonates with normal Apgar score (7–10) using binomial log-linear modelling with adjustment for confounders. Analyses were stratified by gestational age at birth because it was a significant effect modifier. Missing covariate data were imputed.

Findings

Complete data were available for 1,029,207 eligible livebirths. Across all gestational strata, low Apgar score at 5 min was associated with an increased risk of neonatal and infant death. However, the strength of the association (adjusted RR, 95% CI referent to Apgar 7–10) was strongest at term (p < 0.0001). A low Apgar (0–3) was associated with an adjusted RR of 359.4 (95% CI 277.3–465.9) for early neonatal death, 30.5 (18.0–51.6) for late neonatal death, and 50.2 (42.8–59.0) for infant death. We noted similar associations of a lower magnitude for intermediate Apgar (4–6). The strongest associations were for deaths attributed to anoxia and low Apgar (0–3) for term infants (RR 961.7, 95% CI 681.3–1357.5) and preterm infants (141.7, 90.1–222.8). No association between Apgar score at 5 min and the risk of sudden infant death syndrome was noted at any gestational age (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.1–4.6 at term; 1.2, 0.3–4.8 at preterm).

Interpretation

Low Apgar score at 5 min was strongly associated with the risk of neonatal and infant death. Our findings support its continued usefulness in contemporary practice.

### Factors associated with 5-min APGAR score, death and survival in neonatal intensive care: a case-control study [^112dLXeU]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The 5-minute APGAR score is clinically used as a screening tool to assess how the newborn has reacted to previous care, remaining relevant for predicting neonatal survival. This study aimed to analyze the determinants of the 5th minute APGAR score, and the factors associated with the death and survival of newborns with low APGAR scores hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a referral public hospital in North Brazil.

Methods

This was a hospital-based retrospective case-control study with 277 medical records. Newborns who presented with a 1-minute APGAR score < 7 followed by a 5-minute APGAR score < 7 were considered cases, while a score ≥ 7 was categorized as controls. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to establish the determinant factors of the low APGAR score and death outcome in this group. Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and then univariate and multivariate Cox regression was performed.

Results

After adjusted analysis, the factor associated with low APGAR scores was vaginal delivery (OR = 3.25, 95%CI = 1.60–6.62, p = 0.001). Birth injury (OR = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.19–0.83, p = 0.014) was associated with upper APGAR scores. No significant independent associations were observed between the variables analyzed and death in the low APGAR score group. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that individuals who presented Cesarean delivery had a shorter survival time in the ICU.

Conclusion

In this setting, a 5-minute Apgar score < 7 was associated with the occurrence of vaginal delivery and birth injury with a 5-minute Apgar score ≥ 7. Survival in ICU was lower in newborns that were delivered via cesarean section.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^116WVCBd]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An objective assessment of infant's postnatal condition in the delivery room is essential for clinical care and scientific purposes. To describe the postnatal condition of groups of infants or to compare effects of interventions in a research setting a numerical score, which represents the sum of several objective findings is required.

To describe the condition of a newborn, Virginia Apgar developed a system that scores the postnatal condition by converting clinical observations into quantifiable scientific data. However, there is no general agreement on how to score infants with a low gestational age or those receiving interventions. To overcome that problem, we suggested to specify the items of the conventional Apgar and to score infant's condition regardless of gestational age and interventions (Specified-Apgar). According to the rules of the Specified-Apgar, the full score with a maximum total of 10 points can either be allocated to the healthy term or preterm infant without any problems in postnatal adaptation, but also to an infant receiving resuscitative or supportive interventions with an adequate response to those interventions (good chest expansion during ventilation, pink skin colour due to supplemental oxygen, etc.). To better differentiate between both conditions, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggested to also score and document the interventions that are required to achieve the condition (Expanded-Apgar). Consequently, an infant without any interventions would have a higher Expanded-Apgar than the one who requires interventions. It can be assumed that an infant's condition is better described using both scores (Combined-Apgar) simultaneously than one score alone.

Up until now, both scores are not used in clinical practise mainly because of not being validated yet.

The multicenter, international TEST-Apgar study (" T rial to E valuate a S pecified T ype of Apgar ") aimed to answer the question, whether the Combined-Apgar describes infant's postnatal condition better than either the Specified-Apgar or Expanded-Apgar alone. Since no "gold standard" was available, we decided to use prediction of mortality and morbidity as a proxy for testing. That outcome criterion was only used as a surrogate parameter for the purpose of testing the scores. It was not the aim to develop a new tool which predicts mortality or morbidity, but to test that the Combined-Apgar provides a good numerical description of infant's postnatal condition.

### The determinants of 5th minute low APGAR score among newborns who delivered at public hospitals in hawassa city, south Ethiopia [^111eGEke]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
How numerical ratings are assigned to describe the five Apgar signs and symptoms used to assess a baby's condition at birth

Globally, nearly 7,000 newborns die every day at a rate of 19 per 1,000 live births and an estimated 23% of neonatal deaths and 10% of all deaths in under-five children occur as a result of the low Apgar score. Birth asphyxia is a global problem, especially in developing countries and the severity of asphyxia is widely assessed using the Apgar score. Worldwide, 4 million deaths occur annually due to birth asphyxia, representing 38% of all deaths in children under five years of age. In developing countries, neonatal mortality and morbidity due to low Apgar scores account for 100–250/1000 live births compared to 5–10/1000 live births in developed countries. In Ethiopia, the neonatal mortality rate is 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. Besides, in Gondar Ethiopia, 13.8% of neonates had a low Apgar score at the 5th minute of life and among these 22.2% died within the neonatal period.

If the world goes through with the current pace, 28 million newborns would die between 2018 and 2030, and the majority of these deaths would occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Reducing neonatal mortality is important not only to reduce the proportions of under-five mortality but also the health interventions needed to address the major causes of neonatal deaths generally differ from those needed to address other under-five deaths. Reducing the low Apgar score has an important contribution to the achievement of SDG in reducing neonatal mortality.

A neonate's continued capacity to survive and thrive can be shown by five minutes Apgar score. If there is a change in recovery rates between a few minutes of newborn life, significant clinical information can be detected. Furthermore, it provides acumen into health system issues in the intrapartum period. Understanding the factors associated with the transition between the 1st minute Apgar score and 5th minute Apgar score has the potential to provide time for intervention or further investigation. For this reason, the Apgar score at 5 min is a better forecaster of later outcomes than the Apgar score at 1 min.

### The determinants of 5th minute low APGAR score among newborns who delivered at public hospitals in hawassa city, south Ethiopia [^114ZyrB2]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The neonatal period refers to birth to the first 28 days of life and the most perilous period of life because of the numerous challenges that the neonate faces. The risk of mortality is the highest during this period of life. The APGAR is a general and quick assessment of newborn well-being immediately after birth and is recorded at one minute and five minutes from the time of birth. The Apgar scoring system offers a consistent assessment of infants after delivery. The one minute Apgar score indicates the baby's physical health and to determine whether immediate or future medical treatment will be required. The five-minute Apgar score assesses how the baby has reacted to previous resuscitation attempts if such efforts were made.

The score ranges from 0 to 2 for each of the five characteristics with a maximum final total score of ten (See Table 1 below). At the 1 min APGAR, scores between 7 and 10 indicate that the baby will need only routine post-delivery care. Scores between 4 and 6 indicate that some assistance for breathing might be required. Scores under four can call for prompt measures. A five minute Apgar score of 7–10 is normal. If the score is below seven, the baby will continue to be monitored and re-evaluated every 5 min for up to 20 min. Thus, the Apgar score system has a continuing value for predicting neonatal and post-neonatal adverse outcomes and is applicable to singleton and twin pregnancies and in various race/ethnic groups.

Fig. 2
Weighted neonatal mortality in the Apgar score group at 5 min stratified by gestational age

Apgar score stratified by gestational age at birth was strongly associated with neonatal mortality. Compared with those of a normal Apgar score at 5 min, the RRs of neonatal death associated with a low Apgar score at 5 min increased greatly and progressively with advancing gestational age after adjustment for several related factors. The peak was apparent at gestational ages of 42 weeks or above (Fig. 3). In contrast, the RRs associated with intermediate Apgar scores at 5 min after birth peaked at 39–40 weeks of gestation and subsequently decreased as the gestational age increased to 42 weeks or above while remaining statistically significant.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^113yWAa9]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, although each neonate is assigned an Apgar score, it is suggested that it is seldom used to determine clinical management and is often assigned in retrospect. This is best demonstrated through a United States's study which showed 90% of nurses assigned an Apgar score within a vignette even when data for some Apgar score components were absent, for example heart rate or respiration rate. A correct Apgar score was assigned only 19% to 57% of the time and inter-rater agreement was poor. This has additionally been confirmed through qualitative interviews, where healthcare professionals stated that they simply assigned an Apgar score of 9 or 10 if a neonate was alert and crying without actually assessing each component.

While many high resource countries have moved away from using the Apgar score as a tool for decision-making and rely more on pulse oximetry and electrocardiograms, such medical technology is not always available especially in low resource settings and rural locations. It is therefore of paramount importance that more research is undertaken in countries where the Apgar score is still relied upon for clinical decision making for example some countries in Africa, Asian, and Latin America. Studies within these countries are also essential to better understand any inconsistencies in Apgar scoring where neonates with darker skin tones are in the majority. Additionally, despite questions around the reliability of the Apgar score for clinical decision making especially for neonates with darker skin pigmentation, its routine collection in practice means the Apgar score remains a focus of research studies. Within research there is an overemphasis on the Apgar score to classify neonatal wellbeing and to adjust within regression analyses, with little consideration of its reliability or validity. The limitations of the Apgar score, especially in those with darker skin tones needs to be more clearly understood within the research arena.

### Prediction of low APGAR score at five minutes following labor induction intervention in vaginal deliveries: machine learning approach for imbalanced data at a tertiary hospital in north tanzania [^113bkPKt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Labor induction (IOL) is a procedure in which a physician or midwife uses methods to help a pregnant woman go into labor. The factors for IOL procedure may be classified as maternal, fetal, social. IOL rates have continued to rise over the past few decades, owing to a growing focus on reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality. IOL prevalence varies greatly between countries and regions globally but developed countries have reported higher rates than developing ones. In the UK and the US, IOL accounts for about 20% of deliveries, but rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade. The IOL rate in Africa is currently at 4.4%, confirming the region's lowest rates for this important intervention. A successful IOL should lead to vaginal delivery. Recently, advances in techniques of obstetric and fetal monitoring, most induced pregnancies have favorable outcomes, however adverse health outcomes leading to low Apgar score in neonates still exist. Early detection of a low Apgar score helps ensure survival of the newborn. However, the imbalanced class distribution of pregnancy outcomes, along with the complexity of assessment, lead to bare investigations on the predictions of severely low prevalent outcomes including Apgar score following successful IOL intervention. The Apgar score is a standardized and well accepted method to measure and assess newborn's health condition immediately after delivery. Though the use of Apgar score tool to predict neonatal outcomes has been discouraged in some studies, it has been widely used to provides an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth and the response to resuscitation in Sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania. Five components assessed include heart rate, respiration, reflexes, muscle tone, and color. Each component is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. To reduce the 'noise' from the partially subjective nature of the scoring (eg, the "color" component), the pioneer of this system, Dr. Apgar, suggested categorizing the composite score as low (0–3), intermediate (4–6), and normal (7–10). However, data from a population-based study reported that Apgar scores of 7, 8, and 9 versus 10 were also associated with higher neonatal mortality and morbidity. Numerous factors, including gestational age, maternal medication and anesthesia during pregnancy and labor, congenital anomalies and interobserver variability, may affect the Apgar score. Although Apgar score may not be appropriate for predicting individual's neurological outcomes, multiple studies have looked into the relationship between Apgar score value and death or neurologic impairment in the newborn at the population level. Antenatal and peripartum adversities associated with low Apgar scores have been implicated in neonatal brain injury, which in turn may lead to neurodevelopmental disability. The first and the five-minute Apgar scores have been identified as independent predictors of neonatal morbidity and mortality; however, the five-minute score is considered to be a more accurate predictor of outcome regardless of birth weight. A low five-minute score is linked to a higher risk of neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and hyperactivity disorder later in life. Studies have shown increased risk of long term neurological disability that persist into young adulthood with intermediate Apgar scores at 5 minutes.

### The APGAR score… [^115YRMdB]. publications.aap.org (2015). Low credibility.

1 Dr Apgar subsequently published a second report that included a larger number of patients. 2 This scoring system provided a standardized assessment for infants after delivery. The Apgar score comprises 5 components: color; heart rate; reflexes; muscle tone; and respiration. Each of these components is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. Thus, the Apgar score quantitates clinical signs of neonatal depression, such as cyanosis or pallor, bradycardia, depressed reflex response to stimulation, hypotonia, and apnea or gasping respirations. The score is reported at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth for all infants, and at 5-minute intervals thereafter until 20 minutes for infants with a score less than 7. Neonatal Encephalopathy and Neurologic Outcome report defines a 5-minute Apgar score of 7 to 10 as reassuring, a score of 4 to 6 as moderately abnormal, and a score of 0 to 3 as low in the term infant and late-preterm infant.

Apgar Score and Resuscitation The 5-minute Apgar score, and particularly a change in the score between 1 minute and 5 minutes, is a useful index of the response to resuscitation. If the Apgar score is less than 7 at 5 minutes, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines state that the assessment should be repeated every 5 minutes for up to 20 minutes. 11, 12 but does not predict individual future neurologic dysfunction. Population studies have uniformly reassured us that most infants with low Apgar scores will not develop cerebral palsy. However, a low 5-minute Apgar score clearly confers an increased relative risk of cerebral palsy, reported to be as high as 20- to 100-fold over that of infants with a 5-minute Apgar score of 7 to 10. 18 It also provides a mechanism to record fetal-to-neonatal transition. Apgar scores do not predict individual mortality or adverse neurologic outcome.

However, based on population studies, Apgar scores of less than 5 at 5 and 10 minutes clearly confer an increased relative risk of cerebral palsy, and the degree of abnormality correlates with the risk of cerebral palsy.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^112ZyXXj]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

While the Apgar score may be associated with in-hospital mortality and valuable for clinical risk assessment and counseling parents regarding survival, this cohort study found a disparity in its value for longer-term outcomes and may close a gap in knowledge on the longer-term outcomes associated with low Apgar scores in this population. Our results provide support for current AAP and ILCOR recommendations to not use the Apgar score for treatment decisions, and may contribute to eliminating previous uncertainty on this topic. Future research should investigate whether initiatives to improve the utility of the Apgar score by the inclusion of further objective parameters, including ventilatory and cardiovascular interventions, can improve its predictive value. There remains an urgent need to establish precise prognostic parameters that support the clinician in the early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment to initiate therapeutic intervention programs that are known to improve the long-term outcome.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^112xe5rg]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Apgar score

Seven included studies considered the Apgar score. One of these studies considered healthcare provider training (n = 67). The remaining six studies compared an objective measure of neonatal wellbeing according to Apgar score among White infants and at least one group of infants with any other skin tone (n = 39,290,921). Of these three studies considered mortality and three considered longer term development.

Three large studies (n = 39,290,014) all linked birth-death datasets to consider neonatal mortality according to Apgar score and ethnicity. The studies included 6,544,004 neonates,25,936,357 neonatesand 6,809,653 neonatesrespectively. In all three studies, a low Apgar score (of 3 or less) was associated with increased risk of neonatal death across all ethnicities. The first studyadjusted for maternal sociodemographic and health risk factors and birthweight. Compared to neonates with a 1-min Apgar score of 7–10 those with an Apgar score of 0 to 3 had lowest odds of neonatal death if they were non-Hispanic Black (OR 20.40), with White (OR 36.21) and Mexican American neonates (OR 44.24) having increased odds of neonatal death with low Apgar score (score 0–3). The same race/ethnic variation was seen for medium 1-min scores (Apgar score 4–6). However, more Black neonates received a 1-min Apgar score of 6 or lower (10.4%), compared to of White or Mexican American neonates (7.6%). The second studywhich was low risk of bias across all domains found at the same 5-min Apgar score neonatal mortality was consistently lower in non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White neonates. The biggest difference was noted at the lowest 5-min Apgar scores (scores 1–3). This racial variation was evident for both term and preterm births. The lower risk of mortality in Black neonates with each Apgar score remained after adjusting for potential confounders including maternal smoking, education, marital status, and gestation antenatal care commenced. However, the proportion of Black neonates compared to White or Mexican American neonates receiving each 5-min Apgar score was not reported, which could have influenced these findings. The final studywas also low risk of bias across all domains. They found that compared to White neonates, Non-Hispanic Black and "Non-Hispanic other" neonates with a 5-min Apgar score of 0–3 had lower early neonatal mortality (up to 6 days of age) [Black: 45.8 per 1000 (95% CI 39.5–53.0); "Non-Hispanic other": 58.7 per 1000 (95% CI 43.7–79.1); White: 63.6 per 1000 (95% CI 58.8–68.9) respectively] and overall neonatal mortality (up to 27 days of age) [Black: 53.9 per 1000 (95% CI 43.7–61.5); "Non-Hispanic other": 65.9 per 1000 (95% CI 49.8–87.1); White: 72.4 per 1000 (95% CI 67.2–78.04) respectively]. However, the incidence of a low and intermediate Apgar score again varied by ethnicity, with low scores (Apgar score 0–3) being significantly higher in non-Hispanic Black (0.42%, n = 3931) and "non-Hispanic other" neonates (0.33%, n = 698) compared to White neonates (0.25%, n = 8,863) (p < 0.001) and intermediate scores (Apgar score 4–6) also being significantly higher in Black (1.26%, n = 11,816) and "non-Hispanic other" neonates (1.16%, n = 2464) compared to White neonates (1.02%, n = 36,144) (p < 0.001).

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^114RrN1C]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessing a newborn's condition immediately after birth is fundamental for identifying neonates requiring support during postnatal transition. Appropriate postnatal support requires skilled caregivers; thus, early identification of newborns likely to require resuscitation is crucial to provide appropriate expertise in a timely manner.

In 1953, Virginia Apgar introduced a structured postnatal assessment in order to pay attention to the baby and to detect newborns in need for support, which was later named the Apgar score and is assigned to newborns in almost every country around the world nowadays. In contrast to its worldwide application for half a century, recent guidelines do not recommend the Apgar score but recommend only certain components to assess neonatal conditions: heart rate, breathing and tone. However, neither these three components nor the entire Apgar score have been validated for their ability to sufficiently identify newborns requiring resuscitative interventions, as per recent guidelines.

Since the original Apgar score has relevant interrater variability and its components are affected by resuscitation, a specification of the five parameters was introduced a decade ago with the aim to overcome these limitations. To adapt the assessment to the current management in the delivery room, the definitions of the five items of the Apgar score were specified to document the neonatal condition independently of the measures taken to achieve this condition and with respect to gestational age.

Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended reporting interventions for neonatal resuscitation in a standardized form. This recommendation has been used to quantify resuscitative interventions in the delivery room. Both the assessment of the infant´s condition with the specified items of the Apgar score and the quantification of resuscitative interventions according to AAP and ACOG recommendations have been shown to predict the outcomes of newborns in two prospective clinical trials.

### Evaluation of interobserver agreement of APGAR scoring in preterm infants [^111ZEiGo]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Apgar scoring is accepted by medical professionals both as a measure of the infant's clinical status and the infant's response to resuscitation. Recent studies, however, have suggested significant variability when used for scoring preterm infants. We hypothesized that agreement in Apgar scoring would improve with increasing gestational age and at low levels of respiratory support. We also hypothesized that grimace and muscle tone would demonstrate the least agreement.

Methods

Neonatologists from the Perinatal Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics were presented with 4 film clip cases via a secure online survey: (1) full-term infant in room air; (2) 28 weeks' gestation infant with continuous positive airway pressure; (3) 28 weeks' gestation infant intubated; and (4) 24 weeks' gestation infant intubated. Participants were shown 30-second clips at 1, 5, and 10 minutes of life and were asked to provide Apgar scores. κ coefficients were used to compare agreement for each component.

Results

A total of 335 neonatologists participated in the survey. κ coefficients in the full-term infant for respiratory effort (0.94, 0.91), grimace (0.91, 0.90), and muscle tone (0.91, 0.89) demonstrated almost perfect agreement at 1 and 5 minutes. For preterm infants, respiratory effort (range: 0.07–0.40), muscle tone (range: 0.10–0.75), and grimace (range: 0.11–0.71) all demonstrated disagreement at 1, 5, and 10 minutes of life unless the infants were apneic and limp.

Conclusions

An improved delivery room score that decreases variability among medical care professionals is needed to accurately reflect the clinical status of preterm infants.

### APGAR scores… [^1144P6MJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In 1952, Virginia Apgar devised a scoring system whereby the prognosis for a newborn infant during the neonatal period could be estimated.

1. Her system, adopted by many centers, rated the newborn according to five objective signs: heart rate, respiratory effort, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and color. A rating of 0, 1, or 2 was given to each sign, depending on whether it was absent or present within one minute after birth. For example, a heart rate of 100 to 140 was given a score of 2; a rate of under 100 received a score of 1; and if no beat could be seen, felt, or heard, the score was 0. Likewise, an infant who cried lustily within one minute after birth was rated 2 in the respiratory category, whereas one which was apneic received a zero; all other types of respiratory effort were scored as

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^113ENTJm]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary and predominant purpose of the Apgar score has been to assess the status of an infant in the first few minutes after birth. The rationale for such a scoring system is based on the understanding that having difficulties in the transition to extrauterine life is not good for the newborn, i.e. that such difficulties are associated with worse outcomes so identifying these babies could lead to interventions that could mitigate these outcomes. This is supported by the observation that the adoption of the Apgar score did not become widespread, and then universal, until there was evidence that low scores occurred far more frequently in babies who either died or had neurological deficits in the first year of life.

Over the decades, the score has consistently been used as a risk factor in clinical studies. It has been associated not only with an increased incidence of long-term neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy and seizures, but also with a wide variety of conditions such as attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity, permanent dentition, cancer, food allergy, autism spectrum disorder, polycystic kidney disease and amblyopia. The Apgar score is used as often for research into morbidities that manifest in the post-natal period, including all the discharge diagnoses used as short-term outcomes in this current study. Short term outcomes have also been used for all studies that have examined modifications or replacements for the Apgar, and any future such efforts are likely to do the same. It is noteworthy that the NRP does not use the 1- or 5-min Apgar score.

This study used a range of morbidities occurring during the initial hospital stay to determine, first, if a low Apgar score is more frequent in those babies who were given these diagnoses compared to those without the conditions and confirmed previous associations for the risk factors and the various short-term morbidities. We confirmed that low scores at 1 or 5 minutes were significantly associated with the outcomes examined. Of the 10 outcomes and 4 low Apgar score groups, low scores were significant in 38 circumstances; the exceptions were the 5VL score for HypoG and TTNB. When other clinical factors were included in the analysis (Table 3), low scores lost their significance in an additional 9 outcome/score groups. 1L was significant for six, 5VL for eight, and 5L for six outcomes respectively.

### Five-minute APGAR score as a marker for developmental vulnerability at 5 years of age [^113oACgf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Introduced by Virginia Apgar in 1952, the Apgar score measures the health status of newborn children based on heart rate, respiration, colour, muscle tone and reflex irritability. The Apgar score at birth and 1 min after birth was initially developed to assess the immediate condition of the newborn and the potential need for resuscitation. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the 5 min Apgar score's ability to predict longer-term cognitive outcomes such as a reduced IQ, a lower numeracy and literacy score, neurological disability and low cognitive function at age 19 years. In school-age children, low Apgar scores have been linked to minor motor, language, speech and developmental impairments.

Most follow-up studies examining the long-term prognostic value of the Apgar score on child outcomes have focused on the association between extremely low 5 min Apgar scores, such as those linked to severe birth asphyxia, and distinct neurocognitive profiles such as IQ and academic ability. Virtually, no prior study has examined the developmental correlates of the Apgar score as a continuous variable, across the entire spectrum of recorded scores. In addition, there are no studies that have assessed the prognostic performance of the 5 min Apgar score for identifying developmental vulnerability among school-age children. A programme of early diagnosis could identify high-risk children who would potentially benefit from interventions designed to mitigate the developmental problems at school-going age. We, therefore, carried out a population-based study to comprehensively examine the relationship between the 5 min Apgar score and developmental vulnerability at 5 years of age.

### The APGAR score has survived the test of time [^114VCeJW]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

In 1953, Virginia Apgar, M.D. published her proposal for a new method of evaluation of the newborn infant. The avowed purpose of this paper was to establish a simple and clear classification of newborn infants which can be used to compare the results of obstetric practices, types of maternal pain relief and the results of resuscitation. Having considered several objective signs pertaining to the condition of the infant at birth she selected five that could be evaluated and taught to the delivery room personnel without difficulty. These signs were heart rate, respiratory effort, reflex irritability, muscle tone and color. Sixty seconds after the complete birth of the baby a rating of zero, one or two was given to each sign, depending on whether it was absent or present. Virginia Apgar reviewed anesthesia records of 1025 infants born alive at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center during the period of this report. All had been rated by her method. Infants in poor condition scored 0–2, infants in fair condition scored 3–7, while scores 8–10 were achieved by infants in good condition. The most favorable score 1 min after birth was obtained by infants delivered vaginally with the occiput the presenting part (average 8.4). Newborns delivered by version and breech extraction had the lowest score (average 6.3). Infants delivered by cesarean section were more vigorous (average score 8.0) when spinal was the method of anesthesia versus an average score of 5.0 when general anesthesia was used. Correlating the 60 s score with neonatal mortality, Virginia found that mature infants receiving 0, 1 or 2 scores had a neonatal death rate of 14%; those scoring 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 had a death rate of 1.1%; and those in the 8–10 score group had a death rate of 0.13%. She concluded that the prognosis of an infant is excellent if he receives one of the upper three scores, and poor if one of the lowest three scores.

### APGAR score and neonatal mortality in China: an observational study from a national surveillance system [^11459eM5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

From Jan 1, 2012, to Dec 31, 2016, the NMNMSS recorded 6,620,684 singleton live births with at least 26 completed gestational weeks. 7633 deaths occurred before the mother was discharged from the hospital, which gave a neonatal mortality rate of 0.11% after adjusting for the sampling distribution of the population.

Table 1 shows the maternal characteristics and delivery details in relation to Apgar score at 5 min. A vast majority of neonates (6,531,945, 99.66%) had a normal Apgar score at 5 min after birth. Compared with women who gave birth to infants with a normal Apgar score at 5 min (7–10), mothers of infants with a low Apgar score (0–3) or intermediate Apgar score (4–6) at 5 min were more likely to be young (under 20 years old) or of advanced maternal age (over 35 years old), to have a lower educational level, to have delivered more than once, to have received few antenatal visits, and to have used general anaesthesia during childbirth. Compared with neonates whose Apgar scores at 5 min were 7–10, neonates with low Apgar scores or intermediate Apgar scores also had a much larger proportion of non-cephalic presentation, premature birth, and low birthweight (< 2500 g).

Maternal characteristics and delivery information in relation to Apgar scores at 5 min after birth

A total of 66,542 (1.01%) cases had no information on the Apgar score at 5 min

*These hospitals did not get level certification

Among new-borns with low Apgar scores at 5 min whose mothers had direct obstetric complications, nearly half of them died (Fig. 1). Among new-borns with low Apgar scores whose mothers had medical diseases, the proportion of neonatal deaths was close to 1/3. Among neonatal deaths with low Apgar scores, almost half of their mothers had neither direct obstetric complications nor medical diseases. In the intermediate Apgar group, these proportions were much lower.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^115bqXay]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The Apgar score was originally developed by Virginia Apgar in 1953 for the standardized evaluation of the newborn infant's clinical condition at 1 minute after birth and the need for resuscitation measures. Although it was not the developer's intention to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes, Apgar scores at 5 and 10 minutes of life were later found to be associated with mortality and acute morbidities in infants born at term. After the Apgar score's original description, advances in medical care have dramatically improved neonatal outcomes. Nonetheless, the Apgar score remains the most commonly used assessment tool, and low Apgar scores at 5 minutes after birth are uniformly associated with an increased risk of mortality, acute morbidities, impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes, and educational support services in infants born at term.,

A similar association of low 5-minute Apgar scores after birth and increased risks of mortality and cerebral palsy (CP) was observed in infants born preterm, although the strength of the association decreased at lower gestational ages. A 2022 studyby a multinational collaboration did not reveal an association between low Apgar scores and severe neurologic injury, defined as grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or cystic periventricular leukomalacia (CPVL), in infants born extremely preterm (EPT; ie, those born at less than 28 weeks' gestation). These results raise questions about the association between the Apgar score and neurodevelopmental outcomes in this high-risk population given that these brain lesions constitute the main risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental impairment.,

Overall, the prognostic accuracy of the Apgar score for longer-term outcomes in infants born EPT has not been conclusively studied to our knowledge. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between low Apgar scores at 5 minutes of life and cognitive and motor outcomes at age 5 years among children born EPT within the population-based Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe-Screening to Improve Health in Very Preterm Infants in Europe (EPICE-SHIPS) cohort.

### Resuscitating neonates: 65 years after Virginia APGAR [^116pkanF]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

The work of O'Donnell et al shows that, almost 65 years after Virginia Apgar influential work, researchers still have 'imaginative ideas and enthusiasm' on that topic. As a consequence, the amount of 'precise data' has substantially increased over the years and delivery room management has become 'evidence-based' science in the past decade.

Even Virginia Apgar's score has been modified and adapted to meet the demands of modern neonatal care. Based on the large interobserver variability of the Apgar score that has been described by O'Donnell and other authors, it was already asked whether the Apgar score is 'ready for retirement'. The major reason for large variations was a lack of consensus on how to score preterms or infants receiving any interventions. As a consequence, an infant with respiratory support was either scored 0 — since it requires support, 1 — since it had a disturbed respiration or 2 — since it had sufficient respiration due to the ventilator support. Surprisingly, despite the missing agreement, the Apgar score was (and is still) used in most industrialised countries every day to describe infant's condition in a clinical context and for research purposes. To overcome the limitations, the score has been adapted to meet requirements of modern delivery room management. The resulting CAspecifies the five well-known items of the original score to described infant's condition as a result of the interventions (table 1). It further adds 7 points for interventions that are required to achieve the described condition. Finally, the CAhas been tested and proven to be useful in two clinical trials in preterm and term infants. As a consequence, there is no need for retirement of Apgar's 'imaginative idea' but for an integration of her score into the modern concept of supporting neonatal transition.

### APGAR score and risk of neonatal death among preterm infants [^1121jNFq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Gestational age is the major determinant of neonatal death (death within the first 28 days of life) in preterm infants. The joint effect of gestational age and Apgar score on the risk of neonatal death is unknown.

Methods

Using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, we identified 113,300 preterm infants (22 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 6 days of gestation) born from 1992 through 2016. In analyses stratified according to gestational age (22 to 24 weeks, 25 to 27 weeks, 28 to 31 weeks, 32 to 34 weeks, and 35 or 36 weeks), we estimated adjusted relative risks of neonatal death and absolute rate differences in neonatal mortality (i.e., the excess number of neonatal deaths per 100 births) according to the Apgar scores at 5 and 10 minutes and according to the change in the Apgar score between 5 minutes and 10 minutes. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a better physical condition of the newborn.

Results

There were 1986 neonatal deaths (1.8%). The incidence of neonatal death ranged from 0.2% (at 36 weeks of gestation) to 76.5% (at 22 weeks of gestation). Lower Apgar scores were associated with higher relative risks of neonatal death and greater absolute rate differences in neonatal mortality in all gestational-age strata. For example, among infants born at 28 to 31 weeks, the adjusted absolute rate differences according to the 5-minute Apgar score, with those who had a score of 9 or 10 serving as the reference group, were 51.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 38.1 to 65.4) for a score of 0 or 1, 25.5 (95% CI, 18.3 to 32.8) for a score of 2 or 3, 7.1 (95% CI, 5.1 to 9.1) for a score of 4 to 6, and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.9) for a score of 7 or 8. An increase in the Apgar score between 5 minutes and 10 minutes was associated with lower neonatal mortality than a stable Apgar score.

Conclusions

In this study, Apgar scores at 5 and 10 minutes provided prognostic information about neonatal survival among preterm infants across gestational-age strata. (Funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life, and Welfare and Karolinska Institutet.).

### Performance of a maternal risk stratification system for predicting low APGAR scores [^111ZQeUu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Maternal risk stratification systems are increasingly employed in predicting and preventing obstetric complications. These systems focus primarily on maternal morbidity, and few tools exist to stratify neonatal risk. We sought to determine if a maternal risk stratification score was associated with neonatal morbidity.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study of patients with liveborn infants born at ≥ 24 weeks at four hospitals in one health system between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. The Expanded Obstetric Comorbidity Score (EOCS) is used as the maternal risk score. The primary neonatal outcome was 5-minute Apgar < 7. Logistic regression models determined associations between EOCS and neonatal morbidity. Secondary analyses were performed, including stratifying outcomes by gestational age and limiting analysis to "low-risk" term singletons. Model discrimination assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and calibration via calibration plots.

Results

A total of 14,497 maternal-neonatal pairs were included; 236 (1.6%) had 5-minute Apgar < 7; EOCS was higher in 5-minute Apgar < 7 group (median 41 vs. 11, p < 0.001). AUC for EOCS in predicting Apgar < 7 was 0.72 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.68, 0.75), demonstrating relatively good discrimination. Calibration plot revealed that those in the highest EOCS decile had higher risk of neonatal morbidity (7.6 vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001). When stratified by gestational age, discrimination weakened with advancing gestational age: AUC 0.70 for < 28 weeks, 0.63 for 28 to 31 weeks, 0.64 for 32 to 36 weeks, and 0.61 for ≥ 37 weeks. When limited to term low-risk singletons, EOCS had lower discrimination for predicting neonatal morbidity and was not well calibrated.

Conclusion

A maternal morbidity risk stratification system does not perform well in most patients giving birth, at low risk for neonatal complications. The findings suggest that the association between EOCS and 5-minute Apgar < 7 likely reflects a relationship with prematurity. This study cautions against intentional or unintentional extrapolation of maternal morbidity risk for neonatal risk, especially for term deliveries.

Key Points

· EOCS had moderate discrimination for Apgar < 7. · Predictive performance declined when limited to low-risk term singletons. · Relationship between EOCS and Apgar < 7 was likely driven by prematurity.

### The APGAR score [^112GmSSy]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The Apgar score provides an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth and the response to resuscitation if needed. The Apgar score alone cannot be considered as evidence of, or a consequence of, asphyxia; does not predict individual neonatal mortality or neurologic outcome; and should not be used for that purpose. An Apgar score assigned during resuscitation is not equivalent to a score assigned to a spontaneously breathing infant. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourage use of an expanded Apgar score reporting form that accounts for concurrent resuscitative interventions.

### The continuing value of the APGAR score for the assessment of newborn infants [^112pXStv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

The 10-point Apgar score has been used to assess the condition and prognosis of newborn infants throughout the world for almost 50 years. Some investigators have proposed that measurement of pH in umbilical-artery blood is a more objective method of assessing newborn infants.

Methods

We carried out a retrospective cohort analysis of 151,891 live-born singleton infants without malformations who were delivered at 26 weeks of gestation or later at an inner-city public hospital between January 1988 and December 1998. Paired Apgar scores and umbilical-artery blood pH values were determined for 145,627 infants to assess which test best predicted neonatal death during the first 28 days after birth.

Results

For 13,399 infants born before term (at 26 to 36 weeks of gestation), the neonatal mortality rate was 315 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 5 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. For 132,228 infants born at term (37 weeks of gestation or later), the mortality rate was 244 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 0.2 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. The risk of neonatal death in term infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3 (relative risk, 1460; 95 percent confidence interval, 835 to 2555) was eight times the risk in term infants with umbilical-artery blood pH values of 7.0 or less (180; 95 percent confidence interval, 97 to 334).

Conclusions

The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was almost 50 years ago.

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^1174zv1D]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first to evaluate whether specified items of an infant's condition immediately after birth predicts the need for subsequent resuscitative interventions in modern neonatology. We demonstrated that the need for and extent of support can be predicted by assessing an infant's condition at one minute of life, with heart rate, chest movement and reflexes being the most important features. Furthermore, the infant's condition at one minute identifies the need either for caregivers experienced in basic neonatal life support or for more experienced caregivers since rare interventions might be necessary within the next minutes.

Interpretation

The identification of newborns in need of extensive resuscitation is important since it is a rare event among newborn infants. Since the level of experience among care providers for very preterm infants might vary in between centers and internationally, an early identification of newborns requiring rare interventions is therefore important.

Current resuscitation guidelines utilize three components of the infant's condition (respiration, heart rate and tone) to identify newborns likely needing resuscitation; however, scientific evidence to support these recommendations is lacking. Our analysis is the first to assess how good single items of infant's condition predict the extent of subsequent resuscitation. To overcome the limitations of the conventional approach to describe an infant's condition, such as high interrater variability of the Apgar score and interference with resuscitative interventions, we used a well-evaluated specification of the single items of the Apgar score. The specified Apgar score has the advantage of describing an infant's condition even during ongoing resuscitative interventions and regardless of gestational age. The particular definitions used for the specified Apgar score should be considered by the caregiver. Furthermore, the extent of neonatal resuscitation was quantified in accordance with the recommendations of the AAP and ACOG. Since the seven most important resuscitative interventions were quantified in a standardized manner, we were able to analyze how good the need for single interventions (such as chest compressions) is predicted by the infant's condition (regardless if interventions are performed or not at the time of assessment).

### Stillbirths and very low APGAR scores among vaginal births in a tertiary hospital in Ghana: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis [^112khsDL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Over 3 million stillbirths occur globally each year, nearly all of which are in low-income countries. Stillbirth rates are particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa, where up to 14% of deliveries could result in stillbirths. These rates are relatively higher in West Africa. Apgar scores are used to assess the condition of the newborn in the first critical minutes of life and can be useful in evaluating neonatal resuscitation and survival, especially in low resource settings. About 8–38% of babies delivered in West Africa may have low Apgar scores. Over two-thirds of babies with very low Apgar scores may result in perinatal mortality. Stillbirths and Apgar scores are important indicators of the quality of obstetric care. Non-infectious maternal and obstetric risk factors for stillbirths that are likely to be important in sub-Saharan Africa include socio-demographic and reproductive factors, hypertensive states in pregnancy, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and type of vaginal delivery. For example, preterm births and low birth weight infants are associated with increased risks of stillbirths, and nearly a fifth of such babies are stillborn.

The vaginal route remains the commonest mode of delivery in all health care facilities. A few studies have reported the prevalence of adverse birth outcomes and the maternal and reproductive factors associated with these outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. However, data regarding the contribution of socio-demographic and obstetric risk factors to stillbirths and very low Apgar scores of babies delivered vaginally remains very sparse. Increasing attention for these factors and focusing on interventions to reduce adverse vaginal birth outcomes will contribute immensely towards the attainment of Millennium Development Goal 4 on under-five mortality.

The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of stillbirths and very low Apgar scores among vaginal births in a tertiary health facility in Ghana, and examine the socio-demographic and obstetric factors associated with these adverse vaginal birth outcomes.

### Nine is the new ten of APGAR scores: an observational retrospective cohort study [^116XnyJe]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Apgar scores of 10 were once common but are now rare. We aggregated scores from US term infants from 1978 to 2021. We found that scores of 10 decreased by logarithmic decay independent of demographic changes. We hypothesize that this trend was driven by improved appreciation of transitional physiology.

### Use and abuse of the APGAR score… [^117LpKT4]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The Apgar score, devised in 1952 by Dr Virginia Apgar, is a quick method of assessing the state of the newborn infant. 1, 2 The ease of scoring has led to its use in many studies of outcome. However, its misuse, as in current International Classification of Diseases, revision 9, coding, has led to an erroneous definition of asphyxia. * Although the Apgar score continues to provide a convenient shorthand for reporting the state of the baby and the effectiveness of resuscitation, the purpose of this statement is to place the Apgar score in its proper perspective as a tool for assessing asphyxia and for prognostication of future neurologic deficit. The Apgar score is comprised of five components: heart rate, respiratory effort, tone, reflex irritability, and color, each of which can be given a score of 0, 1, or 2.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE APGAR SCORE Although rarely stated, it is important to recognize that elements of the score such as tone, color, and reflex irritability are partially dependent on the physiologic maturity of the infant. The normal premature infant may thus receive a low score purely because of immaturity with no evidence of anoxic insult or cerebral depression. Maternal sedation or analgesia may decrease tone and responsiveness. Neurologic conditions such as muscle disease or cerebral malformations may decrease tone and interfere with respiration. Cardiorespiratory conditions may interfere with heart rate, respiration, and tone. Thus, to equate the presence of a low Apgar score solely with asphyxia represents a misuse of the score.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^115aNeGn]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Since an objective description is essential to determine infant's postnatal condition and efficacy of interventions, two scores were suggested in the past but weren't tested yet: The Specified-Apgar uses the 5 items of the conventional Apgar score; however describes the condition regardless of gestational age (GA) or resuscitative interventions. The Expanded-Apgar measures interventions needed to achieve this condition. We hypothesized that the combination of both (Combined-Apgar) describes postnatal condition of preterm infants better than either of the scores alone.

Methods

Scores were assessed in preterm infants below 32 completed weeks of gestation. Data were prospectively collected in 20 NICU in 12 countries. Prediction of poor outcome (death, severe/moderate BPD, IVH, CPL and ROP) was used as a surrogate parameter to compare the scores. To compare predictive value the AUC for the ROC was calculated.

Results

Of 2150 eligible newborns, data on 1855 infants with a mean GA of 28(6/7) ± 2(3/7) weeks were analyzed. At 1 minute, the Combined-Apgar was significantly better in predicting poor outcome than the Specified- or Expanded-Apgar alone. Of infants with a very low score at 5 or 10 minutes 81% or 100% had a poor outcome, respectively. In these infants the relative risk (RR) for perinatal mortality was 24.93 (13.16–47.20) and 31.34 (15.91–61.71), respectively.

Conclusion

The Combined-Apgar allows a more appropriate description of infant's condition under conditions of modern neonatal care. It should be used as a tool for better comparison of group of infants and postnatal interventions.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^1147z1aB]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Data

After birth, the following data were collected by the attending neonatologist: gestational age, birth weight, mode of delivery and a description of the infant at 1, 5 and 10 minutes of life according to the definition of the Combined-Apgar, which consists of the Expanded-Apgar and Specified-Apgar as shown in Table 1:

Table 1
Combined-Apgar consisting of the Expanded-Apgar and Specified-Apgar

Specified-Apgar: Muscle tone and reflex response were evaluated in relation to GA as being appropriate (2 points), reduced (1 point) or absent (0 points). Chest movement was evaluated regardless of the respiratory support given and was scored 2 if chest movements were appropriate, with 1 point if chest movements were reduced, irregular or signs of respiratory distress were present, and scored 0 if no chest movement was present. Skin color and heart frequency were evaluated as detailed in Table 1, regardless of the intervention needed to achieve this condition.
Expanded-Apgar: Presence or absence of the following interventions was evaluated: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oxygen supplementation, bag and mask ventilation, intubation and ventilation, chest compression, administration of surfactant, epinephrine (drugs). If an intervention was performed it was scored 0, if absent it was scored 1. The best possible score was 7 (no intervention) and the worst 0 (all interventions performed). Intubated and ventilated infants were scored 0 for CPAP as well as for bag and mask ventilation; infants on bag and mask ventilation were scored 0 for CPAP as well.
Combined-Apgar: In clinical routine, the Combined-Apgar will consist of two numbers, such as 7–10 for the Expanded- and Specified-Apgar, respectively (Table 1). For the purpose of the present study, the Combined-Apgar was calculated as the sum of the Specified- and the Expanded-Apgar.

At discharge the following outcome measures were recorded: mode of discharge (death, transfer to another hospital, or home), length of stay, corrected GA, weight, and the presence of either of the four major morbidities: moderate/severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage grade 1–4 (IVH), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (CPL), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^116WTqJo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Ethics Approval

This cohort study used data from the prospective population-based EPICE study, which enrolled all stillbirths and live births from 22 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks' gestation across 19 regions of 11 European countries for a 12-month period between April 2011 and September 2012 with the exception of the French region, where data collection occurred over 6 months. Ethics approval was obtained from regional or hospital ethics committees as required by national legislation. The European study was approved by the French Advisory Committee on Use of Health Data in Medical Research and the French National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties. This ethical approval covers analyses of perinatal determinants of neurodevelopment at 5 years, including this study. Parental informed consent was obtained for the SHIPS study on follow-up at age 5 years, which includes analyses of sociodemographic and perinatal determinants of child development and well-being. This study adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for observational studies.

Obstetric and neonatal baseline and outcome data up to discharge home from the neonatal unit were retrieved from patient records using a standardized questionnaire with pretested definitions. At age 5 years, children born at less than 28 weeks' gestation were offered a standardized clinical assessment evaluating neurocognitive and motor functioning using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–Revised, Third, or Fourth Edition depending on locally normed tests and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children–Second Edition (MABC-2). Assessments were executed by local routine follow-up programs or the SHIPS research team depending on the organization of follow-up in each country. For all children in the cohort, caregivers filled in a questionnaire that included 2 domains (the communication and problem-solving domains) of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition (ASQ-3). Further information on family characteristics and child health status was obtained by this parental questionnaire.

Study Population

The population for this analysis included all children born EPT in the cohort with follow-up at age 5 years born between 22 and 27 weeks' gestation. The EPT subgroup was selected because of the availability of standardized clinical assessments of cognitive and motor function.

Exposure

Our exposure was the Apgar score at 5 minutes of life. We classified Apgar scores into 4 categories based on commonly used cutoffs (0–3, 4–6, 7–8, and 9–10 points) to enable comparison with other studies.

### The contribution of low APGAR scores in identifying neonates with short-term morbidities in a large single center cohort [^116XksPd]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis

Because of the well-documented variability in Apgar scoring across countries, individuals and by newborn conditions, we chose to use cut-off scores at both one and 5 min. The most common definition of significance in the 2018–19 review was a total score of less than or equal to 6 while a score of less than or equal to 3 has been commonly used to identify possible asphyxia. We therefore defined four Apgar score groups: 1 L (1 min ≤ 6), 1VL (1 min ≤ 3), 5 L (5 min ≤ 6), and 5VL (5 min ≤ 3) We did not use any scores beyond 5 min because it was generally only done when the previous scores were low, which creates a likely selection bias for this data.

The sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive value as well as odds ratio for the four low Apgar scores were calculated for each short-term morbidity. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed for each morbidity using each of the low Apgar scores and gestational age by week, gender, race, mode of delivery, and whether they were SGA. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated for all models. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the multivariable models were calculated with and without each low Apgar score and the differences in the area under the curve (AUC) when each was included or omitted was calculated. For comparison, a similar analysis was done using the Apgar score first and then adding in the clinical factors. Statistical significance between these AUCs was calculated DeLong's test.

### APGAR score in the United States, 1978 stacks… [^115vpKsG]. stacks.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Apgar score in the United States, 1978 Public Domain May 6, 1981 Series: Monthly Vital Statistics Reports File Language: English. Details Personal Author: Corporate Authors: Description: The Apgar score was developed in 1952 by Virginia Apgar, M. D., as a means of evaluating the physical condition of an infant at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. It is an indication of the need for immediate medical attention and a predictor of the infant's chances of surviving the first year of life. The scoring system was developed to predict survival; to compare the results of different methods of resuscitation; to compare the results of care received at different hospitals; to evaluate the results of obstetrical practices such as induction of labor, elective cesarean section, and maternal anesthesia and analgesia; and to insure closer observation of the infant during the first minutes of life. mv30_01s. pdf Subjects: Source: Monthly vital statistics report; v. 230, no. 1, suppl.; DHEW publication; no. 81–1120 Series: Document Type: Genre: Place as Subject: Pages in Document: 8 Pages Collection: Main Document Checksum: urn: sha-512: 435350947da3bf217c7982e9f716521734a82ab921545525077d6e84a5ef7bead9c6f554ae1a2bd2c4dabaab29fe3e64e151c7768b3d64bd1968d451c5efc35a.

### APGAR score and neonatal mortality in China: an observational study from a national surveillance system [^116cycwn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

A low Apgar score at 5 min was strongly associated with neonatal mortality (adjusted RR 126.50, 95% CI 107.35–149.06), and an intermediate Apgar score at 5 min was also associated with neonatal mortality (adjusted RR 30.27, 95% CI 26.11–35.10). However, the effect of the Apgar score was even stronger when scores at 1 and 5 min were combined (Table 3). Compared with that in the groups with scores of 7–10 at both 1 and 5 min, the risk for neonatal death increased by over 200-fold in both groups with scores of 3 or lower. Even new-borns who recovered from a low Apgar score at 1 min to a normal Apgar score at 5 min had a nearly 13-fold increased risk of neonatal death compared with those with normal scores at both 1 and 5 min.

### Factors associated with recovery from 1 minute APGAR score [^111JBKrV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The most consistently used measure of neonatal health in the few minutes after delivery is the Apgar score, providing labor ward staff with a shared understanding of a newborn's status, and the possible need for and response to resuscitation. The assessment is usually made a number of times within the first ten minutes of birth, usually at 1, 5, and 10 min.

Research has generally focused on the Apgar score at 5 min, and more specifically the relationship between the Apgar score at 5 min and future neonatal and infant outcomes. There appears to have been little or no research examining the relationship between the Apgar score at 1 min and the Apgar score at 5 min. While the Apgar score at 5 min is a better predictor of later outcomes than the Apgar score at 1 min, there is a necessary temporal process involved, and a neonate must pass through the first minute of life to reach the fifth. Understanding the factors associated with the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, particularly for neonates with 1 min Apgar scores < 4, has the potential to improve care.

The major difference between the Apgar assessment at 1 and 5 min is that the Apgar assessment within the first minute of birth provides an indication of intrapartum health and the neonatal response to the "trauma" of birth. A 1 min Apgar score < 4 is likely to trigger a range of protocols which may (or may not) lead to resuscitative intervention. The Apgar assessment at 5 min provides an indication of a neonate's sustained capacity to survive and thrive. It is for this reason that the second Apgar assessment, made at 5 min, is a better predictor of later outcomes than the Apgar score at 1 min (7).

For a neonate with an initially poor Apgar score, the difference between the 1st and 5th minute Apgar scores indicates the capacity to recover and the potential need for ongoing management. Variation in recovery rates between the first and fifth minute provides significant clinical information and may, furthermore, provide insight into health systems issues in the intrapartum window. Understanding the factors associated with the transition between the scores, particularly for neonates with 1 min Apgar scores < 4 has the potential to bring into relief points for intervention or further investigation. With a focus on term, newborns with low one minute Apgar scores, we examine:
The patterns of Apgar score change in newborns from 1 to 5 min; and
The factors associated with recovery from a 1 min Apgar score < 4;

### Association between APGAR scores of 7 to 9 and neonatal mortality and morbidity: population based cohort study of term infants in Sweden [^117NAvx6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The most routinely used measure of health status of newborns is the Apgar score, typically quantified at 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth. Our recent population based studies have shown that non-malformed term infants born with lower Apgar scores within the normal range (7 to 9) at 1, 5, or 10 minutes are at higher risk of adverse long term outcomes, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, having additional needs, and adverse child developmental health (compared with non-malformed term infants with an Apgar score of 10). Both the timing and the score are important: compared with an Apgar score of 10 at 5 and 10 minutes, an Apgar score of 9 at 5 minutes and an Apgar score of 9 at 10 minutes are both associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy, with an Apgar score of 9 at 10 minutes conferring higher risk of cerebral palsy than an Apgar score of 9 at 5 minutes.

The findings of differential risks associated with Apgar scores within the normal range are unexpected as it is commonly assumed that Apgar scores of 9 versus 10 are assigned arbitrarily. This belief is supported by international comparisons of Apgar scores, which show that the frequency of Apgar scores of 10 at 5 minutes vary from 8.8% in some countries to 92.7% in others. It is widely recognised that a low Apgar score, commonly defined as a score less than 7, is associated with increased risks of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long term outcomes; however, no previous study has investigated whether Apgar scores of 7, 8, and 9 are similarly associated with higher risks of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Quantifying associations between Apgar scores in the normal range and neonatal morbidity, such as neonatal infections, neonatal respiratory distress, and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy is important because such conditions are known risk factors for later neurodevelopmental adversity in children. In this population based study of more than 1.5 million infants born in Sweden, we evaluated associations between Apgar scores of 7, 8, and 9 (versus 10) at 1, 5, or 10 minutes and risks of neonatal mortality and morbidity.

### Low APGAR score and risk of neonatal mortality among infants with birth defects [^112WX3jv]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Apgar score is a clinical tool to assess newborn health at delivery and has shown utility in predicting neonatal mortality in the general population, but its predictive ability in neonates with birth defects remains unexplored. As such, we aimed to investigate the performance of the 5-minute Apgar score in predicting neonatal mortality among neonates with a spectrum of major birth defects. Data for neonates with birth defects born between 1999 and 2017 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defect Registry. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values for neonatal mortality (death within the first 28 days of life) by 5-minute Apgar score (< 7 vs. ≥ 7) to measure discrimination capacity. We performed secondary analyses to determine the predictive ability of the Apgar score: (1) among infants with an isolated birth defect and (2) separately in preterm and term neonates. Low Apgar score yielded substantial predictive ability for neonatal mortality, with 25 out of 26 AUC values > 0.70 across a spectrum of defect categories. High predictive ability was consistent among neonates with isolated defects, and preterm and term neonates. The Apgar score is likely useful for predicting neonatal mortality among most neonates with birth defects. Despite small sample sizes limiting some secondary analyses, the findings emphasize the potential continued use of the Apgar score as a rapid clinical assessment tool for newborns with birth defects. Continued research may refine the Apgar score's application in this important population, both in clinical practice and population health research. · Predictive models suggest the 5-minute Apgar score (< 7) is predictive of neonatal mortality. · Consistent results were observed across spectrum of birth defect categories. · Secondary analyses (e.g., preterm infants) yielded similarly consistent results.

### Congenital heart defects and APGAR score at birth, a nationwide study [^114dYtoq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) remain the largest group of major congenital anomalies with a prevalence of approximately 6 infants per 1000 live births. The number of deaths related to CHD has decreased in recent years due to improved clinical practice, and approximately 50% of infants with CHD are diagnosed prenatally. Despite early diagnosis and surgery, CHD continues to be a common cause of childhood morbidity, including neurodevelopmental disorders and death. In fact, up to half of the children with CHD have been reported to exhibit signs of neurologic impairments.,

The Apgar score is an internationally recognized scoring system for a structured clinical assessment of the physical condition of the newborn during the fetal‐to‐neonatal transition and evaluates 5 physiological characteristics including appearance (color), pulse (heart rate), grimace (reflex irritability), activity (muscle tone), and respiration (respiratory effort). Three of these are measures of neurology (tone, reflexes, respiration), and 2 are related to the circulation (heart rate, color). Each characteristic is routinely assigned a score of 0 to 2 after 1, 5, and 10 minutes (Table 1). A total score at or above 7 is considered normal at 5 minutes. Whereas the Apgar score is known to have a suboptimal predictive value for the subsequent development of neurologic outcomes at the individual level, a low Apgar of < 7 at 5 minutes has been linked to low IQ scores; poor school performances; and an increased risk of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and intellectual disability in children. The Apgar score is the most common and widely available measure of the fetal‐to‐neonatal transition.

Table 1
Overview of the Apgar Scoring System

Previous studies have documented that fetuses and newborns with CHD exhibit signs of delayed brain maturation, which may render the children more susceptible to brain injury from influences during birth and the neonatal transition. In line with this, a few studies have indicated associations between a low Apgar score after 5 minutes, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental disorders in this large group of children. Moreover, CHD has been associated with numerous other factors associated with low Apgar scores, including preeclampsia; preterm birth; and impaired fetal, placental, and prenatal cerebral growth. However, the relation between specific subtypes of CHD and a low Apgar score remains unknown. The identification of subtypes of CHD at risk for complicated fetal‐to‐neonatal transition holds the potential to improve both perinatal and neonatal care as well as long‐term neurodevelopment in this patient group.

### Documentation of mandated birth certificate data elements across US birth settings [^111s2hBw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The 5-minute Apgar score assesses 5 critical indicators of neonatal well-being: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and skin color. Federal law mandates national collection and publication of births and other vital statistics data. This cross-sectional analysis evaluated documentation rates of select birth certificate elements, including the 5-minute Apgar score, across birth settings to assess compliance with federal requirements and identify potential documentation gaps.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^117R43PT]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The Apgar score is used worldwide as an assessment tool to estimate the vitality of newborns in their first minutes of life. Its applicability to estimate neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born extremely preterm (EPT; < 28 weeks' gestation) is not well established.

Objective

To investigate the association between the Apgar score and neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born EPT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted using data from the Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe-Screening to Improve Health in Very Preterm Infants in Europe (EPICE-SHIPS) study, a population-based cohort in 19 regions of 11 European countries in 2011 to 2012. Clinical assessments of cognition and motor function at age 5 years were performed in infants born EPT and analyzed in January to July 2023.

Exposures

Apgar score at 5 minutes of life categorized into 4 groups (0–3, 4–6, 7–8, and 9–10 points).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cognitive and motor outcomes were assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test of IQ derived from locally normed versions by country and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition. Parents additionally provided information on communication and problem-solving skills using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition (ASQ-3). All outcomes were measured as continuous variables.

Results

From the total cohort of 4395 infants born EPT, 2522 infants were live born, 1654 infants survived to age 5 years, and 996 infants (478 females [48.0%]) followed up had at least 1 of 3 outcome measures. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, perinatal factors, and severe neonatal morbidities, there was no association of Apgar score with IQ, even for scores of 3 or less (β = -3.3; 95% CI, -10.5 to 3.8) compared with the score 9 to 10 category. Similarly, no association was found for ASQ-3 (β = -2.1; 95% CI, -24.6 to 20.4). Congruent results for Apgar scores of 3 or less were obtained for motor function scores for all children (β = -4.0; 95% CI, -20.1 to 12.1) and excluding children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (β = 0.8, 95% CI -11.7 to 13.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that low Apgar scores were not associated with longer-term outcomes in infants born EPT. This finding may be associated with high interobserver variability in Apgar scoring, reduced vitality signs and poorer responses to resuscitation after birth among infants born EPT, and the association of more deleterious exposures in the neonatal intensive care unit or of socioeconomic factors with greater changes in outcomes during the first 5 years of life.

### Outcomes of neonates with a 10-min APGAR score of zero: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rvfrh]. Neonatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Apgar score is a standardized method of assessing the primary adaptation and clinical status of a neonate after birth. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze the survival and the survival without moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) of neonates with a 10-min Apgar score of zero.

Methods

Six electronic databases were searched for reports published until November 2021 of neonates with a 10-min Apgar score of zero. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for case series/reports. Meta-analyses of the proportion of outcomes were conducted using a random-effects model for studies published after year 2000 and reporting > 5 neonates. Meta-regression using the median year of the study period and subgroup analyses by treatment with therapeutic hypothermia and by gestational age were conducted.

Results

Twenty-eight studies of 820 neonates with moderate risk of bias were included. Survival was 40% (95% confidence interval 30–50%, 16 studies, 646 neonates, I2 = 83%), and it increased by 2.3% per year (95% CI 1.3–3.2%, p < 0.001). Survival without moderate-to-severe NDI was 19% (95% confidence interval 11–27%, 13 studies, 211 neonates, I2 = 62%). Survival was higher for neonates who received therapeutic hypothermia and for those with a gestational age ≥ 32 weeks compared to < 32 weeks.

Conclusion

Approximately 2 in 5 neonates with a 10-min Apgar score of zero survived, and 1 in 5 survive without moderate-to-severe NDI survived. Survival has improved over the years, especially since the era of therapeutic hypothermia.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^112E5AKA]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The Apgar score distribution in our cohort was comparable to those in other large cohorts of EPT births. Our data are congruent with results from the International Neonatal Consortium analysis, in which no increased risk for IVH or CPVL was observed in association with low Apgar scores that constitute established associations with impairments in neurodevelopmental outcome. Of note, low Apgar scores have been associated with CP, as also found in a 2023 study from our cohort. In line with these findings, estimated coefficients were lower when children with CP were removed from our study. We also found significance for motor function when comparing groups with Apgar scores of 0 to 3 with those with scores of 9 to 10 in sensitivity analyses without IPW, which could reflect this association. Findings for IQ were robust in sensitivity analyses. Nonetheless, some estimates had wide CIs because of smaller numbers of children born with very low Apgar scores.

Our results stand in contrast to the documented association of low Apgar scores with neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born at term. However, the most recent multicenter studies and meta-analyses, substantiate the concerns of opponents of using low Apgar score values to estimate neurodevelopmental disability given that even an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes of life was a poor estimator, with at least half of surviving children having no disability or a mild disability. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement does not recommend the application of the Apgar score for resuscitation initiation and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines withdrew the suitability of the Apgar score as criterion to discontinue resuscitation measures in infants who are postnatally depressed. Furthermore, it is common research practice to consider the combined outcome of mortality and neurodevelopmental impairment. Our data indicate that it is important to separately consider the probability to survive and the chance for a life without severe impairment.

### Neonatal resuscitation and adaptation score vs Apgar: newborn assessment and predictive ability [^1148H21W]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the non-inferiority of an alternative to the Apgar score.

Study Design

The Neonatal Resuscitation and Adaptation Score (NRAS) was recorded in parallel to the Apgar score by a resuscitation team at deliveries. Correlation between the systems was assessed, as well as the predictive ability of NRAS and Apgar scores for mortality or short-term morbidities.

Results

A total of 340 infants were in the study group. The two scores correlated strongly (r = 0.87 and 0.83 at 1 and 5min, respectively). Those needing ventilation at 48h of life had a 5-min NRAS < 7 in 23/26 vs Apgar < 7 (23/36, p = 0.001). A low (0–3) 1-min NRAS score was more predictive of death, 53% vs 17%, p = 0.0065.

Conclusions

NRAS correlates with Apgar status assessment, and identifies newborns who die or may require further care better than the Apgar score.

### Assessing the postnatal condition: the predictive value of single items of the APGAR score [^115u2zer]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

A great strength of our analysis is that it is based on a large sample size. Furthermore, the studies were performed in a prospective multicenter design, and strict methods to quantify infant's clinical condition and extent of resuscitation were used. Nevertheless, our results are based on a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. The two original studies did only include newborns with a high likelihood to receive resuscitative interventions. Patients between 32 and 37 weeks of gestational age were not included. The distribution of our population represents the patients that are resuscitated with about 90% being preterm and 10% being born term. Since the analysis uses infant's condition regardless of gestational age, we believe that the results are also applicable to preterm infants between 32 and 37 weeks as well. Their clinical signs and physiological responses do not differ from other newborns. Information on cord management was not recorded in both trials. Immediate cord clamping was most likely performed in some infants and potentially influenced Apgar scores. Since the different components of the Apgar score and neonatal interventions are not affected by the cord clamping strategy, the impact on the study question is low. Heart rate was determined as per standard protocol of the units, most likely primarily per auscultation, which is in accordance with the guidelines. Not all infants received an ECG since we recorded data reflecting routine care, which is a strength of our study. Muscle tone and reflexes were judged by the caregiver regarding their appropriateness for gestational age. This judgement is subjective but more defined as the original Apgar score although the interrater variability has not been formally tested yet.

Despite these limitations, our data are of great clinical relevance. We can provide an evidence-based approach to predict the need for subsequent resuscitative interventions in newborns within the first minute of life. Our results require the assessment of the newborn using the specified scoring system. Low scores in heart rate, reflexes and chest movement are the strongest predictors of advanced resuscitative interventions.

If all five items of the specified Apgar score are used at one minute, infants with a score higher than 7 are less likely to require advanced interventions of neonatal resuscitation (intubation, chest compression or epinephrine). However, infants with a score less than 5 are likely to need special neonatal expertise for more complex resuscitative interventions. To ease the newborn's assessment, it would be sufficient to evaluate heart rate, reflexes and chest movement with comparable predictive value. In this case, a score of 2 or lower identifies infants likely needing special neonatal experience for the more complex interventions.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^115eNywp]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Study Population and Apgar Score Distribution

Of 4395 total EPT births in the cohort, 2522 infants were live born; 851 deaths occurred during the neonatal hospitalization, and 17 deaths occurred before age 5 years. A total of 1654 children survived to 5 years, and 1021 individuals were followed up (Figure 1); 996 children (478 females [48.0%]; 318 children born at less than 26 weeks [31.8%]; 154 children SGA < third percentile [15.5%]) had at least 1 of the follow-up instruments available (IQ score, ASQ-3 score from the parental questionnaire, or the MABC-2 assessment) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Of these individuals, 918 children had data on the Apgar score at 5 minutes of life (Figure 1). Data on IQ were available for 892 infants, on MABC-2 for 818 infants, and on ASQ-3 for 764 infants (Figure 1). Most infants had an Apgar score of 9 to 10 (306 individuals [33.3%]) or 7 to 8 (383 individuals [41.7%]), whereas 180 infants (19.6%) had scores of 4 to 6 and 49 infants (5.3%) had scores of 0 to 3 (Table 1). The follow-up rate varied by region, from 138 of 359 infants (38.4%) at the UK to 38 of 40 infants (95.0%) at Estonia, yielding an overall follow-up rate of 1021 of 1654 eligible infants (61.7%) at age 5 years.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^1157vuYJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Data management and statistical analyses

Participating doctors were instructed regarding definitions and study forms prior to the start of the study at the individual center. Data collected at participating sites were transmitted to the principal investigator and analyzed for the primary outcome criterion consisting of death or either one of the major morbidities (BPD, IVH, CPL, ROP). To test the hypothesis, the predictive values of the scores were compared by calculating the areas under the curve (AUC) and their co-variances of the receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC), based on an algorithm given by DeLong and co-workers. The comparisons of AUCs base on WALD tests. The significance of differences between estimated risks was tested by Chi-square tests; p-values are unadjusted for multiple testing. For sample size calculation a difference in AUC means of 0.01 and a SD in matched pairs of 0.1 were assumed. To detect a significant difference at a level of p = 0.01 with a power of 0.9 data of 1490 infants were required. Assuming a dropout rate of 30%, it was planned to recruit 2000 patients. For secondary data analysis, the AUC was calculated for each individual component of poor outcome. Data on mortality were analyzed for "death at any point" and "perinatal mortality". Furthermore, for each outcome criteria the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%-CI) were calculated. To do so, scores were categorized as follows: Specified-Apgar: poor (0–3 points), fair (4–6 points) or good (7–10 points), Expanded-Apgar: low (0–2 points), moderate (3–4 points), high (5–6 points) or no intervention (7 points); Combined-Apgar: very low (0–5 points), low (6–9 points), moderate (10–13 points) or high (14–17 points). The respectively highest category of each score was used as reference value. All analyses were performed by using SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, version 9.2).

Ethics committee approval

Approval was given by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany (EK 104052008) and in all participating centers. Written informed consent was obtained from the infant's parents before taking part in the study. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (NCT 00623038).

### The determinants of 5th minute low APGAR score among newborns who delivered at public hospitals in hawassa city, south Ethiopia [^113KcNqj]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Newborn morbidity and mortality are forecasted using the Apgar scores. Obstetricians worldwide have used the Apgar score for more than half a century for the assessment of immediate newborn conditions. It is a simple and convenient evaluation system that offers a standardized and effective assessment of newborn infants. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced if high-risk neonates are identified and managed adequately. This study aimed to assess the determinants of 5th minute low Apgar score among newborns at Public hospitals in Hawassa city, South Ethiopia.

Methods

A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted at Public Hospitals in Hawassa city. Data were collected from 134 cases and 267 controls using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire by observing, interviewing, and reviewing patient cards. Newborns who delivered with a 5th minute Apgar score < 7 were considered as cases; whereas a similar group of newborns with a 5th minute Apgar score of ≥ 7 were categorized as controls. A consecutive sampling technique was employed to recruit cases, while a simple random sampling technique was used to select controls. Data entry and analysis were performed using Epi Data version 3.1 and SPSS version 20 respectively. Binary and multivariable analyses with a 95% confidence level were performed. In the final model, variables with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

After controlling for possible confounding factors, the results showed that lack of physical and emotional support during labor and delivery [AOR = 3.5, 95%CI:1.82–6.76], rural residence [AOR = 4, 95%CI: 2.21–7.34], lack of antenatal care follow up [AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.91–6.33], anemia during pregnancy [AOR = 2.3,95%CI: 1.10–4.71] and low birth weight [AOR = 6.2, 95%CI: 2.78–14.03] were determinant factors of low Apgar scores. The area under the Apgar score ROC curve was 87.4%.

Conclusions

Lack of physical and emotional support, rural residence, lack of ANC follow-up, low birth weight, and anemia during pregnancy were determinant factors of a low Apgar score. 'Effective health education during preconception about anemia during pregnancy and ANC will help in detecting high-risk pregnancies that lead to a low Apgar score. In addition to the standard care of using electronic fetal monitoring, increasing access to compassion ships during labor and delivery is recommended.

### Mary crosse project: systematic reviews and grading the value of neonatal tests in predicting long term outcomes [^111vsU2n]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

The APGAR score, too, has been widely used for many years to quantify the neonatal condition at birth, considering heart rate, respiratory effort, colour and tone at 1, 5 and 9 minutes of age. Although it provides a useful summary of an infant's condition, studies correlating it to long term outcomes have varied widely in their findings. The significance of a low APGAR score where the clinical condition improves quickly is therefore uncertain, and will be investigated within the scope of this project. Similarly, measures at birth for fetal growth restriction have been associated with neonatal mortality, childhood disability and impaired neurodevelopment, educational disadvantage and disease in adult life (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension). However, a variety of different reference criteria for confirmation of growth restriction are used, including absolute birth weight < 2500 g, birth weight < 10 th centile adjusted for gestational age and local population values, and neonatal ponderal index < 10 th centile. There is lack of consensus as to which of these reference standards and thresholds has the strongest correlation with adverse outcome. This review will consider each parameter in turn and assess the association of neonatal, childhood and adult outcomes with each.

The need for admission to neonatal intensive care (NICU) is widely used as a reference standard for overall neonatal morbidity. However, the policy for admitting neonates varies widely between intensive care units both nationally and internationally, for example some would admit all babies born to diabetic mothers for a period of observation. This variation may affect the association of NICU admission with long term outcomes. More specific assessment of initial neonatal morbidity involves scoring systems used in the intensive care setting such as the Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) and the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP). We will assess the correlation between these scores and short and long term outcomes.

Clarification of the correlation between neonatal tests and subsequent outcomes is necessary to optimise clinical decision making and counselling of parents when an infant is affected. In turn, a better understanding of the long term associations of neonatal tests will improve understanding of the implications of tests and interventions in pregnancy that affect neonatal outcomes.

### Neonatal assessment in the delivery room – trial to evaluate a specified type of APGAR (TEST-Apgar) [^1171ht3t]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The description of the postnatal condition is incomplete without considering administered interventions. The Expanded-Apgar adds seven items as a measure for medical interventions needed to achieve the infant's condition. This extension seems long needed, because care of the newborn has changed significantly and an infant's condition often depends on medical interventions used to support postnatal transition. In the present study, the majority of infants showed a good clinical condition at 10 minutes of life, however, the number of interventions needed to achieve that condition increased with decreasing gestational age.

The seven items of the Expanded-Apgar represent medical interventions that are clearly defined. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical study to show a direct relationship between the number of interventions administered postnatally and subsequent survival. The more interventions were given the more likely the infant died within the first postnatal week. All infants with a Combined-Apgar below 6 for at least 10 minutes had a bad outcome. However, at this moment it remains unclear whether all interventions were clinically indicated or rather done as a result of current practice in individual institutions. More detailed analyses will have to analyze if there are differences in the predictive power of individual items of the Combined-Apgar.

Clinical implications

In the past, the 1-minute Apgar score was used to guide further treatment and the 5-minute score was a useful index of the effect(iveness) of resuscitation efforts. However, it remained unclear how infants were scored during resuscitation. It was suggested to interrupt resuscitation for evaluation purposes but this approach seems not practical. The Specified-Apgar describes the condition without interrupting intervention and the Expanded-Apgar adds the required information concerning the interventions. Thus, the Combined-Apgar evaluates both, infant's condition and resuscitative efforts and can be used to guide postnatal interventions.

A Combined-Apgar of 7–10 represents an infant without any clinical interventions (Expanded-Apgar of 7) and good clinical signs (Specified-Apgar of 10). In contrast a Combined-Apgar of 0–10 represents an infant with full resuscitative interventions (Expanded-Apgar 0) and a good clinical response (Specified- Apgar of 10). Finally, a Combined-Apgar of 0–0 represents an infant with full resuscitative interventions but no clinical response.

### APGAR score of 0 at 10 min and survival to 1 year of age: a retrospective cohort study in Washington state [^114oPtdV]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine 1-year survival in a cohort of newborns with an Apgar score of 0 at 5 and 10min of age.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study of the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System from 2005 to 2014.

Results

Of 879,340 births, 199 (0.02%) had an Apgar score of 0 at 5min, and 109 (0.01%) also had a score of 0 at 10min. One-year survival was 46% for newborns with Apgar score of 0 at 5 and 10min. One-year survival by gestational age was 4% for newborns < 30 weeks, 38% for 30–35 weeks, and 67% for ≥ 36 weeks.

Conclusion

Survival at 1 year of age for newborns with an Apgar score of 0 at 5 and 10min has improved, as compared with historic cohorts. Cautious optimism is warranted since morbidity-free survival could not be assessed.

### Combining activity and grimace scores reflects perinatal stability in infants [^1149XNMf]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Apgar score is the most widely used method for recording initial newborn status. It may be used to assess perinatal stability and identify infants that require closer observation in the hours after delivery. The Apgar score consists of five components: appearance (colour), pulse (heart rate), grimace (reflex irritability), activity (tone) and respiration (respiratory effort). There is currently limited understanding of the interobserver agreement (precision) of scores for initial activity and grimace and whether these scores independently predict resuscitation requirements at birth (accuracy).

Over 95% percent of very preterm infants (VPTI) receive respiratory support at birth, with 12–25% requiring emergency endotracheal intubation in the delivery room. Initial respiratory support influences survival and morbidity. These outcomes can be improved by avoiding unnecessary mechanical ventilation in stable infants whilst escalating care in those struggling with the transition to independent breathing. Early identification of infants who can achieve cardiopulmonary stability with spontaneous breathing on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may have utility in minimising unnecessary escalations in resuscitation and potential complications.

Video recording offers a high-fidelity tool to assign the components of the Apgar scores. Review of video recordings of neonatal resuscitation has led to improvements in clinical care. – Considering the degree of variability and potential bias in Apgar scoring, the validity of scores allocated at the time of birth is uncertain. Video recording provides the opportunity for multiple observers to focus on assessment without the need to simultaneously provide clinical intervention.

We hypothesised that initial activity and grimace of VPTI assessed using video recordings reliably predicts the level of respiratory support required to achieve cardiopulmonary stability during neonatal transition. We also aimed to compare differences in heart rate, oxygen saturations (SpO₂), airway pressures and oxygen requirements between groups.

### Factors associated with 5-min APGAR score, death and survival in neonatal intensive care: a case-control study [^116XRroV]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A low Apgar score is an important factor correlated with increased mortality in term and preterm infants without congenital anomalies. It is clinically used to assess hemodynamic impairment such as apnea, bradycardia, cyanosis, hypoperfusion, hypotonia, or respiratory depression. Is used clinically in the first minute as a screening tool to assess the need for early intervention, and in the fifth minute to assess how the newborn reacted to previous care. Still, in the fifth minute, the Apgar score is also relevant for the prediction of neonatal survival. Thus, a cutoff value of 7 points for low and high scores has been discussed by different studies and neurologists.

Identifying factors associated with the 5-minute Apgar score and death could be helpful in building strategies to reduce the number of neonatal deaths and morbidity associated with a low Apgar score. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the determinants of the 5-minute Apgar score and determine the factors associated with death and survival in newborns with low Apgar scores who were hospitalized in the NICU at a referral public hospital in Northern Brazil.

### Determinants of low fifth minute APGAR score among newborns delivered by cesarean section at wolaita sodo university comprehensive specialized hospital, Southern Ethiopia: an unmatched case control study [^112hAahi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Apgar score was proposed in 1952 as a means of rapidly evaluating the clinical status of newborn infants and currently remains an accepted method for newborn infant assessment immediately after delivery. Apgar score was estimated using five variables: strength and regularity of heart rate, lung maturity or breathing effort, muscle tone and movement, skin color or oxygenation and reflex response to irritable stimuli. The Apgar score ranges from 0 to 10. A total score of 7‒10 is considered as "normal" while a total score of below 7 is considered as "low Apgar score". a lower Apgar score indicates depressed vitality.

Apgar score is usually done to the baby twice: once at first minute after birth, and again at fifth minute after birth. The first minute Apgar score may signal the need for immediate resuscitation, and the 5 min score may signal the probability of successfully resuscitation following the record the first minute Apgar score. This means that if there is successfully resuscitation at the first minute, the Apgar score at fifth minute will be satisfactory. On the other hand, a low Apgar score at 1 min may not necessarily mean a low Apgar score at 5 min. The 5 min Apgar score may also provide an indication of a neonate's sustained capacity to survive and thrive. It is for this reason that the second Apgar score assessment, made at 5 min, is a better predictor of later outcomes than the Apgar score at first minute.

### Committee opinion no. 644: the APGAR score [^114Eexde]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The Apgar score provides an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth and the response to resuscitation if needed. The Apgar score alone cannot be considered to be evidence of or a consequence of asphyxia, does not predict individual neonatal mortality or neurologic outcome, and should not be used for that purpose. An Apgar score assigned during a resuscitation is not equivalent to a score assigned to a spontaneously breathing infant. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourage use of an expanded Apgar score reporting form that accounts for concurrent resuscitative interventions.

### Application of machine learning in identifying risk factors for low APGAR scores [^114uQR3A]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration (APGAR) scores are influenced by a variety of maternal, delivery-related, and biological factors that can compromise neonatal health. The APGAR score, introduced by Dr. Virginia Apgar in 1952, is a rapid assessment tool used to evaluate newborn health immediately after birth based on five criteria: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace response, Activity, and Respiration. A score below 7 at five minutes post-delivery is a critical indicator of potential health complications and is associated with increased risks of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Understanding the factors contributing to low APGAR scores is essential for healthcare providers, as these scores impact both immediate neonatal care and long-term health outcomes.

Maternal health conditions, such as inadequate prenatal care, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and substance use, significantly affect newborn APGAR scores. Insufficient prenatal support is linked to higher rates of low APGAR scores, often necessitating extended hospital stays and additional medical interventions. Conditions like maternal substance abuse further exacerbate neonatal risks, leading to complications such as neonatal abstinence syndrome. Delivery-related factors, including the administration of labor medications and complications during childbirth, also play a critical role. Medications given to mothers during labor can affect neonatal physiology, while complications such as prolonged labor or emergency cesarean sections may jeopardize the infant's health.

Biological factors, such as prematurity and congenital anomalies, are well-established contributors to low APGAR scores. Premature infants often face physiological challenges, including underdeveloped organ systems, which can result in immediate instability. Congenital malformations also compromise neonatal health, further lowering APGAR scores.

The implications of low APGAR scores extend beyond the neonatal period. Studies have shown that low scores are predictive of long-term developmental and neurological challenges, such as cerebral palsy and cognitive impairments. Infants with low scores face an elevated risk of lifelong disabilities and educational difficulties, emphasizing the importance of identifying and addressing contributing factors during prenatal and postnatal care. Comprehensive prenatal care and targeted interventions, including early identification of high-risk pregnancies, are essential to improving neonatal outcomes and reducing the risks associated with low APGAR scores.

### Low APGAR scores and the definition of birth asphyxia [^114orRum]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, prolonged labor, meconium-stained fluid, a low 1-minute Apgar score, and mild to moderate acidemia have no predictive value for long-term neurologic injury without signs of encephalopathy and seizures. It is important to provide proper resuscitation, support infants, and allow time for evaluation. We have time and the tools to provide fairly predictive information to the families. It is important to use this knowledge wisely in communicating honestly with families, because difficult decisions undoubtedly will arise.

### The APGAR cycle: a new view of a familiar scoring system [^112T7Zvm]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Apgar scores are universally recorded, but they should no longer be used to guide resuscitation; thus, some authorities have suggested that the scores should be abandoned. However, the physiological relationships underlying the elements of the Apgar scoring system can be conceptualised as a cycle, wherein the five functions are linked by cardiorespiratory reflexes and metabolically supported by the oxygen pathway. Respiratory effort represents both the main input into the system and its functional output (sustained respirations). The progressive deterioration of functions during asphyxia, and their recovery during resuscitation, are readily understood within the sequence. This depiction helps in learning concepts such as primary and secondary apnoea and bradycardia. The visual model harmonises the pedagogical and practical values of the Apgar scoring system, by placing the rapid assessment of respirations, heart rate and colour during neonatal resuscitation (as taught in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program) in its broader physiological context. The understanding imparted by the Apgar cycle may directly enhance patient care during resuscitation, apart from the attribution of numerical scores.

### Prevalence and factors associated with low 5th minute APGAR score among mothers who birth through emergency cesarean section: prospective cross-sectional study in Ethiopia [^111cwYy4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Back ground

The APGAR score is the method to assess the status of the neonate in the first minutes of life. It has been used in maternity to assess the newborn infant's overall status and response to resuscitation for more than half a century since its first introduction to delivery practice. The score uses 5 important parameters to evaluate the status, which are breathing, muscle tone, skin color, heart rate, and reflex irritability, each scored on a scale from 0 to 2. It is a well-known, easy, and accepted method of assessing the neonate so far. The final score of the assessment is out of 10, so if the score is less than 7, it is considered a low APGAR score. Commonly, the 1st and 5th minutes APGAR scores are used to assess the status of the neonate; however, the measurement can be extended to the 10th, 15th, and 20th minutes if a low APGAR score is recorded and further resuscitation is needed. It should not be used to determine the need for initial resuscitation, what steps are next, and when to do them. According to the Neonatal Encephalopathy and Neurologic Outcome report, a 5-minute APGAR score of 7 to 10 is reassuring, a score of 4 to 6 is moderately abnormal, and a score of 0 to 3 is low in the term infant and late-preterm infant.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend the use of the APGAR score along with resuscitative interventions, known as the expanded APGAR score. However, the application of the APGAR score in contemporary obstetric practice has been questioned by many organizations and studies. Concerns include its poor predictability, interobserver variations, and geographic discrepancies in reporting. Additionally, the APGAR score's applicability to premature infants is problematic, and there is uncertainty about how to score infants during resuscitation. Due to these and other concerns, some scholars advocate for its removal from clinical practice. Nevertheless, until better recommendations and methods that address these limitations are developed, the APGAR score will continue to be used. Despite its limitations, the APGAR score remains widely used in clinical practice. Its simplicity and historical significance make it a valuable tool, especially in settings where advanced resources may not be readily available. However, it is crucial to continue exploring and developing new methods that address the APGAR score's limitations, ensuring that neonatal assessment practices evolve to provide the best care possible.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^116Szbs5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The main strengths of our study are the longer-term follow-up evaluation that may provide better evidence for cognitive and motor outcomes, prospective approach based on predefined parameters and outcome definitions, and execution within 19 geographically and organizationally diverse regions across 11 European countries that may allow the broad application of results to a wide range of clinical care settings. The selected statistical approach with risk adjustment for severe neonatal morbidities associated with the neurodevelopmental outcome may provide an indication that the Apgar score did not give additional information on outcomes beyond its association with neonatal morbidities. Furthermore, we used IPW and multiple imputation to adjust for loss to follow-up and missing data, including missing Apgar scores.

Thorough risk adjustments for variations in sociodemographic factors, baseline demographic parameters, perinatal characteristics, and severe neonatal morbidities made it possible to account for known factors associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and thus an association of Apgar score with the outcome is unlikely. We constructed models sequentially, starting with socioeconomic factors that may be associated with risk at birth and neurodevelopment at age 5 years but that would not be associated with Apgar score, perinatal risks present at birth, and a final model including neonatal morbidities, introduced separately given that these may act as mediators rather than confounders. This final model needs to be interpreted taking into consideration that neonatal morbidities are themselves associated with the Apgar score. This sequential approach allowed us to illustrate congruent results adjusting for perinatal as well as neonatal factors.

This study also has several limitations. Although we integrated many known risk factors, the number of documented items in the study was limited and we could not integrate information on race or ethnicity beyond foreign maternal birth or on the family context aside from maternal living situation and education and parental employment status. The low percentage of infants with Apgar scores of 0 to 3 and the restricted sample size compared with studies on preterm mortality constitute further restrictions of our analyses, but larger-scale clinical follow-up would not have been feasible. Additionally, there may have been varying attitudes of neonatal intensive care unit teams toward active care at less than 24 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we could not ascertain how sociodemographic status may have been associated with family support measures and the reluctance of parents to participate due to severe limitations of their infants and variations in follow-up service use at age 5 years in different regions. Further selection bias may have been introduced by the varying follow-up rates by country. Additionally, umbilical cord blood gas parameters were not available from all participating centers, prohibiting their inclusion in analyses.

### APGAR score and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 5 years in infants born extremely preterm [^116dHGkN]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Several hypotheses can be put forward for the unsuitability of the Apgar score as a prognostic marker associated with the longer-term outcome in infants born EPT in contrast to infants born at term. First, it was developed for infants born at term and those born EPT have generally reduced viability signs and poorer responses toward resuscitation after birth that are reflected by lower Apgar score values with decreasing gestational age. These facts cannot be naturally equated with postnatal fetal depression or interpreted to indicate insufficient resuscitation measures. Second, the Apgar score's estimation accuracy for the outcome of infants born preterm may be hampered by intraobserver and interobserver variability, as well as differences in attitudes toward active resuscitation and in therapeutic measures in the delivery room between different centers and regions. Third, the risk of mortality is associated to a greater extent with the clinical condition after birth given that 50% of deaths among infants born EPT occur within the first 10 days of life. There were 851 deaths during the neonatal hospitalization and 17 deaths after discharge, and mortality selection may therefore contribute to a lack of association between the Apgar score and longer-term outcomes in this population and may have impacted our results. Furthermore, morbidities appearing later during the longitudinal course of neonatal intensive care unit therapy are affected by multiple and repeated exposures and therapies, including complications like late onset sepsis or frequent hypoxemic episodes. During this time, the largest increase in brain volume and expansion of the gray matter occurs, and vulnerability seems to differ across developmental stages that could moderate or override risk factors at birth. In any case, the discordance in the association of Apgar score with outcomes between children by gestational age at birth deserves further mechanistic explanation in future studies. Lastly, socioeconomic factors during the first 5 years of life are associated with a large change in neurodevelopmental outcomes, as detailed previously in our cohort, and may overshadow outcomes associated with perinatal risk factors.

### Associations between provider-assigned APGAR score and neonatal race [^1119UcwG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

For decades, the Apgar scoring system has been used to evaluate neonatal status and determine need for resuscitation or escalation in care, such as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. However, the variation and accuracy of provider-assigned Apgar scores across neonatal racial groups have yet to be evaluated.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate how provider-assigned Apgar scores vary by neonatal race independently of clinical factors and umbilical cord gas values.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at an urban academic medical center. All live births at ≥ 23 weeks and 0 days of gestation from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 with complete data available were included. Data were queried from the electronic medical record and included race, ethnicity, gestational age of neonate, umbilical cord gas values (umbilical artery pH and base deficit), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and presence of maternal-fetal complications. Primary outcome measures were neonates' Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Color Apgar score and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit served as secondary outcome measures. We performed 3 partially proportional ordinal regression models controlling for an increasing number of covariates, with Model 1, the baseline model, adjusted for gestational age, Model 2 additionally adjusted for umbilical cord gases, and Model 3 additionally adjusted for maternal medical conditions and pregnancy complications.

Results

A total of 977 neonates met selection criteria; 553 (56.6%) were Black. Providers assigned Black neonates significantly lower Apgar scores at 1 minute (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.80) and 5 minutes (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.87), when controlling for umbilical artery gases, gestational age, and maternal-fetal complications. This difference seemed related to significantly lower assigned color Apgar scores at 1 minute when controlling for all the above factors (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.39–0.68). Providers admitted full-term Black neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit at higher rates than non-Black neonates when controlling for all factors (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.77). Black neonates did not have more abnormal cord gas values (mean umbilical artery pH of 7.259 for Black vs 7.256 for non-Black neonates), which would have supported their admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Conclusion

Providers applied inaccurate Apgar scores to Black neonates given that the umbilical cord gases were not in agreement with lower Apgar scores. These inaccuracies may be a factor in unnecessary admissions to neonatal intensive care units, and suggest that colorism and racial biases exist among healthcare providers.
