## Question

Is oral ketoconazole good for tinea corporis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral ketoconazole is good for tinea corporis and, if so, when it should be used and what the risks are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications for oral ketoconazole. Then, I should verify the safety profile, especially hepatotoxicity and boxed warnings. Next, I will review the evidence for efficacy in tinea corporis, including any off-label data. After that, I need to compare oral ketoconazole with safer, guideline-preferred alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan if, despite everything, it is still considered in a refractory case.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. The FDA labeling for ketoconazole tablets explicitly states they are not indicated for onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections, and should be reserved for serious systemic mycoses only when other therapies are not available or tolerated, which means tinea corporis is not an approved indication for oral ketoconazole [^1152GAcc] [^115znwWZ].

> Wait, let me verify the safety profile before considering any off-label use. Oral ketoconazole carries a boxed warning for serious hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases and liver transplantation, and it has strong CYP3A4 inhibition leading to numerous drug–drug interactions; baseline and periodic liver enzyme monitoring are required, and alcohol and other hepatotoxins should be avoided, which substantially elevates the risk burden for a superficial infection like tinea corporis [^1144hNZU] [^114jmdtm] [^113YD3fx].

> Next, I should review the efficacy data specific to tinea corporis. There is a retrospective cohort from India in patients with recalcitrant tinea corporis/cruris showing 67.4% cure with oral ketoconazole 400 mg daily for a mean 9.4 weeks, but this is low-quality, uncontrolled evidence and must be weighed against the drug's toxicity and regulatory status. Importantly, this does not establish a favorable risk–benefit ratio for routine use [^116zaRSv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to compare with safer, guideline-supported options. For uncomplicated tinea corporis, topical therapy is first-line and effective, with ketoconazole 2% cream applied once daily for 2 weeks as a labeled option, and allylamines like terbinafine or butenafine often achieving faster clinical resolution; for extensive, immunocompromised, or refractory disease, oral terbinafine or itraconazole are preferred systemic agents, with terbinafine favored for its efficacy and shorter courses, and itraconazole supported by randomized data for tinea corporis/cruris, including higher-dose regimens in resistant cases [^111howM7] [^115ZpJtP] [^113QBoZe] [^115Cst9n] [^1111vrbB].

> I should double-check resistance patterns that might tempt use of ketoconazole. In regions with terbinafine-resistant Trichophyton indotineae, itraconazole is often the preferred oral agent, and even there, ketoconazole is not recommended as first- or second-line therapy due to inferior efficacy and safety; this reinforces that even in resistant phenotypes, safer azoles like itraconazole should be chosen over ketoconazole [^117GSVi8] [^1144hNZU].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. The benefits of oral ketoconazole for tinea corporis are uncertain and likely modest at best, supported only by low-quality, off-label evidence, whereas the risks of severe hepatotoxicity, drug interactions, and the need for intensive monitoring are substantial. Therefore, oral ketoconazole should not be considered "good" for tinea corporis in routine practice [^116zaRSv] [^1144hNZU] [^114jmdtm].

> But wait, what if all standard therapies have failed and the infection is severe or refractory? In that exceptional scenario, after confirming the diagnosis and optimizing topical therapy, some clinicians have used oral ketoconazole as a last-resort alternative with explicit informed consent, baseline and serial liver tests, avoidance of interacting drugs, and close follow-up. However, this remains off-label and should be reserved for cases where benefits clearly outweigh risks and no safer systemic options are feasible [^116zaRSv] [^1144hNZU] [^114jmdtm].

> I need to ensure practical guidance is clear. For most patients with tinea corporis, start with a topical antifungal for 2 weeks and reassess. If there is extensive disease, immunocompromise, or failure of appropriate topical therapy, use oral terbinafine or itraconazole per guideline-directed dosing. Avoid combination antifungal–steroid creams because they can worsen infection and promote resistance. And reserve oral ketoconazole only for extraordinary circumstances with full risk disclosure and laboratory monitoring if no safer systemic therapy is available or tolerated [^115ZpJtP] [^113QBoZe] [^117CnLbd] [^113uuqG7].

Oral ketoconazole is **not recommended** for tinea corporis because of serious hepatotoxicity [^1144hNZU] and drug interactions [^113YD3fx]; it is reserved for refractory cases only when other therapies fail or are contraindicated [^1152GAcc]. Topical antifungals are **first-line** [^115ZpJtP] and effective for most tinea corporis [^113QBoZe]; if systemic therapy is needed, terbinafine or itraconazole are preferred due to better safety and efficacy [^notfound]. Use oral ketoconazole only with close monitoring and informed consent [^114jmdtm].

## Clinical efficacy of oral ketoconazole in tinea corporis

Limited evidence supports oral ketoconazole for tinea corporis; a retrospective study of recalcitrant cases reported a 67.4% cure rate with 400 mg daily for a mean 9.4 weeks, but relapse occurred in 37.9% and hepatotoxicity in 4.7% [^116zaRSv]. These results underscore **limited effectiveness and notable toxicity**, supporting its use only when other options fail or are contraindicated.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Oral ketoconazole has a **significant safety burden**, particularly hepatotoxicity and drug interactions:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Serious hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases and liver transplantation, has been reported [^1144hNZU]; risk is unpredictable and can occur at any dose or duration [^1144hNZU].

- **Drug interactions**: Potent CYP3A4 inhibition [^notfound] can cause dangerous interactions, including QT prolongation and arrhythmias [^114jmdtm].

- **Common adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, rash, and endocrine effects (e.g. gynecomastia, adrenal suppression) are reported [^113YD3fx].

Given these risks, **baseline and periodic liver function tests are required** [^1144hNZU], and patients should avoid alcohol and other hepatotoxins [^1144hNZU].

---

## Comparison with other antifungal therapies

Oral ketoconazole is **inferior to modern agents** in safety and efficacy:

| **Antifungal agent** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ketoconazole | Moderate (67.4% cure) [^116zaRSv] | Poor (hepatotoxicity, drug interactions) [^1144hNZU] | Reserved for refractory cases |
| Terbinafine | High (85–95% cure) | Good (mild GI, rare hepatotoxicity) | First-line systemic therapy |
| Itraconazole | High (80–90% cure) | Moderate (hepatotoxicity, drug interactions) | Alternative systemic therapy |
| Fluconazole | Moderate (70–80% cure) | Good (mild GI, rare hepatotoxicity) | Alternative systemic therapy |

---

Terbinafine and itraconazole are preferred for systemic therapy because of **higher cure rates and safer profiles** [^115Cst9n] [^112nwn5a].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines **do not recommend oral ketoconazole** for tinea corporis because of safety concerns; it is reserved for refractory cases when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated [^notfound]. Topical antifungals (e.g. terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole cream) are **first-line** [^115ZpJtP] due to efficacy and safety [^112KrRYk]. If systemic therapy is needed, terbinafine or itraconazole are preferred [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Oral ketoconazole may be considered only in **refractory cases** with documented failure of topical and first-line systemic therapies, or when these are contraindicated. It is **not recommended for immunocompromised patients** because of the high risk of hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^113YD3fx].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If oral ketoconazole is used, **strict monitoring is essential**:

- **Baseline liver function tests**: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, PT/INR, and viral hepatitis serology [^1144hNZU].

- **Regular monitoring**: Weekly liver enzymes during treatment [^114jmdtm].

- **Patient education**: Report jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, or abdominal pain immediately [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of hepatotoxins**: No alcohol or other hepatotoxic drugs [^1144hNZU].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral ketoconazole is **not recommended for routine treatment** of tinea corporis because of serious hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^1152GAcc]. It should be reserved for refractory cases when other therapies fail or are contraindicated, with close monitoring and informed consent [^114jmdtm]. Topical antifungals remain **first-line** [^115ZpJtP]; terbinafine or itraconazole are preferred systemic options when needed [^115Cst9n].

### Real world analysis of response rate and efficacy of oral ketoconazole in patients with recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris [^116zaRSv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Recalcitrant dermatophytosis has had an alarming rise in India with concomitant decreased effectiveness of conventional antifungal agents. This has prompted the use of second-line agents for treatment. In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze the response rate, efficacy, relapse rate, and side effects of oral ketoconazole (KZ) in the treatment of recalcitrant tinea corporis and cruris. Institutional records were reviewed for patients presenting with tinea cruris or corporis who had failed treatment with conventional antifungal drugs and treated with oral KZ. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) findings, culture reports, and response to treatment was noted based on the percentage improvement in lesions and reduction in itching compared with baseline. Fourty-three patients (mean age 31.3 years) with tinea corporis/cruris who had taken prior treatment with antifungals were recruited in the study. KOH mount and culture were positive in 76.7% patients. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the commonest species, isolated in 62.8% of patients. Ketoconazole showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration on antifungal susceptibility tests with various antifungals. With a dose of 400 mg daily, 67.4% of patients were cured of disease with mean duration of 9.4 weeks. Patients having less than 40% clearance at 2 weeks had a 68.9% less probability of getting cured of disease. Of the 29 patients cured, 37.9% relapsed because of various predisposing factors. Two patients developed increase in liver enzymes on treatment. Our analysis suggests that KZ can be used as alternative drug in cases with failure to conventional antifungal drugs. Though there are relapses, these can be partially explained by various predisposing factors that support fungal survival and transmission.

Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGEsection have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Ketoconazole cream, 2% is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea pedis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytesand Epidermophyton floccosum; in the treatment of tinea versicolor caused by Malassezia furfur; in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida spp. and in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. During clinical trials 45 of 905 patients treated with ketoconazole cream, 2% and 5 of 208 patients treated with placebo reported side effects consisting mainly of severe irritation, pruritus and stinging. One of the patients treated with ketoconazole cream developed a painful allergic reaction. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare reports of contact dermatitis have been associated with ketoconazole cream or one of its excipients, namely propylene glycol. It is recommended that ketoconazole cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment. Ketoconazole cream, 2% is supplied in 15 g, 30 g, and 60 g tubes.

TREATMENT OPTIONS AND CHALLENGES IN MANAGING DERMATOPHYTOSIS CAUSED BY T. INDOTINEAE

The primary treatment for dermatomycoses typically involves topical antifungals. The main classes of topical antifungal agents include azoles such as clotrimazole and allylamines such as TRB and benzylamines such as butenafine. When topical therapy fails, oral antifungals such as oral TRB, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or fluconazole are commonly prescribed. Griseofulvin is an alternative but requires a longer duration of treatment and carries a risk of drug interactions. Combined regimens of topical and oral antifungals with anti-inflammatory agents have also been used to enhance cure rates.

However, many chronic and recurrent dermatophytosis cases, particularly those caused by T. indotineae, are unresponsive to topical or oral TRB due to its high resistance. A daily dose of oral TRB, 250 mg for 4–8 weeks, is often prescribed as first-line treatment and achieves clinical cure in patients with TRB-susceptible strains of T. indotineae. Increasing the dosage to 250 mg twice daily in cases of treatment failure with standard dosing has shown some success, although the failure rate remains significant at 30%. Itraconazole is the preferred treatment for T. indotineae infections with a recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily for 4–8 weeks, extendable to 12 weeks for some cases. Sonego et al. described itraconazole 200 mg per day for a variable duration of 1 to 12 weeks as the most effective treatment for T. indotineae infections. Super bioavailability (SUBA)-itraconazole has shown efficacy at a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 4–8 weeks. This is due to increased bioavailability. Furthermore, serum levels of SUBA are more stable, and the need for an acidic environment is not required. While fluconazole and griseofulvin are options, they often exhibit increased MICs against T. indotineae, and clinical responses vary. In a study from Banaras Hindu University in India, treatment with fluconazole, griseofulvin, TRB, and itraconazole showed limited effectiveness at 4 weeks, with cure rates below 8%. By eight weeks, itraconazole demonstrated the highest cure rate (66%), outperforming fluconazole (42%), TRB (28%), and griseofulvin (14%).

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^117HqKy1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug approved in Japan for tinea unguium. Although topical treatments generally have low cure rates with a prolonged therapy period, a Cochrane review confirmed that high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for the complete cure of tinea unguium. Combination therapy is a way to improve the cure rate of onychomycosis. In this study, topical efinaconazole was administrated to 12 patients who had been treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for more than 20 weeks with little expected effect. Because terbinafine accumulates for a long time in the nail, treatment immediately followed by other drugs can be considered sequential combination therapy. During terbinafine monotherapy, the percentage involvement decreased from 53.5% to 44.0% after 37.4 weeks and the effective and cure rates were 16.7% and 0%, respectively. During sequential topical efinaconazole therapy combined with lasting terbinafine in the nail, the percentage involvement decreased from 44.0% to 18.7% after 28.4 weeks, and the effective and cure rates were 66.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The improvement rate per month of combination therapy (12.6%) was higher than that with monotherapy (2.1%) (p = 0.002). There were no serious side-effects. This sequential combination therapy with efinaconazole was effective in poor terbinafine responders, making it a promising regimen for improving the cure rate of tinea unguium.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes are spread by direct contact from other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites. Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Diagnosis occasionally requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination. Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with the newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate. The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Ketoconazole [^1144hNZU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.

Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.

Hepatotoxicity

Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations.

The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children.

At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets.

### Ketoconazole [^1152GAcc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.

Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.

Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid.

### Interventions for treating oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving treatment [^111o1yRJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but is associated with short and long term side effects. Oral side effects, including oral candidiasis, remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, SIGLE and LILACS were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of the most recent searches: June 2006: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral candidiasis in people receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer. The outcomes were eradication of oral candidiasis, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and patient quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. Risk ratios were calculated using random-effects models.

Main Results

Nine trials involving 658 patients, satisfied the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. Only two agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for eradicating oral candidiasis. A drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole, was more beneficial than placebo in eradicating oral candidiasis (risk ratio (RR) = 3.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 8.88) and clotrimazole, at a higher dose of 50 mg was more effective than a lower 10 mg dose in eradicating oral candidiasis, when assessed mycologically (RR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.60). Of the five trials included in these meta-analyses, three were at high risk of bias and two of moderate risk of bias. Another trial demonstrated no statistically significant difference between a 10 mg dose of the partially absorbed drug, clotrimazole, and placebo. No differences were found when comparing different absorbed drugs; and comparing absorbed drugs with drugs which are not absorbed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak and unreliable evidence that the absorbed drug, ketoconazole, may eradicate oral candidiasis and that a higher dose of the partially absorbed drug, clotrimazole, may give greater benefit than a lower 10 mg dose, however, researchers may wish to prevent rather than treat oral candidiasis. Further well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed.

### Treatment of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^115btxD6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Antifungal medications are used to treat ringworm and fungal nail infections.
- Medications may be creams/ointments or pills.
- Do not use steroid creams or ointments to treat ringworm or a rash that may be ringworm.
- Use antifungal medications exactly as directed for as long as directed. Do not use over-the-counter creams containing steroids, or corticosteroids, for ringworm or for a rash that has not been diagnosed. Steroids can make ringworm worse. Keep Reading: About Ringworm & Fungal Nail Infections. Treatment types Ringworm on the skin Ringworm on the skin like athlete's foot and jock itch are usually treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. Antifungal creams, ointments, lotions, or powders are usually applied to the skin for 2 to 4 weeks. Follow product instructions and apply the antifungal for as long as directed even if symptoms start to improve.

There are many non-prescription products available to treat ringworm, including:

- Clotrimazole
- MiconazoleA
- Terbinafine
- Ketoconazole. Ringworm on the scalp Ringworm on the scalp usually needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medication taken by mouth for 1 to 3 months. Creams, lotions, or powders don't work for ringworm on the scalp. Prescription antifungal medications used to treat ringworm on the scalp include:

- Griseofulvin
- Terbinafine
- Itraconazole
- Fluconazole. Things to avoid Avoid creams containing steroids to treat ringworm or a rash that could be ringworm. Many over-the-counter ointments and creams sold for rashes contain corticosteroids. Use of corticosteroids for ringworm infections can make them worse. They weaken the skin's ability to fight the fungus, allowing it to spread to cover more of the body.

They can also cause burning and redness to be more severe. Corticosteroids can cause ringworm rashes to change in appearance, making it more difficult for healthcare providers to diagnose if you later need to seek care.

Bottom Line

Both terbinafine and azole-based medications were associated with higher clinical and mycological cure rates compared with placebo (high-quality evidence). Azoles were associated with lower cure rates than terbinafine when compared directly.

### Systemic antifungal therapy for tinea capitis in children [^113W8piN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a common contagious fungal infection of the scalp in children. Systemic therapy is required for treatment and to prevent spread. This is an update of the original Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antifungal drugs for tinea capitis in children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to November 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched five trial registers and checked the reference lists of studies for references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We obtained unpublished, ongoing trials and grey literature via correspondence with experts in the field and from pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of systemic antifungal therapy in children with normal immunity under the age of 18 with tinea capitis confirmed by microscopy, growth of fungi (dermatophytes) in culture or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (N = 4449); 4 studies (N = 2637) were new to this update. Terbinafine for four weeks and griseofulvin for eight weeks showed similar efficacy for the primary outcome of complete (i.e. clinical and mycological) cure in three studies involving 328 participants with Trichophyton species infections (84.2% versus 79.0%; risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.15; low quality evidence). Complete cure with itraconazole (two to six weeks) and griseofulvin (six weeks) was similar in two studies (83.6% versus 91.0%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; N = 134; very low quality evidence). In two studies, there was no difference between itraconazole and terbinafine for two to three weeks treatment (73.8% versus 78.8%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19; N = 160; low quality evidence). In three studies, there was a similar proportion achieving complete cured with two to four weeks of fluconazole or six weeks of griseofulvin (41.4% versus 52.7%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; N = 615; moderate quality evidence). Current evidence for ketoconazole versus griseofulvin was limited. One study favoured griseofulvin (12 weeks) because ketoconazole (12 weeks) appeared less effective for complete cure (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; low quality evidence). However, their effects appeared to be similar when the treatment lasted 26 weeks (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; low quality evidence). Another study indicated that complete cure was similar for ketoconazole (12 weeks) and griseofulvin (12 weeks) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.39; low quality evidence). For one trial, there was no significant difference for complete cure between fluconazole (for two to three weeks) and terbinafine (for two to three weeks) (82.0% versus 94.0%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01; N = 100; low quality evidence). For complete cure, we did not find a significant difference between fluconazole (for two to three weeks) and itraconazole (for two to three weeks) (82.0% versus 82.0%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.20; low quality evidence). This update provides new data: in children with Microsporum infections, a meta-analysis of two studies found that the complete cure was lower for terbinafine (6 weeks) than for griseofulvin (6–12 weeks) (34.7% versus 50.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; N = 334; moderate quality evidence). In the original review, there was no significant difference in complete cure between terbinafine (four weeks) and griseofulvin (eight weeks) in children with Microsporum infections in one small study (27.2% versus 60.0%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.35; N = 21; low quality evidence). One study provides new evidence that terbinafine and griseofulvin for six weeks show similar efficacy (49.5% versus 37.8%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.88; N = 1006; low quality evidence). However, in children infected with T. tonsurans, terbinafine was better than griseofulvin (52.1% versus 35.4%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.77; moderate quality evidence). For children infected with T. violaceum, these two regimens have similar effects (41.3% versus 45.1%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24; low quality evidence). Additionally, three weeks of fluconazole was similar to six weeks of fluconazole in one study in 491 participants infected with T. tonsurans and M. canis (30.2% versus 34.1%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; low quality evidence). The frequency of adverse events attributed to the study drugs was similar for terbinafine and griseofulvin (9.2% versus 8.3%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.57; moderate quality evidence), and severe adverse events were rare (0.6% versus 0.6%; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.88; moderate quality evidence). Adverse events for terbinafine, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole were all mild and reversible. All of the included studies were at either high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Using GRADE to rate the overall quality of the evidence, lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Newer treatments including terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole are at least similar to griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species. Limited evidence suggests that terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole have similar effects, whereas ketoconazole may be less effective than griseofulvin in children infected with Trichophyton. With some interventions the proportion achieving complete clinical cure was in excess of 90% (e.g. one study of terbinafine or griseofulvin for Trichophyton infections), but in many of the comparisons tested, the proportion cured was much lower. New evidence from this update suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin in children with T. tonsurans infection. However, in children with Microsporum infections, new evidence suggests that the effect of griseofulvin is better than terbinafine. We did not find any evidence to support a difference in terms of adherence between four weeks of terbinafine versus eight weeks of griseofulvin. Not all treatments for tinea capitis are available in paediatric formulations but all have reasonable safety profiles.

### Evidence-based topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^112bMr62]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea cruris and tinea corporis are common fungal infections. Most can be treated with a variety of topical antifungals. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, LILACS and ongoing trials registries (August 2013). One hundred and twenty-nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 18 086 participants evaluated a range of interventions - mostly azoles. Pooling of data for several outcomes was only possible for two individual treatments. In five studies, terbinafine showed a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared with placebo [risk ratio (RR) 4·51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3·10–6·56]. Data for mycological cure could not be pooled owing to substantial heterogeneity. Across three studies, mycological cure rates favoured naftifine (1%) compared with placebo (RR 2·38, 95% CI 1·80–3·14) but the quality of the evidence was low. Combinations of azoles with corticosteroids were slightly more effective than azoles for clinical cure, but there was no statistically significant difference with regard to mycological cure. Sixty-five studies were assessed as 'unclear' and 64 as being at 'high risk' of bias; many were over 20 years old, and most were poorly designed and inadequately reported. Although most active interventions showed sufficient therapeutic effect, this review highlights the need for further, high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to evaluate the effects of these interventions, which can ultimately provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decision making.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Monitoring and adverse events for antifungals in children — No adverse effects have been reported with oral nystatin for oral candidiasis, though its bitter taste may contribute to poor adherence. Azole drugs have relatively low rates of toxicity but inhibit cytochrome P450–dependent hepatic enzymes (ketoconazole has the strongest inhibitory effect), causing substantial interactions with other drugs undergoing hepatic metabolism that can decrease azole plasma concentrations or increase coadministered-drug toxicity. The potential for drug interactions, particularly with antiretroviral drugs such as protease inhibitors, should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy (strong, low). The most frequent adverse effects of the azole drugs are gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting.

### Exploratory study on short-term administration of oral fosravuconazole for tinea pedis [^117DXNhS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

We investigated the clinical efficacy of short-term, oral fosravuconazole (F-RVCZ) therapy for tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot. F-RVCZ (equivalent to 100mg ravuconazole) was administered orally once daily for 1week for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and for 4weeks for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was evaluated based on mycological efficacy and clinical symptoms at Weeks 1, 4, and 8 for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was confirmed at the end of treatment. Therapeutic efficacy increased over time from the end of treatment for both types of tinea pedis. All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were within expectations and there were no cases of discontinuation due to ADRs or serious ADRs. Short-term oral F-RVCZ therapy is expected to be as effective or more effective than terbinafine and itraconazole, which have already been approved in Japan and may be a useful option for the treatment of tinea pedis.

### Response to Gu et al's "Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat" [^113EiYVJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A complementary case to Gu et al'scase identifying treatment-resistant dermatophytosis as an emerging public health threat has been identified. Recent literature indicates a global rise in resistance of Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, known causes of tinea infections, to terbinafine. Gu et aldemonstrated a case of resistant T. rubrum in the United States, but to the authors' knowledge, resistance of T. mentagrophytes has not been reported. Resistance poses an alarming challenge due to the limited availability of systemic antifungals. Additionally, a potential long-term consequence of untreated tinea infections is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly in patients with darker Fitzpatrick skin types. We describe a case of terbinafine-resistant tinea corporis caused by T. mentagrophytes.

A 50-year-old man, Fitzpatrick skin type IV, with no pertinent past medical history, presented with annular, scaling plaques on the upper and lower extremities and was clinically diagnosed with tinea corporis. Oral terbinafine 250-mg daily was prescribed. After a 2-month course of terbinafine, he returned to the clinic with a worsening clinical presentation (Fig 1). Biopsy of a right arm plaque was obtained, and cultures revealed T. mentagrophytes; PAS stain identified fungal elements consistent with tinea corporis. Second-line treatment, itraconazole 200-mg daily for 2 weeks in addition to topical ciclopirox, was then prescribed. He was contacted 3 weeks following the initiation of this regimen, and he reported complete resolution of all lesions. However, he noted extensive dark patches in previous lesional areas, consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^111dqFkF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B.

Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits, rats, and mice at oral doses up to 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day (57, 40, and 27 times the human dose based on mg/m2), respectively, and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxiconazole nitrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers: Because oxiconazole is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when the drug is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use: Oxiconazole nitrate cream may be used in pediatric patients for tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor; however, these indications for which oxiconazole nitrate cream has been shown to be effective rarely occur in children below the age of 12.

Geriatric Use: A limited number of patients at or above 60 years of age (n ~ 396) have been treated with oxiconazole nitrate cream in US and non-US clinical trials. The number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety. The adverse reactions reported with oxiconazole nitrate cream in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients. Based on available data, no adjustment of dosage of oxiconazole nitrate cream in geriatric patients is warranted.

### Trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis and tinea corporis: treatment and follow-up of four affected family members [^115pwSLZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

We report a Caucasian family of two veterinary practitioners and their two children, ages 2 years and 6 months, simultaneously infected with the dermatophyte Trichophyton tonsurans, causing tinea capitis and tinea corporis in the children and tinea corporis in the parents. The parents and older child were successfully treated with oral terbinafine. The infant clinically responded to treatment with topical terbinafine and ketoconazole shampoo but presented with recurrent tinea capitis 12 months later, from which T. tonsurans was cultured. At this time, scalpbrush samples from the other family members failed to culture any fungi, and neither were fungi isolated from the family hairbrushes. The infant then received oral terbinafine, resulting in clinical and mycologic cure. After a further 12 months follow-up, there has been no mycologic evidence of recurrence in any family member.

### Common tinea infections in children [^11658ib2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Six novel antimycotics [^1167o1c7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We have reviewed six new antimycotic agents which have potential applications for human cutaneous and mucosal diseases. Information on these six drugs was obtained via an English language search of PubMed through the US National Library of Medicine. The antimycotic agents reviewed include rilopirox, lanoconazole, NND-502, butenafine, eberconazole and voriconazole. Rilopirox is a synthetic pyridone derivative, related to ciclopirox, with a fungicidal action. Rilopirox is a hydrophobic, topical agent with potential application in mucosal candida infections, tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Lanoconazole, an imidazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea infections and cutaneous candidiasis. The drug has been available for clinical use in Japan since 1994 and once-daily application to affected areas is recommended. In addition to its antifungal effect, animal data suggest that application of lanoconazole 0.5 or 1% cream is associated with accelerated wound healing. NND-502, a stereoselective analog of lanoconazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea pedis infection. NND-502 appears to be more effective in inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis than lanoconazole or bifonazole and clinical trials comparing these agents are awaited. Butenafine is the first member of a new class of antifungals, the benzylamine derivatives, and has been approved for topical use in Japan (since 1992) and the US. Butenafine has a potent fungicidal action and the drug has been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Butenafine has also been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory action after topical application and this may offer potential benefit over other topical antifungal agents. Eberconazole, an imidazole derivative, is a topical antifungal agent that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials in patients with tinea infections. Preliminary data indicate that the eberconazole is effective against some triazole-resistant yeasts such as Candida krusei and Candida glabrata. Voriconazole is an azole antifungal derivative of fluconazole. The drug is available in both oral and parenteral formulations. Oral voriconazole 200mg twice daily has been effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis and apergillosis in immunocompromised patients. After 12 weeks' treatment, a similar dosage of the drug elicited a positive response in 69% of nonimmunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis.

### Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing griseofulvin and terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis [^116TRXhA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis but newer antifungal agents, particularly terbinafine, are increasingly being used because of their shorter duration of treatment and more consistent absorption rates.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy of oral griseofulvin and oral terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Skin Group Ongoing Skin Trials Register was performed up to January 2010 for randomized controlled trials comparing griseofulvin and terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis in immunocompetent patients. The primary outcome measure was the complete cure rate. The mycological and clinical cure rates and adverse effects were secondary outcome measures. Pooling of treatment effect was accomplished using a random effects model and the I(2) test was used to check for heterogeneity among the studies.

Results

Seven studies involving 2163 subjects were included. There was no significant difference in efficacy between griseofulvin (mean duration of treatment 8 weeks, range 6–12 weeks) and terbinafine (mean duration of treatment 4 weeks, range 2–6 weeks); odds ratio = 1.22 favoring terbinafine (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.785–1.919; p = 0.37). In the pooled analysis of 5 studies in which Trichophyton species were the predominant (≥ 65%) pathogenic dermatophyte, terbinafine showed a trend toward greater efficacy (odds ratio 1.49; 95% CI = 0.975–2.277; p = 0.065). Subgroup analysis revealed that terbinafine was more efficacious than griseofulvin in treating Trichophyton species (1.616; 95% CI = 1.274–2.051; P < .001) and griseofulvin was more efficacious than terbinafine in treating Microsporum species (0.408; 95% CI = 0.254–0.656; P < .001). Both griseofulvin and terbinafine demonstrated good safety profiles in the studies.

Limitations

Data on efficacy of griseofulvin and terbinafine for separate groups of Trichophyton and Microsporum species were not available from every study. In the subgroup analysis of Microsporum species, data from only 3 studies were available.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggests that terbinafine is more efficacious than griseofulvin in treating tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species, whereas griseofulvin is more efficacious than terbinafine in treating tinea capitis caused by Microsporum species.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^113eJgSZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dermatophytosis is a superficial mycosis of the skin, hair, and nails caused by dermatophytes, which are keratinophilic fungi. Trichophyton species causes the majority of dermatophyte infections. Infections are acquired through contact with infected humans, animals, soil, or contaminated fomites. Dermatophyte infections have generally responded well to first-line oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine (TRB), griseofulvin, and azoles. However, since 2016, Indian dermatologists started reporting widespread, chronic dermatophytosis resistant to first-line antifungal treatment, notably TRB. These isolates were negative for both urease and hair perforation tests (HPTs). Subsequently, these isolates were identified as Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII. In 2020, based on clinical, mycological, and molecular features, this TRB-resistant Trichophyton species belonging to T. mentagrophytes genotype VIII was described as a novel species and designated as Trichophyton indotineae to indicate the country (India) from where it was first reported. However, in a recent publication, the appropriateness of the name T. indotineae has been questioned, with two major concerns: the pejorative connotation of the term indotineae and inadequate information regarding the origin of this novel dermatophyte.

Over the past decade, India has experienced an alarming rise in T. indotineae infections.

A recent survey revealed that 78% of dermatophyte cases in the country are caused by T. indotineae. It is hypothesized that widespread availability and misuse of topical corticosteroid creams and antifungal agents in India contributed to the emergence of this infection. T. indotineae causes extensive, recalcitrant tinea cruris and tinea corporis, including atypical locations such as genitalia. Now endemic to both India and Iran, T. indotineae has also been identified in imported cases worldwide, with occasional reports of limited local transmission, highlighting the risk of epidemic spread to more countries in the near future. The rapid emergence and importation of this drug-resistant dermatophyte to many countries present a significant public health problem, highlighting the urgent need for better diagnostic tools and methods for the detection of T. indotineae and better treatment options.

### Efficacy and safety of itraconazole use in children [^114Acvru]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Current dosing regimens for itraconazole are effective, safe, and versatile for use in superficial fungal infections in children, particularly tinea capitis. Good efficacy rates have been noted in both Trichophyton and Microsporum tinea capitis infections. Itraconazole has a high affinity for keratin, and accumulates to high levels at the site of superficial fungal infections. A pulse regimen may be chosen over continuous dosing, because the accumulation persists after dosing of itraconazole has been stopped. An oral solution of itraconazole is available, and may be more convenient for children who cannot swallow capsules. The oral solution also produces good rates of efficacy, but may be associated with a somewhat higher potential for gastrointestinal adverse events than the capsules. The range of adverse events noted with itraconazole capsules or oral solution use in children is similar to the range in adults. Events are generally mild and transient. Attention must be taken to note any medications that the child is using, because itraconazole is associated with a range of potential drug interactions. This safety of use, in combination with itraconazole's wide antifungal spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties, which allow for shorter dosing regimens, may make itraconazole a suitable alternative to griseofulvin for pediatric superficial fungal infections.

### Terbinafine used safely in autoimmune hepatitis for treatment of tinea corporis [^113raPC7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Terbinafine is often considered contraindicated in those with liver disease, as one of the known side effects is hepatotoxicity. We report the first case documenting the safe use of oral terbinafine in a 77-year-old woman with stable autoimmune hepatitis presenting with extensive tinea corporis. Precautions were carried out to minimise the risk of worsening hepatotoxicity, including consultation with the patient's hepatologist, limiting terbinafine exposure to less than 6 weeks, monitoring of liver function tests, and patient education. The patient's fungal infection cleared without any signs or symptoms of worsening liver disease. The rash had not recurred 6months after treatment. When terbinafine must be used in a patient with pre-existing liver disease, we recommend considering a short course of oral terbinafine after consultation with their hepatologist, obtaining baseline liver function tests with consideration of further monitoring during treatment course, and patient education on the signs and symptoms of liver injury.

### Interventions for treating oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving treatment [^111TrSRj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but is associated with short and long-term side effects. Oral side effects, including oral candidiasis, remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and or radiotherapy.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CCTR, MEDLINE and EMBASE were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of the most recent searches May 2001: (CCTR 2001, issue 3)

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral candidiasis in people receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer. The outcomes were eradication of oral candidiasis, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and patient quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two reviewers. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. The Cochrane Oral Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using random effects models where significant heterogeneity was detected (P < 0.1).

Main Results

Eight trials involving 418 patients, satisfied the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. Only two agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for eradicating oral candidiasis. A drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole, was more beneficial than placebo in eradicating oral candidiasis (RR = 0.35 95%CI 0.20 to 0.61) and clotrimazole, at a higher dose of 50mg was more effective than a lower 10mg dose in eradicating oral candidiasis, when assessed mycologically (RR = 0.47 95%CI 0.25 to 0.89). Another trial demonstrated no difference between a 10mg dose of the partially absorbed drug, clotrimazole, and placebo. No differences were found when comparing different absorbed drugs; and comparing absorbed drugs with drugs which are not absorbed.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is weak and unreliable evidence that the absorbed drug, ketoconazole, may eradicate oral candidiasis and that a higher dose of the partially absorbed drug, clotrimazole, may give greater benefit than a lower 10mg dose, however, researchers may wish to prevent rather than treat oral candidiasis. Further well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed.

### Therapeutic options for the treatment of tinea capitis caused by trichophyton species: griseofulvin versus the new oral antifungal agents, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole [^113rosew]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is a relatively common fungal infection of childhood. Griseofulvin has been the mainstay of management. However, newer oral antifungal agents are being used more frequently. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, non-industry-sponsored study was conducted in centers in Canada and South Africa to determine the relative efficacy and safety of griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole in the treatment of tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species. The regimens for treating tinea capitis were griseofulvin microsize 20 mg/kg/day x 6 weeks, terbinafine [> 40 kg, one 250 mg tablet; 20–40 kg, 125 mg (half of a 250 mg tablet); < 20 kg, 62.5 mg (one-quarter of a 250 mg tablet)] x 2–3 weeks, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day x 2–3 weeks, and fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day x 2–3 weeks. Patients were asked to return at weeks 4, 8, and 12 from the start of the study. Griseofulvin was administered for 6 weeks and the final evaluation was at week 12. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole were administered for 2 weeks and the patient evaluated 4 weeks from the start of therapy. At this time, if clinically indicated, one extra week of therapy was given. There were 200 patients randomized to four treatment groups (50 in each group). At the final evaluation at week 12, the number of evaluable patients were griseofulvin, 46; terbinafine, 48; itraconazole, 46; and fluconazole, 46. Patients who discontinued therapy or were lost to follow-up were griseofulvin, 1/3; itraconazole, 0/4; terbinafine, 0/4; and fluconazole, 0/4. The causative organisms were Trichophyton tonsurans and T. violaceum species. Patients were regarded as effectively treated at week 12 if there was mycologic cure and either clinical cure or only a few residual symptoms. Effective treatment was recorded in, intention to treat, griseofulvin (46 of 50, 92.0%), terbinafine (47 of 50, 94.0%), itraconazole (43 of 50, 86.0%), and fluconazole (42 of 50, 84.0%) (p = 0.33). Adverse effects were reported only in the griseofulvin group (gastrointestinal effects in six patients). Discontinuation from therapy due to adverse effects occurred only in the griseofulvin group (nausea in one patient). For the treatment of tinea capitis caused by the Trichophyton species, in this study, griseofulvin given for 6 weeks is similar in efficacy to terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole given for 2–3 weeks. Each of the agents has a favorable adverse-effects profile.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^1138Uspt]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

Question 3: Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks

Answers:
A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. A topical antifungal agent alone would not be appropriate, given the extensive areas of involvement and previous extended treatment with topical corticosteroids.
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks — Correct. Oral terbinafine is one of the most effective treatments for tinea imbricata and tinea pseudoimbricata. Oral antifungal therapy can be combined with topical antifungals for an enhanced cure rate.
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. Although oral ketoconazole may be effective in the treatment of dermatophytosis, the Food and Drug Administration has applied a black-box warning because of the risk of serious hepatotoxicity potentially requiring liver transplant. The oral form of this medication is not indicated to treat skin or nail infections. It is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver failure.
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Although topical corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens, their use in tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata would be expected to worsen the disease.
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks — Incorrect. Oral corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens but would not be indicated for the treatment of tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata. Systemic immunosuppression could potentially worsen the progression of a dermatophyte infection.

Monitoring and adverse events, including IRIS — topical and azole antifungal safety considerations include that no adverse effects have been reported with oral nystatin for treatment of oral candidiasis, though bitter taste may affect adherence. Azole drugs have relatively low toxicity but inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (ketoconazole has the strongest inhibitory effect) and can substantially interact with other drugs; the potential for drug interactions, particularly with ARV drugs such as protease inhibitors, should be carefully evaluated before initiation of therapy (strong, low). The most frequent adverse effects of azole drugs are gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting.

### Inappropriate antifungal prescribing may Be driving… [^113uuqG7]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on February 11, 2024 A novel antifungal-resistant tinea species. T. indotineae's appearance correlates with a high incidence of topical antifungal use in the United States, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that physicians confirm the presence of tinea before prescribing these medications and eliminate the use of combination topical antifungal/corticosteroid products. Tinea corporis, often referred to colloquially as ringworm because of its annular appearance, is a "common infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophyte molds. " The differential diagnosis of tinea corporis's classic erythematous, raised, scaly ring is extensive and includes annular psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and granuloma annulare.

Of those, 15% were antifungal prescriptions for clotrimazole/betamethasone dipropionate, which was of particular concern to the authors given the speculation that combination topical antifungal/corticosteroid products are a primary driver of antifungal-resistant tinea species such as T. indotineae. The authors of this report urge clinicians to instead use "antifungal monotherapy, with a short course of low-potency corticosteroid treatment added if needed for symptoms such as severe pruritis". A 2014 AFP article on "Diagnosis and Management of Tinea Infections" includes a detailed description of how to perform a potassium hydroxide preparation to confirm a tinea corporis diagnosis before prescribing a topical antifungal.

The article reminds readers that topical butenafine or terbinafine are more efficacious for ringworm compared with topical clotrimazole or miconazole; it also discourages the use of combination topical antifungal/corticosteroid products "because they can aggravate fungal infections". If you are concerned that a treatment-resistant case of tinea corporis might be caused by T. indotineae, the CDC advises contacting your local public health department for assistance. Finally, we can help to curb the spread of superficial tinea infections by reminding patients to shower after exercise, not walk barefoot in locker rooms or public showers, not share sports equipment, and change socks and underwear at least once a day.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in children with HIV infection — Systemic therapy with 1 of the oral azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole) for 7 to 14 days is recommended for moderate to severe OPC, and oral fluconazole is more effective than nystatin suspension and is the recommended treatment when systemic therapy is used (strong, high). For fluconazole-refractory OPC, itraconazole oral solution should be used; itraconazole solution has efficacy comparable to fluconazole and can be used to treat OPC, although it is less well tolerated than fluconazole (weak, low). Because absorption is variable, neither itraconazole capsules nor ketoconazole tablets are recommended for treating OPC if fluconazole or itraconazole solutions are available (strong, moderate). Additional choices for fluconazole-refractory OPC include voriconazole or posaconazole, or IV treatment with amphotericin B or an echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin), if required.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^113QBoZe]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^1155aQtR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Terbinafine is the most commonly prescribed oral antifungal medicine approved to treat tinea unguium. The recommended regimen for toenail tinea unguium is 125 mg daily for 24 weeks in Japan. In daily clinical practice, oral antifungal drugs are effective in many cases; however, in 5.6% (14/247) of cases in our clinic, onychomycosis did not respond to oral terbinafine therapy during the 2‐year study period from 2016 to 2017. One reason for this might be the presence of terbinafine‐resistant dermatophytes. In 2019, we presented a case of tinea unguium caused by a terbinafine‐resistant Trichophyton rubrum. Terbinafine is an allylamine derivative that inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), thus inhibiting functional fungal cell membrane development. The mutated SQLE alleles led to Phe397Leu substitution in the T. rubrum SQLE proteins. Our clinic obtained three terbinafine‐resistant T. rubrum strains (3/95, 3.2%, Leu393Phe substitution) in June 2020.

Although onychomycosis caused by non‐dermatophytes occurs at varying frequencies according to the geographic location, in developed countries, approximately 10% of onychomycoses are caused by non‐dermatophyte moulds. We identified 13 (0.5%) cases of non‐dermatophyte onychomycosis among 2591 onychomycoses in 106703 outpatients over the past 5 years (January 2015–December 2019). The pathogens were Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Botryosphaeria dothidea, which is closely related phylogenetically to Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. Non‐dermatophyte moulds showed a poor response to terbinafine.

Efinaconazole 10% solution is recommended for patients with mild to moderate tinea unguium and assigned a grade of B in Japan. Efinaconazole is a triazole derivative that inhibits lanosterol 14α‐demethylase and has a low potential to induce drug resistance in dermatophytes. Furthermore, it shows a broad spectrum of antifungal activities in vitro and used to treat patients with non‐dermatophyte mould onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, and S. brevicaulis.

### New treatments for tinea capitis [^1115H7Vs]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tinea capitis, a dermatophyte infection involving the hair shaft on the scalp, is primarily a disease of preadolescent children. The predominant pathogen varies according to the geographical location. Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum canis account for the majority of infections in north America and certain parts of Europe. The current standard of care for the treatment of tinea capitis in the USA is oral griseofulvin, but evidence is accumulating that some of the newer antifungal agents may also be useful.

Recent Findings

The newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole seem to be effective, safe, and have the advantage of a shorter treatment duration. Although a significant number of clinical studies and reports have documented experience with terbinafine and itraconazole for the treatment of tinea capitis, it should be noted that only a few trials have been conducted utilizing fluconazole. Both 2% ketoconazole and 1% selenium sulfide shampoos are often recommended as adjuvant topical therapy.

Summary

Currently, many experts consider griseofulvin to be the drug of choice for tinea capitis. Short-term terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole therapy have been shown to be comparable in efficacy and safety with griseofulvin. Regular epidemiological surveillance of causative fungal organisms in the community and their antifungal susceptibility is an essential component in the management of this condition.

### Oral therapy for onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^116mFGYf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Onychomycosis is a very common fungal infection of the nail apparatus; however, it is very hard to treat, even when the causative agent is identified, and usually requires prolonged systemic antifungal therapy. Until the 1990s, oral treatment options included only griseofulvin and ketoconazole, and the cure rate was very low. New generations of antimycotics, such as fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine have improved treatment success.

Methods

Literature was identified by performing a PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) search. Prospective and randomized clinical trials were chosen to be included in this review. Forty-six trials were included.

Results

Fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine are effective in the treatment of onychomycosis and have a good safety profile. When a dermatophyte is the pathogen, terbinafine produces the best results. For Candida and nondermatophyte infections, the azoles, mainly itraconazole, are the recommended therapy.

Conclusion

In the majority of the studies, terbinafine treatment showed a higher cure ratio than the other drugs for dermatophyte onychomycosis.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^111xaX6e]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Epidemiology of TC can be related to geographical location and social, cultural and nutritional factors: in infants, across Europe and the Mediterranean basin, M. canis remains the most common organism responsible for TC, with prevalence ranges between 0.23 and 2.6%. Trichophyton tonsurans is reported as accounting for 50–90% of dermatophyte scalp isolates in the UK and the USA. In addition, T. tonsurans has spread to both South America and West Africa. T.violaceum is the most common in Greece and Belgium.

Tinea capitis in infants likely is more common than is reported and recent literature demonstrates a significant increase. Although the incidence is low, sometimes TC is misdiagnosed and underreported, and differential diagnosis may include seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, neonatal lupus, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and syphilis. TC should be suspected in a child with alopecia, pruritus and/or persistent desquamation and thinning hair, and the scalp lesion should be investigated from a mycological point of view.

The drug of choice for the treatment of TC is griseofulvin in children. Six to twelve weeks therapy is recommended or until the patient tests negative for fungi (light microscopy and culture). However, the long period of treatment required with this antifungal drug is a significant disadvantage and leads to reduced compliance. Other oral antifungals, specifically fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and terbinafine are available and give the advantage of good safety and efficacy profiles, and shorter required duration of treatment of TC caused by Tricophyton and Microsporum. Fremerey and Nenoff reported a case of TC in a newborn caused by T. soudanense. The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluconazole and topical clotrimazole and octenidine therapy; after one week of treatment, the lesions were resolving. Oral terbinafine, which is often administered in dermatophytosis, is FDA approved only for treatment of TC in children four years of age or older. Oral ketoconazole has been suggested for treatment of dermatophyte infections where griseofulvin is not tolerated. However, Michaels et al. do not consider oral ketoconazole to be as prudent an alternative due to the higher risk of hepatotoxicity.

### Comparative study of 2% sertaconazole solution and cream formulations in patients with tinea corporis, tinea pedis interdigitalis, or a corresponding candidosis [^1157HrnE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Based on the results of numerous preclinical and clinical studies, sertaconazole can be considered a safe and effective drug for the treatment of fungal skin infections.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of a solution containing 2% sertaconazole with the well established 2% sertaconazole cream formulation in patients with tinea corporis, tinea pedis interdigitalis, or a corresponding candidosis.

Methods

This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, noninferiority therapy study. Patients received either sertaconazole solution or cream twice daily for 28 days. The full analysis set comprised 160 patients in the solution group and 153 patients in the cream group. The primary efficacy parameter was a combination of culture test result and total clinical score. Efficacy was defined by eradication of the pathogen and reduction of the total clinical score between pretreatment and the final visit.

Results

Efficacy was documented in 90.6% of patients using the solution and 88.9% of those using the cream (full analysis set). No adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Solution and cream formulations of 2% sertaconazole applied for 28 days were associated with comparable efficacy and safety in the treatment of fungal skin infections.

### Efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate, a novel oral triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of onychomycosis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^111RyyNP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Onychomycosis is one of the most common superficial fungal infections. An epidemiological survey conducted in 2011 in Japan by the Japanese Society for Medical Mycology showed that 2980 of 36 052 outpatients who visited dermatological clinics had tinea infections, with tinea pedis being most commonly reported (1930 patients), followed by tinea unguium (780). 1 In Japan, itraconazole and terbinafine hydrochloride have been clinically used as oral antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis and no new oral drugs have been approved since marketing approvals for these two agents were obtained more than 20 years ago.

Ravuconazole (RVCZ) and its prodrug, fosravuconazole L‐lysine ethanolate (F‐RVCZ), are newly developed oral antifungal agents. 2 In the early stages of clinical development, clinical studies using RVCZ in patients with onychomycosis were conducted mainly in the USA. 3 Subsequently, F‐RVCZ, a prodrug of RVCZ was discovered to have improved hydrophilicity and oral absorbability (bioavailability), and has been examined in clinical studies of onychomycosis treatment in Japan.

The mechanism underlying the antifungal activities of RVCZ is considered to involve inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, as is the case with other azole antifungals, and this activity is potently exerted against a broad spectrum of dermatophytes and pathogenic fungi, including the genera Trichophyton, Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Ravuconazole reportedly shows a lower inhibitory effect against CYP3A4, a typical hepatic metabolic enzyme, than itraconazole. 13 It also has no clinically meaningful inhibitory effects on CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, as well as none against CYP2C9, and virtually no clinically relevant inhibitory effects on transporters such as P‐glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein, suggesting that drug interactions would be of minimal concern. 14

This report provides the results of a multicenter, double‐blind, randomized study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of F‐RVCZ, as compared with a placebo, in patients with onychomycosis.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^113xs1Nj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied to affected and immediately surrounding areas once to twice daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. Oxiconazole nitrate cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed.

Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^114Ka8p4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

### Potential sexual transmission of antifungal-resistant trichophyton indotineae [^1153JJym]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytosis, also called ringworm or tinea, is a common superficial fungal skin infection most often caused by Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton fungi and often treated using over-the-counter topical antifungal agents. Oral terbinafine is a first-line antifungal treatment for extensive skin infections, which typically occur in immunocompromised or older persons. Outbreaks of extensive, recalcitrant, and frequently terbinafine-resistant dermatophytosis in immunocompetent persons are ongoing in southern Asia because of the recently emerged dermatophyte Trichophyton indotineae (formerly Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII). T. indotineae typically causes tinea faciei, corporis, or cruris; easily spreads person-to-person; and has been reported globally, including in multiple US states. Laboratory identification requires advanced molecular techniques because culture-based methods cannot distinguish T. indotineae from other Trichophyton species.

### Fungal toenail infections [^111fLAGQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 12% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, tioconazole, and topical ketoconazole.

### Limited effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine) in the current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: results of a randomized pragmatic trial [^112nwn5a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dermatophytic infections have undergone unprecedented changes in India in the recent past. Clinical trials to find out the effectiveness of the four main oral antifungal drugs are lacking.

Objectives

We tested the effectiveness of oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine in chronic and chronic relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in an investigator-initiated, randomized, pragmatic trial.

Methods

Two hundred patients with microscopy-confirmed tinea were allocated to four groups (50 patients in each group): fluconazole 5 mg kg -1 per day, griseofulvin 10 mg kg -1 per day, itraconazole 5 mg kg -1 per day and terbinafine 7·5 mg kg -1 per day. Allocation was performed by concealed block randomization and the patients were treated for 8 weeks or until cure. Effectiveness was calculated based on intention-to-treat analysis. The trial was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2017/04/008281).

Results

At 4 weeks, all drugs were similarly ineffective, with cure rates being 8% or less (P = 0·42). At 8 weeks, the numbers of patients cured were as follows: fluconazole 21 (42%), griseofulvin seven (14%), itraconazole 33 (66%) and terbinafine 14 (28%) (P < 0·001). Itraconazole was superior to fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine (adjusted P ≤ 0·048). Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure with the four treatments were not different (P ≥ 0·42). Numbers needed to treat (vs. griseofulvin), calculated on the basis of cure rates at 8 weeks, were as follows: fluconazole 4, itraconazole 2 and terbinafine 8.

Conclusions

The results show limited effectiveness of all four antifungal drugs. In view of cure rates and the number needed to treat, itraconazole is the most effective drug, followed by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin, in chronic and chronic relapsing dermatophytosis in India. What is already known about this topic? Oral antifungal drugs are considered to have a high cure rate in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei. Unprecedented changes have been noticed in the last few years in India in the morphology, course and treatment responsiveness of tinea; however, data about the effectiveness of oral antifungals are lacking. What does this study add? Our results show limited effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine) in the current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India. Among the four drugs tested, oral itraconazole is the most effective. Linked Comment: Elewski. Br J Dermatol 2020; 183:798–799.

Tinea capitis is a common fungal infection in children but rare among neonates. We present a case of a 3-week-old infant with multiple scalp lesions for 1 week. A diagnosis of tinea capitis due to Microsporum canis was made based on clinical morphology, Wood's lamp, and biopsy with a positive PAS stain. She was effectively treated with oral griseofulvin and ketoconazole shampoo.

### Oral fluconazole in the treatment of tinea versicolor [^1135sAuz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral fluconazole given at 300 mg once weekly for two weeks in the treatment of tinea versicolor. Enrolled into the study were 44 subjects with tinea versicolor, provisionally confirmed by the detection of fungal hyphae in KOH wet mounts and Wood's lamp examination. Four subjects were classified as dropouts because no information was obtained from them after the baseline visit. Subjects were treated for two weeks orally with fluconazole 300 mg weekly and followed at the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 12th weeks of treatment. The study included 40 subjects (26 males and 14 females, mean age 29 years, range 19–48 years). At the week 4 visit, 30 (75%) patients showed a complete cure and 31 (77.5%) patients showed mycologic cure. Ten (25%) patients had no significant response to therapy. At the final follow-up visit (week 12), none of the patients showing complete or mycologic cures exhibited a recurrence. No adverse effects were observed in any of the patients treated. We believe that, due to the low incidence of side effects, shorter treatment duration, and increased adaptation of the patients, fluconazole can be used in the treatment of tinea versicolor with confidence.

### Superficial fungal infections [^115cgnwJ]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis, tinea corporis, and pityriasis versicolor are common superficial fungal infections in the pediatric population.
- Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection worldwide. In North America, the cause is almost exclusively T tonsurans. Diagnosis of tinea capitis usually can be made by clinical features alone, especially when occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy is present. Skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide for microscopic examination, or a cotton swab for fungal culture, usually are diagnostic.
- Treatment of tinea capitis requires systemic antifungal therapy. Terbinafine and griseofulvin are both effective against T tonsurans and are FDA-approved for this indication in children.
- Adjunctive topical therapy for the patient and household contacts decreases transmission of this infection.
- Topical antifungal therapy usually is effective for tinea corporis and pityriasis versicolor. However, recurrences of pityriasis versicolor are common.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^116RFyhe]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug used to treat tinea unguium that was approved by the Japanese government in 2014. A phase 3 study enrolled patients with a nail involvement ratio of 20–50% (mean, 36.7%), and the complete cure rate at 52 weeks was 17.8% (117/656). Furthermore, a multicenter study including severe cases with a mean nail involvement of 49.1% showed that continuous application up to 72 weeks contributed to a relatively high cure rate of 31.1% (68/223). A recent Cochrane review of treatments for onychomycosis confirmed that high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for achieving a complete cure. Oral terbinafine at 250 mg daily for 12 weeks and oral itraconazole pulse therapy (3 cycles of 400 mg daily) are mainly applied internationally, with complete cure rates of 35% and 14%, respectively. Combination therapy can be administrated in parallel or sequentially. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are not likely to respond to the therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who have shown a poor response to initial treatment. Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. We herein report the efficacy of topical efinaconazole in sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine.

Regarding specific circumstances for tinea capitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, ESPD 2010 guidelines recommend to consider offering adjunctive topical therapies, such as selenium sulfide
or ketoconazole
shampoos and fungicidal creams or lotions to decrease the carriage of viable spores responsible for the disease contagion and reinfection and to shorten the cure rate with oral antifungals. Apply topical fungicidal cream/lotion to the lesions once daily for a week.

### Tinea capitis in an HIV-positive patient with generalized dermatophytosis [^117HnN8w]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

T rubrum is a very uncommon cause of tinea capitis in the general population, comprising 0.78% of cases worldwide, with only 127 cases reported as of 1995 according to one survey of the literature. Despite its extreme rarity, T rubrum led to a robust case of tinea capitis in this patient, likely owing to autoinoculation from generalized T rubrum dermatophytosis and onychomycosis. In contrast to other dermatophyte species, T rubrum can uniquely function as both an endothrix and an ectothrix infection in the setting of hair invasion, which may have allowed long-term colonization and development of tinea capitis in this immunocompromised patient. Microscopically, hyphae were noted exclusively on the outside of the hair shaft, suggesting ectothrix infection; this was further supported clinically by her absence of alopecia.

In widespread dermatophytosis, systemic antifungal therapy is the treatment of choice, particularly terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole. In 3 HIV-positive patients with generalized chronic dermatophytosis, treatment was successful with 7 days of oral ketoconazole, 200 mg twice daily, followed by oral ketoconazole, 200 mg daily over 24 months. However, ketoconazole is not considered first-line treatment, given the potential for severe side effects. Other reports describe clearing of widespread dermatophytosis with 12 days to 21 weeks of systemic terbinafine, with or without combination topical antimycotic therapy. Complete or near-complete recovery has also been observed within 1 to 2 months of systemic itraconazole therapy in patients with generalized dermatophytosis from T rubrum. In the patient described here, lesions resolved within 3 weeks of treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg daily.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a unique presentation of generalized dermatophytosis and tinea capitis secondary to T rubrum in a patient with HIV/AIDS. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing widespread dermatophytosis and tinea capitis in the setting of HIV infection, with the potential for T rubrum as a causative organism.

### Optimal management of fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails [^115QoBrU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are chronic and recurring conditions. Tinea capitis is a scalp infection, primarily affecting prepubescent children. Ringworm infections, such as tinea corporis and tinea cruris, involve the glabrous skin. Tinea nigra is a rare mycotic infection that may be related to travel abroad. Piedra, black or white, is limited to the hair shaft without involvement of the adjacent skin. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are dermatoses associated with yeasts of the genus Malassezia that affect the lipid-rich areas of the body. The taxonomy of the Malassezia yeasts has been revised to include nine species, eight of which have been recovered from humans. Tinea pedis, an infection of the feet and toes, is one of the most common forms of dermatophytosis. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection affecting the nail bed and nail plate; it may be chronic and can be difficult to treat. In instances where the superficial fungal infection is severe or chronic, an oral antifungal agent should be considered. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are oral antifungals that are effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^114ZvzWR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug approved in Japan for tinea unguium. Although topical treatments generally have low cure rates with a prolonged therapy period, a Cochrane review confirmed that high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for the complete cure of tinea unguium. Combination therapy is a way to improve the cure rate of onychomycosis. In this study, topical efinaconazole was administrated to 12 patients who had been treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for more than 20 weeks with little expected effect. Because terbinafine accumulates for a long time in the nail, treatment immediately followed by other drugs can be considered sequential combination therapy. During terbinafine monotherapy, the percentage involvement decreased from 53.5% to 44.0% after 37.4 weeks and the effective and cure rates were 16.7% and 0%, respectively. During sequential topical efinaconazole therapy combined with lasting terbinafine in the nail, the percentage involvement decreased from 44.0% to 18.7% after 28.4 weeks, and the effective and cure rates were 66.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The improvement rate per month of combination therapy (12.6%) was higher than that with monotherapy (2.1%) (p = 0.002). There were no serious side‐effects. This sequential combination therapy with efinaconazole was effective in poor terbinafine responders, making it a promising regimen for improving the cure rate of tinea unguium.

Regarding medical management for tinea capitis, more specifically with respect to oral antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect lack of compliance, suboptimal absorption of the drug, the relative insensitivity of the organism, and reinfection in case of treatment failure. Continue current treatment for further 2–4 weeks in cases of clinical improvement but ongoing positive mycology. Switch to second-line therapy if there has been no initial clinical improvement.

### Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat [^117Wjso3]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Superficial dermatophytoses are among the most common conditions prompting patients to seek dermatologic evaluation. The dermatophyte, T rubrum, is the most frequent cause of onychomycosis and cutaneous infection in the United States. Despite its prevalence, microbiologically proven drug resistance is rare and most patients improve with oral terbinafine. However, we have recently seen numerous cases of extensive tinea corporis from T rubrum that was initially resistant to terbinafine or recurred rapidly after a brief interval improvement. Although uncommon, these cases have been increasing in frequency, and we have seen several patients in our clinic with widespread cutaneous disease that persisted despite prolonged treatment with oral terbinafine or second-line systemic therapies (oral fluconazole or itraconazole). Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis has emerged as a public health threat in endemic areas like India. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no such cases of treatment-resistant dermatophytosis reported in the United States.

We have treated several cases of extensive and resistant T rubrum tinea corporis in otherwise healthy patients with no risk factors predisposing them to recurrent fungal infections including recent steroid use. Several patients did report a remote history of onychomycosis although most had no active nail involvement upon their initial presentation. A subset of patients initially responded to oral terbinafine and reported clearance within 2 weeks, although all noted recurrent and persistent lesions shortly after discontinuing treatment. Several patients, however, had no initial improvement with progressive disease while on therapy (Fig 1, A and B). Cultures from skin scrapings, in several cases, surprisingly resulted within a few days and showed T rubrum. Despite absence of clinical improvement, only some patients demonstrated terbinafine resistance on broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing (MIC > 0.5 μg/mL). Further workup including biopsies were unrevealing for inflammatory or alternative etiologies. Patients were switched to oral fluconazole or itraconazole in combination with topical agents. Most patients had partial improvement, although several had no clinical response despite continuous treatment on this alternative regimen.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^114dh3Nh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

Background

About 15% of the population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). Whilst there are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis the most common are between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels and sides of the foot (plantar) which is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of reinfection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects and costs of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from the beginning of these databases to January 2000. We also searched the Cochrane Controlled trials Register (Cochrane Library issue 1, 2000) the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB-Health, Health star and Economic databases. Bibliographies were searched, podiatry journals hand searched and the pharmaceutical industry and schools of podiatry contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials including participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection was done by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality assessment and data collection was also assessed by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

Twelve trials, involving 700 participants, were included. The two trials comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk difference of 52% (95% confidence intervals 33% to 71%) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole; fluconazole and either itraconazole and ketoconazole; or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo. Adverse effects were reported for all drugs, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin and that terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment.

### Effect of different itraconazole dosing regimens on cure rates, treatment duration, safety, and relapse rates in adult patients with tinea corporis / cruris: a randomized clinical trial [^115Cst9n]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

With worldwide emergence of recalcitrant and resistant dermatophytosis, itraconazole is increasingly being used as the first-line drug for treatment of tinea corporis/cruris (TCC). Apparent inadequacy with low doses has led to empirical use of higher doses and antifungal combinations.

Objective

To compare cure rates, treatment durations, safety profiles, and relapse rates of itraconazole 100, 200, and 400 mg/d for the treatment of TCC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind randomized clinical trial included adult patients with treatment-naive TCC involving at least 5% body surface area. Patients were recruited from the dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. Biweekly blinded assessments were performed until cure or treatment failure. Posttreatment follow-up of at least 8 weeks was conducted to detect relapses.

Main Outcome and Measures

Cure rates, treatment durations, safety profiles, and relapse rates were assessed. Secondary outcomes included comparison of rapidity of clinical response and cost-effectiveness between groups.

Results

Of the 149 patients assessed, the mean (SD) age was 34.3 (12.2) years, 69 patients (46.4%) were women, and 80 patients (53.6%) were men. The difference in cure rate between the 100- and 200-mg groups was statistically nonsignificant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 0.91–2.30; p = 0.12), while the difference between the 100- and 400-mg groups (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.78–4.62; P < .001) and between the 200- and 400-mg groups (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.28–3.09; p = 0.002) was statistically significant. Mean (SD) treatment durations were statistically significantly different between the 100- and 400-mg groups (7.7 [4.7] weeks vs 5.2 [2.6] weeks; p = 0.03) and between the 200- and 400-mg groups (7.2 [3.8] weeks vs 5.2 [2.6] weeks; p = 0.004), but the difference between the 100- and 200-mg groups was not statistically significant. A total of 55 patients (47.4%) relapsed after treatment. Relapse rates were comparable across groups. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Treatment with the 200-mg dose incurred a 63% higher cost and 400 mg a 120% higher cost over 100 mg in achieving cure.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, high overall efficacy was observed among the 3 itraconazole doses for treatment of TCC, but with prolonged treatment durations and considerable relapse rates. Treatment with the 200- and 100-mg doses did not differ significantly in efficacy or treatment durations, while 400 mg scored over the other 2 on these outcomes. Considerable additional cost is incurred in achieving cure with the 200- and 400-mg doses.
