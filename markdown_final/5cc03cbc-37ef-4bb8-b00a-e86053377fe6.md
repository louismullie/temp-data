## Question

In an 82-year-old woman with normal hemoglobin and hematocrit but an MCV of 105, how should this be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret isolated macrocytosis (MCV 105 fL) with normal hemoglobin/hematocrit in an 82-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the abnormality and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the MCV is truly elevated and not spurious with a reticulocyte count and smear. Next, I will evaluate common reversible causes in older adults, including B12 deficiency, folate status, alcohol, medications, thyroid disease, and liver disease. After that, I need to consider hemolysis/reticulocytosis and when bone marrow disorders like MDS enter the differential. Then, I should review additional targeted tests, including renal function, CRP, and possibly copper, and reflect on clonal hematopoiesis. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized action plan and monitoring strategy with treatment contingencies and patient counseling points [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh].

> Let me first confirm the hematologic abnormality and its import. An MCV of 105 fL meets the definition of macrocytosis (> 100 fL), and in this case it is isolated because hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal; in older adults, even isolated macrocytosis can be an early signal of underlying pathology and warrants a structured evaluation rather than attribution to aging alone [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh].

> Wait, let me verify that this macrocytosis is real and not artifactual. I need a reticulocyte count and a careful peripheral smear review, because reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs (up to roughly 126 fL) and can raise the automated MCV in brisk erythropoiesis, and cold agglutinins can cause RBC clumping and spurious macrocytosis; the smear will also provide morphologic clues such as macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils suggesting a megaloblastic process, dysplasia suggesting MDS, or target cells suggesting liver disease [^111etdk1] [^111bDP7o].

> Next, I should review vitamin B12 status because in patients over 60, pernicious anemia and other B12-deficient states are common and can present first with macrocytosis before anemia. I need serum B12 and, if borderline (roughly 200–300 pg/mL), methylmalonic acid to confirm functional deficiency; given low cost and safety, a diagnostic therapeutic trial of B12 is reasonable in borderline cases, and I should remember that B12 deficiency impairs DNA synthesis and produces megaloblastic changes on smear [^113AAYBz] [^1123nFSh].

> Hold on, I should not overlook folate, but I need to be judicious. True folate deficiency is uncommon with dietary fortification unless there is severe malnutrition, alcohol overuse, or malabsorption; serum folate reflects recent intake and can be misleading, so if suspicion remains after excluding cobalamin deficiency, RBC folate can better reflect longer-term status, though availability varies [^1123nFSh] [^113zezNq].

> I need to ensure I do not mask a cobalamin deficiency with folate or folinic acid. Folic acid or leucovorin can correct hematologic abnormalities while allowing neurologic damage from untreated B12 deficiency to progress, so I should not empirically give folate before B12 deficiency is excluded and, if present, treated first [^1135fGzx] [^114eBn4W] [^115t4cQ9].

> Let me consider alcohol as a contributor. Alcohol can directly impair erythropoiesis and is a frequent cause of macrocytosis, often coexisting with folate deficiency; I should take a targeted history and check liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, and GGT, to support this possibility and to screen for concurrent liver disease [^111bDP7o] [^117QZNk1].

> I should double-check for medication-induced macrocytosis. Antifolates such as methotrexate and trimethoprim, anticonvulsants like phenytoin and valproate, antiretrovirals like zidovudine, and cytotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea and azathioprine can all cause macrocytosis; a meticulous medication reconciliation, including supplements, is essential, and with azathioprine I need to be alert to TPMT/NUDT15-associated myelotoxicity if cytopenias develop [^117QZNk1] [^115Bz1Pw] [^1145hSdo].

> I need to check thyroid function. Hypothyroidism is a recognized cause of macrocytosis in older adults, and guidelines recommend obtaining a TSH as part of the standard anemia/macrocytosis workup; even without anemia, it is a high-yield reversible contributor [^1123nFSh] [^111bDP7o].

> I will now examine the possibility of liver disease. Hepatic disorders alter RBC membrane lipid content and hydration, leading to macrocytosis and sometimes target cells on smear; a comprehensive metabolic panel helps assess for liver dysfunction in this context [^111bDP7o] [^114hL7Ur].

> But wait, what if reticulocytosis is driving the MCV up from hemolysis or recent blood loss. I should obtain a reticulocyte count and, if elevated, evaluate for hemolysis with LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a direct antiglobulin test as indicated, because reactive reticulocytosis can transiently increase MCV even without an intrinsic macrocytic process [^111bDP7o] [^111kLtJd].

> Next, I should review when bone marrow disorders enter consideration. Primary marrow dysplasias such as myelodysplastic syndrome can present with macrocytosis and dysplasia on smear, but in an older adult with isolated macrocytosis, normal hemoglobin and hematocrit, and no other cytopenias or dysplastic findings, an immediate bone marrow biopsy is usually not indicated; however, if red flags emerge — such as additional cytopenias, dysplasia or blasts on smear, severe or worsening anemia, or a compelling family history — or if macrocytosis persists or progresses without explanation, marrow evaluation with cytogenetics and next-generation sequencing becomes appropriate [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought an MCV above 96 fL alone might mandate a bone marrow biopsy, but I should verify that nuance. The red flag framework is used to escalate evaluation in unexplained anemia; in the absence of anemia and cytopenias, a measured, stepwise approach with repeat CBC and smear review after addressing reversible causes is reasonable, while maintaining vigilance for evolving marrow disease that would then prompt biopsy with full morphologic and genetic workup [^1123nFSh].

> Next, I should review additional targeted screens that refine the differential. Checking eGFR and CRP helps identify contributory CKD or inflammation, and although CKD classically produces normocytic anemia, patients with kidney disease — especially on hemodialysis — can display macrocytosis and higher MCV has been associated with worse outcomes, underscoring the value of a broad systemic assessment in older adults with macrocytosis [^1123nFSh] [^112ZPDVr] [^114SzkiY].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of clonal hematopoiesis. I initially considered macrocytosis as a general marker for clonal hematopoiesis and nascent hematologic malignancy risk, but I need to correct that impression; recent cohort data suggest macrocytosis itself is not broadly associated with clonal hematopoiesis, although SF3B1 mutations are linked to elevated MCV, while a high RDW correlates more strongly with clonal features and cytopenias, so my index of suspicion should be tailored accordingly [^11271YXK].

> Let me synthesize the likely etiologies in this patient after ruling out artifacts. The most probable reversible causes to prioritize are vitamin B12 deficiency including pernicious anemia, medication effects, alcohol use, hypothyroidism, and liver disease, with myelodysplastic syndrome remaining on the differential if macrocytosis persists or additional cytopenias or dysplasia develop despite correction of reversible factors [^113AAYBz] [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh].

> I should now outline a pragmatic, test-first plan. Immediate steps include reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, serum B12 with methylmalonic acid if borderline, TSH, and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver tests, alongside a complete medication and alcohol history; RBC folate can follow if cobalamin deficiency is excluded yet suspicion remains, and I should avoid empiric folate until B12 status is clarified to prevent masking neurologic toxicity [^1123nFSh] [^113zezNq] [^1135fGzx].

> If the initial evaluation is unrevealing, I need to ensure close follow-up. Repeating the CBC and smear in 3 to 6 months helps detect trajectory; persistent or rising MCV, new cytopenias, or dysplastic morphologies should prompt bone marrow evaluation with aspirate/biopsy, cytogenetics, and NGS to assess for MDS or other marrow failure syndromes [^1123nFSh] [^111bDP7o].

> If B12 deficiency is confirmed, I should treat and monitor response. Older adults with intact absorption often respond to oral B12 at 1000 μg daily, while pernicious anemia or malabsorption requires parenteral replacement; I should look for a reticulocyte rise within about a week and counsel that neurologic symptoms are reversible with timely therapy, taking care to correct severe deficiency gradually in high-risk patients [^113AAYBz].

> Finally, I should communicate clearly with the patient about next steps. I will discuss alcohol moderation, review and adjust medications that can cause macrocytosis where feasible, reinforce the importance of follow-up labs, and explain that although isolated macrocytosis is not an emergency, it is a clinically significant marker that deserves careful evaluation to uncover and correct reversible causes while staying alert to evolving marrow disease in an older adult [^111bDP7o] [^1123nFSh].

In an 82-year-old woman with normal hemoglobin and hematocrit and an MCV of 105 fL, the most likely causes are **early myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)**, **medication effects** (hydroxyurea, methotrexate, azathioprine [^1145hSdo], valproic acid, zidovudine) [^117QZNk1], or **alcohol use** [^111bDP7o]. Less common causes include **hypothyroidism [^117QZNk1], liver disease, or reticulocytosis** [^111bDP7o]. Evaluate with a focused history, medication review, assessment of alcohol use and nutrition, and laboratory tests including B12, folate, TSH, LFTs, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear [^113HMPXu]. If unexplained or persistent, consider bone marrow biopsy to assess for MDS or other marrow disorders [^1123nFSh].

## Differential diagnosis of isolated macrocytosis

Macrocytosis without anemia is **common in older adults** [^11185Ssu] and often reflects early or mild disease, medication effects, or alcohol use. The differential includes:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Less common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency [^117QZNk1] | - Copper deficiency |
| Medications | - Hydroxyurea <br/> - Methotrexate <br/> - Azathioprine <br/> - Valproic acid <br/> - Zidovudine [^117QZNk1] | ∅ |
| Alcohol use | - Chronic alcohol consumption [^111bDP7o] | ∅ |
| Bone marrow disorders | - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [^111bDP7o] | - Aplastic anemia <br/> - Pure red cell aplasia [^113kg9kP] [^113iLuTB] |
| Endocrine disorders | - Hypothyroidism [^111bDP7o] | ∅ |
| Liver disease | - Chronic liver disease <br/> - Cirrhosis [^111bDP7o] | ∅ |
| Hemolysis/reticulocytosis | - Hemolytic anemia <br/> - Recent blood loss [^1123nFSh] | ∅ |

## Clinical significance of isolated macrocytosis in elderly patients

Isolated macrocytosis in the elderly often signals **early or mild disease, medication effects, or alcohol use** [^117QZNk1]. It can precede anemia in MDS or other marrow disorders and may reflect subclinical B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^1123nFSh]. Persistent macrocytosis warrants evaluation to detect treatable causes and prevent progression.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

A structured evaluation includes a **history and physical examination** with review of medications, alcohol use, nutrition, and symptoms of anemia, neuropathy, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^113HMPXu]. Laboratory testing should include CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, vitamin B12 and folate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and liver function tests (LFTs) [^113AAYBz]. If hemolysis is suspected, obtain lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin [^111kLtJd]. Additional tests include methylmalonic acid and homocysteine when B12/folate levels are borderline [^113zezNq]. Consider bone marrow biopsy if macrocytosis is persistent or unexplained, especially with cytopenias or dysplasia [^1123nFSh].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**.

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Treat B12/folate deficiency with supplementation [^113zezNq].
- **Medication-induced macrocytosis**: Adjust or stop the offending drug when possible [^117QZNk1].
- **Alcohol-related macrocytosis**: Counsel on cessation and provide support [^117QZNk1].
- **Bone marrow disorders**: Refer to hematology; consider supportive care, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or hypomethylating agents for MDS [^113AAYBz].
- **Endocrine or liver disease**: Treat the underlying condition [^113AAYBz].

---

## Prognosis and clinical outcomes

Prognosis depends on the **cause** and response to treatment. Nutritional or medication-related macrocytosis often resolves with therapy [^1123nFSh]. Persistent macrocytosis, especially with cytopenias or dysplasia, may indicate MDS or other marrow disorders and requires close follow-up and hematology referral.

Isolated macrocytosis (MCV 105 fL) with normal hemoglobin and hematocrit in an 82-year-old woman **most often reflects early MDS, medication effects, or alcohol use**; a focused history, appropriate labs, and selective marrow evaluation guide diagnosis and management.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and levels of vitamin B12 and folate with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. Additionally, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which could be from various sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary by laboratory, and testing is not widely available everywhere. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR, and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate the determination of other contributory causes of anemia, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10^9/L), a family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics, with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate potential underlying causes.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia, demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias — including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders — are some of the more common causes.

### Imuran [^1145hSdo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Severe cytopenias, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, macrocytic anemia, and/or pancytopenia, may occur in patients being treated with Imuran. Severe bone marrow suppression is dose-related and may be more pronounced in renal transplant patients experiencing homograft rejection. It is recommended that patients on Imuran have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly during the second and third months of treatment, and then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. A prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count or other evidence of bone marrow depression. It is important to note that leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore, the dose should not be intentionally increased to lower the white blood cell count.

Patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency may be at an increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity when receiving conventional doses of Imuran. Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity while receiving azathioprine. In cases of severe myelosuppression, consider evaluation for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency. Consider alternative therapy for patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency.

### Investigation of microcytosis: A comprehensive approach [^111CfBTL]. European Journal of Haematology (1996). High credibility.

Microcytosis, a condition characterized by smaller than normal red blood cells, can arise from various causes. These include sideroblastic anemia, vitamin C deficiency, iron deficiency, heterozygous beta thalassemia, and homozygous beta thalassemia. Additionally, microcytosis can result from dialysis-related aluminum toxicity, vitamin A deficiency, copper deficiency, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. It is also associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 5, sickle cell-thalassemia disease, hemoglobin H disease, hemoglobin E disease, Hemoglobin Bart's, beta thalassemia minor, and alpha thalassemia trait.

### Hypersegmented neutrophils and oval macrocytes in the setting of Bdeficiency and pancytopaenia [^113CeDTX]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a recognized pathology in several populations, with a particular prevalence in an older adult population. We present two cases whereby vitamin B12 deficiency is the causative factor in marked pancytopaenia. Oval macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils were noted on both peripheral blood samples, which are characteristic findings in macrocytic anaemia due to B12 deficiency. Distinct underlying pathologies were identified in both cases: food-cobalamin malabsorption and pernicious anaemia. Parenteral vitamin B12 supplementation resulted in marked reticulocytosis and a rapid improvement of haematological indices in both cases.

We present this series to serve as a reminder that B12 deficiency can present as life-threatening pancytopaenia. It has multiple underlying pathologies, defined risk populations, and characteristic blood film findings which can guide investigations, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^112Ygq5d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old active duty African American male presented to the emergency room 18 days post COVID pneumonia infection, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, and subjective weight loss. He stated that his initial symptoms of dysgeusia, anosmia, headache, and fever had previously resolved since his initial COVID-positive test. He had no family history of blood disorders and had no significant past medical or surgical history. He was on no medications or supplements at the time of admission.

Initial investigation with a complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin (HGB) of 4.1 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 4.1 g/dL, and platelets (PLTs) of 64 × 10(9)/L. His anemia was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 95.3) and normochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] 32.0). His leukopenia was lymphocyte predominant (55% lymphocytes, 33% granulocytes, and 6% monocytes). A peripheral smear showed moderate oval macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and atypical lymphocytes, most consistent with a hypocellular sample with dilution. The patient was admitted to the medicine ward for blood transfusion, volume resuscitation, and further workup.

Diagnostic evaluation for hypo-proliferation, hemolysis, and malnutrition was initiated. There was concern for a hemolytic process, so a bilirubin level was obtained, which was elevated at 3.4 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin predominance at 1.8 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was elevated, suggesting a hemolytic anemia. However, his reticulocyte index was 0.13, consistent with hypo-proliferation.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116sTZky]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

When evaluating the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient's microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost four years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than an iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

- **Learning points**:
	- Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation.
	- Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes, and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin.
	- Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology.
	- Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis in a patient with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia [^111xC6aD]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

Herein is described the case of a young woman presenting with iron overload and macrocytosis. The initial diagnosis was hereditary hemochromatosis. Severe anemia developed following a few phlebotomies, and she was also found to have congenital dyserythropoietic anemia that, though not completely typical, resembled type II. Only genetic testing allowed the definition of the coexistence of the two diseases, both responsible for the iron overload. This report points out the need to consider congenital dyserythropoietic anemia in patients with hemochromatosis and unexplained macrocytosis and, conversely, to check for the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and severe iron overload. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in a patient affected by congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^117F7MuX]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis occurs in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients; however, its significance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, identify its clinical associations, and determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of 150 stable, adult CHD patients followed for nine months. Macrocytosis was defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) > 97 fl. We analyzed MCV as a continuous variable, in tertiles, and using a cutoff point of 102 fl.

- **Results**: The mean MCV was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl, with a range of 66–120 fl. MCV was normally distributed. Ninety-two (61%) of patients had an MCV > 97 fl, and 45 (30%) > 102 fl. Patients were not B12 or folate deficient, in those with available data, and three patients with an MCV > 102 fl had hypothyroidism. In a logistic regression analysis, an MCV > 102 fl was associated with a higher Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index (CACI) and higher ratios of darbepoetin alfa to hemoglobin (Hb), calculated as [(weekly darbepoetin alfa dose in micrograms per kg body weight / Hb in g/L)×1000]. There were 23 deaths at nine months in this study. Unadjusted MCV > 102 fl was associated with mortality (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.42–7.39, P = 0.005). Adjusting for the CACI, an MCV > 102 fl was still associated with mortality (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07–5.71, P = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients. Future studies will need to be conducted to confirm this finding.

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^116QKnvN]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Classic idiopathic presentation aside, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As a consequence, treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario.

We propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications in regard to the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^117299xv]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

MCV showed good specificity but low sensitivity in diagnosing reduced iron stores. Thus, MCV is a useful tool for clinicians to strengthen suspicion of iron deficiency, but a normal or high MCV does not rule out iron deficiency. In our patient population, underlying bone marrow diseases can increase the MCV and thus reduce its utility. In the general population, MCV is more accurate; however, the low sensitivity of MCV is an issue even in more general populations: in older age, most patients with IDA can have normal MCVs.

The diagnostic efficacy of a test is often measured by its sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. However, in clinical practice, the PPV and NPV are the most relevant markers. PPV and NPV can be calculated for a cutoff with known sensitivity and specificity if the preprobability is known. In a clinical setting, the preprobability is estimated from the patient's background information (e.g. age, sex, medication, chronic medical conditions), symptoms, clinical tests, and other diagnostic tests. For example, an 18-year-old female in the United States has approximately 35% preprobability of iron deficiency, and if she is known to have heavy menstrual bleeding and fatigue, the preprobability is even higher.

To illustrate the significance of preprobability, we presented PPV and NPV in a novel way in a figure as a continuous function of different preprobabilities (Figure 5; shown in linear scale in supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 9). We show that ruling in iron deficiency with 95% PPV is feasible, at least for ferritin. However, ruling out iron deficiency with this methodology remains challenging.

### Diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia [^115scVYY]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of the concept of aplastic anemia (AA) by Paul Ehrlich in 1888, and despite a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in this disease, a clear delimitation among bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes is still a matter of debate. The diagnosis of AA can be difficult due to overlapping morphological characteristics with other BM failure disorders. This paper reviews critical data relevant to the diagnosis of acquired AA and recommends steps and main considerations to determine the severity and characterization of the disease. The diagnostic challenge in differentiating between AA and hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes is also addressed. The definition of response criteria to treatment is part of the diagnostic tasks and is included in this review, along with an overview of novel tools for the diagnosis of AA.

### Sanjad-Sakati syndrome with macrocytic anemia and failure to thrive: a case from South Jordan [^112NZMGb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background: Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (SSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a deletion mutation (155–166del) in exon 3 of the TBCE gene on chromosome 1q42–43. The syndrome is characterized by primary hypoparathyroidism, typical dysmorphic features, and severe growth retardation.

- **Case presentation**: We encountered a 2-year-old boy with hypocalcemia, failure to thrive, and macrocytic anemia. The patient had the characteristic features of SSS and genetic testing confirmed that he was homozygous for the TBCE mutation. Although malabsorption was initially considered the cause of his symptoms, the results did not confirm that diagnosis. Our patient had cow milk protein allergy and folic acid deficiency, which have not been described in previous SSS cases. It was difficult to treat the patient's hyperphosphatemia, and we ultimately selected sevelamer treatment, which was tolerated well and improved his hypocalcemia.

- **Conclusions**: SSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypocalcemia, dysmorphism, and failure to thrive.

### Lysinuric protein intolerance presenting as pancytopenia and splenomegaly mimicking acute leukaemia: a case report [^112zht66]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Lysinuric protein intolerance is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to autosomal recessive mutations of the SLC7A7 gene. Affected patients commonly present with protein-rich food intolerance, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, muscle hypotonia, and lung involvement due to impaired intestinal absorption and excessive urinary excretion of dibasic amino acids. Presentation with splenomegaly and cytopenia without other features has not been reported. Here we report a Sri Lankan girl with lysinuric protein intolerance presenting with pancytopenia and splenomegaly mimicking acute leukaemia.

- **Case presentation**: A two-year and six-month-old Sri Lankan girl presented with persistent pancytopenia following a viral illness. She was asymptomatic without vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or irritability. Physical examination revealed pallor and isolated firm splenomegaly measuring 2 cm. Growth parameters and other system examinations were normal. Full blood count revealed anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The blood picture showed a mix of hypochromic microcytic and normochromic normocytic red cells with occasional pencil cells and macrocytes. Bone marrow examination was normal except for occasional megaloblasts; however, serum vitamin B12 and red blood cell folate were normal. The metabolic screen showed a high anion gap compensated metabolic acidosis, high lactate, and ketosis. Genetic mutation analysis using whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants of the SLC7A7 gene, confirming the diagnosis of lysinuric protein intolerance.

### Anemia in the elderly [^114sBarU]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia should not be accepted as an inevitable consequence of aging. A cause is found in approximately 80 percent of elderly patients. The most common causes of anemia in the elderly are chronic disease and iron deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and myelodysplastic syndrome are among other causes of anemia in the elderly. Serum ferritin is the most useful test to differentiate iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease.

Not all cases of vitamin B12 deficiency can be identified by low serum levels. The serum methylmalonic acid level may be useful for the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency is effectively treated with oral vitamin B12 supplementation. Folate deficiency is treated with 1 mg of folic acid daily.

### Rationale for revision and proposed changes of the WHO diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis [^114UXnEC]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The key diagnostic issue in polycythemia vera (PV) is determining which red cell parameters, such as hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct), can be more conveniently used as surrogates for an increased red cell mass as measured by the isotope test. According to the 2007/2008 updated WHO classification, the first major diagnostic criterion requires one of the following four components:

- **Hb levels**: > 18.5 g/dl in men and > 16.5 g/dl in women or a red cell mass that is > 25% above the mean normal predicted.
- **Increased Hb levels**: Hb level > 17 g/dl in men (> 15 g/dl in women) associated with a sustained increase of ⩾2 g/dl from baseline that cannot be attributed to the correction of iron deficiency.

It has been argued that the application of these criteria may result in an underdiagnosis of PV by excluding patients whose actual red cell mass is 25% above the mean predicted value but whose Hb and Hct levels are below the WHO guidelines. Recently, the term masked PV (mPV) was re-introduced for JAK2-mutated patients with latent (initial, occult pre-polycythemic) disease manifestations. These patients present with bone marrow (BM) morphology consistent with PV and display persistently raised Hb levels between 16.0 and 18.5 g/dl for men and 15.0 and 16.5 g/dl for women.

Subsequently, a Hb level of 16.5 g/dl in men and 16.0 g/dl for women, or in accordance with the BCSH criteria, a Hct level of 49% in men and 48% in women, was determined to be the optimal cutoff levels for distinguishing JAK2-mutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) from mPV. These data were entered in the new proposal for the WHO and accordingly shown in Table 1. The clinical relevance of recognizing mPV was demonstrated in a recent study.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Images from the Haematologica atlas of hematologic cytology: Parvovirus-induced pure red cell aplasia [^113iLuTB]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare disorder characterized by normochromic-normocytic or normochromic-macrocytic anemia, marked reticulocytopenia, and an almost complete absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. In most cases, the granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages are normal. This disorder includes both congenital and acquired conditions. In older children and adults, the most common form of acute PRCA is due to parvovirus B19 infection. The virus invades and destroys red cell progenitors, and the aplasia is terminated when neutralizing antibodies develop. In immunocompromised patients, parvovirus B19 infection can cause a chronic form of PRCA.

Distinguishing morphological features of parvovirus-induced PRCA are illustrated in the figure showing bone marrow smears from a heart transplant recipient presenting with severe normochromic normocytic anemia, a low reticulocyte count, and normal leukocyte, differential, and platelet counts, as well as high levels of erythropoietin.

- **Panel A and B**: There is marked hypoplasia of the erythroblastic lineage with an almost total absence of maturing erythroblasts. Note the atypical hyperbasophilic giant cells with very large, prominent nucleoli, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and blebs. These giant cells are proerythroblasts with morphological features pathognomonic for parvovirus B19 infection.

- **Panel C**: Shows an enormous proerythroblast with numerous nuclear inclusions.

- **Panel D**: The atypical erythroblasts show an abnormal, very strongly positive periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction.

The diagnosis of parvovirus B19-induced PRCA was confirmed by immunocytochemistry.

### New sporadic case of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III in an aged woman: Detailed description of ultrastructural findings [^113b9yLa]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a new case of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type III. This least common type of CDA was diagnosed at the age of 59 in a 70-year-old woman who suffered from a young age from mild macrocytic anemia, while the long follow-up since diagnosis documented a benign clinical course. No family history of blood diseases was obtained, and no anemia was documented in the medical records of any of her four children. The bone marrow (BM) examination on light microscopy revealed a severe erythroid hyperplasia with the presence of giant multinucleated erythroblasts.

- **Ultrastructural examination**: The BM disclosed the presence of many large multinucleated erythroblasts bearing a variety of ultrastructural findings: nuclear clefts, autophagic vacuoles, iron-loaded mitochondria, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. In addition, extensive hyperlobulation of the nucleus and partial loss of the nuclear membrane with "spilling" of nuclear material into the adjacent cytoplasm was also noted in some erythroblasts. These last two findings have not been previously described in CDA III.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Identifying appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, as well as determining when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, remain significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded in elderly patients due to their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type ii in a teenager presenting with severe anaemia [^113NWigz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA) type II is a rare disease characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis and mononuclear cytopenia. Patients generally present with extravascular haemolytic anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. A female patient in her mid-teens presented with severe anaemia and abdominal distention. Her medical history was significant for a diagnosis of β-thalassaemia intermedia made in her infancy. However, subsequent investigations showed normal reticulocyte counts that were disproportionate to the severity of her anaemia and a negative β-thalassemia mutation analysis, raising concerns about a specific lineage disorder. A bone marrow trephine showed features typical of CDA type II: erythroid hyperplasia with multiple binucleate erythrocytes.

CDA type II has often been mistaken for other congenital or acquired forms of anaemia. This case report intends to raise awareness among clinicians to consider CDA type II as a rare but possible cause of severe anaemia in a teenager with a previous presumptive diagnosis of β-thalassaemia.

### Clonal haematopoiesis associates with distinct cytometric changes of red blood cells and platelets [^11271YXK]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Individuals with macrocytosis or a high RDW are at increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. The mechanisms that mediate this association remain unknown but may involve the presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH). Here, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing on all individuals aged 60 years or more with macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL; n = 269) or high RDW (RDW ≥ 16%; n = 242) and 1:2 age- and sex-matched controls from the population-based Lifelines cohort.

Macrocytosis is not associated with CH or peripheral blood count abnormalities. In contrast, individuals with a high RDW were associated with an increased number of mutated genes, larger clone sizes, and a high prevalence of blood count abnormalities. Interestingly, individuals with a high RDW and CH display a uniform population of red blood cells in the distribution plots, despite not all cells carrying the respective mutation, suggesting an indirect effect of CH on the red blood cell population.

While macrocytosis is not associated with CH in general, SF3B1 mutations are associated with an elevated MCV. Individuals with a combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations show marked disturbances in platelet morphology. In conclusion, cytometric parameters of peripheral blood cells may serve as early indicators of dysplastic changes and are associated with distinct mutational patterns in CH.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with neurological dysfunction in an adolescent [^112SJeP9]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is classically encountered in the adult Caucasian population and manifests as a subacute combined degeneration in the presence or absence of macrocytic anemia. However, B12 deficiency is extremely rare in children in developed countries, and pernicious anemia is an even rarer etiology of this deficiency. The clinical presentation of B12 deficiency in children is not as easily recognizable or well-characterized, which may result in missed or delayed diagnosis.

- **Patient description**: We describe a previously healthy adolescent girl who presented with emotional lability, mental status changes, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. She was found to have megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration secondary to B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia.

- **Conclusion**: Although B12 deficiency is uncommon in pediatrics, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion because early recognition and treatment of B12 deficiency are key to preventing long-term neurological sequelae.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009).

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

Anemia is a common sign with numerous causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluating and managing anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin levels and potentially reduce anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary, as anemia in older age often has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112ZPDVr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, anaemia of CKD is normochromic and normocytic and is morphologically indistinguishable from the anaemia of chronic illness. Initial assessment of anaemia in CKD patients should aim at identifying other factors that may influence the response to treatment.

In addition to Hb, other indices of the FBC report may provide important clinical information. Macrocytosis could be due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition to anaemia of CKD, microcytosis could be due to iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathies. Macrocytosis with leucopoenia or thrombocytopenia could be due to several factors such as alcohol intake, nutritional deficit (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), or myelodysplasia. Serum folate is more prone to variation and can be affected by the patient's diet immediately prior to blood being taken, alcohol, trauma and other factors. Therefore, occasionally red cell folate may need to be measured where serum folate is equivocal. Haemolysis is suggested by the presence of macrocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase, and a positive Coombs test. The normal absolute reticulocyte count ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 cells/μL. Although it has significant inter-patient variability, this test may be useful as a semi-quantitative marker of erythropoietic activity.

- **Evaluating iron status in anaemic patients with CKD**:
	- The aim of evaluating iron status is to assess iron level in tissue stores and the adequacy of iron utilisation for erythropoiesis. Serum ferritin level is the only available blood marker of storage iron. There are several tests to assess the adequacy of iron utilisation.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^114mGNFY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old white man with a known myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with worsening leucocytosis and thrombocytosis in the setting of a presumed infection. The patient had been diagnosed 2 years earlier with an MPN/MDS overlap syndrome, based on characteristic mutations in JAK2, IDH1, and SRSF2. During his evaluation, he was noted to have new microcytosis, with a mean corpuscular volume of approximately 70 fL, down from his baseline of approximately 90 fL. His laboratory workup showed normal iron studies, normal haemoglobin electrophoresis, and no evidence of haemoglobin H or mutations in his ATRX coding region. Without any identifiable cause of his new microcytosis, he was given a presumptive diagnosis of acquired thalassemia in the setting of his unusual MPN/MDS overlap syndrome.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^111mviMJ]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy.

At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### Hereditary myopathies associated with hematological abnormalities [^1132eM56]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected hereditary muscle disease can be challenging. Clinicians rely largely on clinical history and examination features, with additional serological, electrodiagnostic, radiologic, histopathologic, and genetic investigations assisting in definitive diagnosis. Hematological testing is inexpensive and widely available but frequently overlooked in the hereditary myopathy evaluation.

Hematological abnormalities are infrequently encountered in this setting; however, their presence provides a valuable clue, helps refine the differential diagnosis, tailors further investigation, and assists in the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance. A diverse spectrum of hematological abnormalities is associated with hereditary myopathies, including anemias, leukocyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia.

ReRhabdomyolysis in certain glycolytic enzymopathies co-occurs with hemolytic anemia, often chronic and mild in phosphofructokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase deficiencies, or acute and fever-associated in aldolase-A and triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Sideroblastic anemia, commonly severe, accompanies congenital-to-childhood onset mitochondrial myopathies including Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome and mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia phenotypes.

Congenital megaloblastic macrocytic anemia and mitochondrial dysfunction characterize SFXN4-related myopathy. Neutropenia, chronic or cyclical, with recurrent infections, infantile-to-childhood onset skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy are typical in such cases.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^111BVPGL]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

All 150 eligible patients completed three sets of blood tests prior to study analysis (Figure 1). The mean MCV (mean corpuscular volume) for all patients was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl (range 66–120 fl). MCVs for each of the three measurements were 99.0 ± 6.4 fl, 99.1 ± 6.3 fl, and 99.2 ± 6.4 fl with an intrapatient variation of 1 ± 0.7 fl. The MCV was normally distributed. Specifically, 92 patients (61%) had an MCV > 97 fl; 59 patients (39%) had an MCV > 100 fl; 45 patients (30%) had an MCV > 102 fl, and 24 patients (16%) had an MCV > 105 fl. TSH, serum B12, and RBC folate levels were available at baseline in 22 (49%), 21 (47%), and 28 (62%) patients with an MCV > 102 fl, respectively. In those patients with available data, serum B12 and RBC folate levels were normal. Three patients had biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism, indicated by elevated TSH and low free T4 levels. Reticulocyte counts were only available in a few patients.

### An unusual case of extreme thrombocytosis caused by iron deficiency [^116Dsjse]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis, resulting in usually mild to moderately increased platelet counts, but sometimes even leading to extreme thrombocytosis (i.e. > 1000×10^9/L). We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who developed an increased platelet count of 1953×10^9/L. Upon admission, cytoreductive therapy was initiated until an underlying chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia was ruled out. The patient had undergone bariatric surgery 5 years previously, and surprisingly, a diagnosis of reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency secondary to iron malabsorption was made. It is concluded that the degree of extreme thrombocytosis may be even fourfold to fivefold increased in patients with severe iron deficiency. Our finding emphasizes the importance of regularly monitoring the potential need for iron supplementation following bariatric surgery.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: Current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by hemoglobin/hematocrit (Hgb/Hct) levels above 16.5 g/dl/49% for Caucasian males and 16 g/dl/48% for Caucasian females. These findings should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. It is crucial to distinguish true erythrocytosis, which results from either a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), such as polycythemia vera (PV), or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis, from apparent erythrocytosis.

Additionally, it is important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis. This condition features an increase in red cell mass (RCM) accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume, thus being masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in cases of normal Hgb/Hct with concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Apparent erythrocytosis may also occur due to a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values exceeding the 95th percentile of sex-, race-, and altitude-adjusted normal values.

RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution. However, in a study evaluating its performance and practical utility in 105 patients with erythrocytosis, elevated RCM was observed in 76% with PV, 20% with secondary erythrocytosis, 21% with apparent erythrocytosis, and 57% with essential thrombocythemia. In this study, RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels.

### Extreme thrombocytosis as a sign of coeliac disease in the elderly: Case report [^114wE5hQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The increase in the number of blood platelets to over 1,000,000/mm³ in elderly patients is generally considered secondary to a myeloproliferative or neoplastic disease. This case report discusses an elderly woman hospitalized for extreme thrombocytosis associated with severe anemia, who was found to be suffering from coeliac disease.

The patient, aged 83 years, was hospitalized presenting with fatigue. Laboratory tests showed microcytic hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin 4 g/dl) and extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count 1,400,000/mm³). Physical examination was normal, with the exception of marked thinness. There was no evidence of macroscopic bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. She had never suffered from gastrointestinal problems and had no family history of gastroenterological diseases.

Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and histology of the gastric and duodenal mucosa evidenced atrophic gastritis and an adenomatous polyp. The duodenal mucosa showed total villous atrophy, suggesting the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Antiendomysial IgA and anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies were also positive. Colonoscopy was negative. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen was normal, and the spleen was within the normal range. A peripheral blood smear showed no alterations in erythrocyte morphology typical of hyposplenism due to coeliac disease.

The platelet count decreased rapidly after blood transfusions, when both serum iron and ferritin levels were still below normal limits. Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation was observed between the platelet count and hemoglobin.

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem often discovered through routine laboratory tests. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians.

The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary. The evaluation begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include the red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear. Further testing is guided by the results of these studies. Treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying cause of the anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into three subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that, in turn, cause a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors, with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation.

Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency is now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload.

Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are significant.

### Red cell macrocytosis in COPD patients without respiratory insufficiency: a brief report [^1143kREG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Red cell macrocytosis has been frequently described in hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, macrocytosis is not related to hypoxemia. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of macrocytosis, defined as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) higher than 94 fl, in stable COPD patients without respiratory insufficiency and to analyze the possible relationship between its presence and clinical and functional parameters.

Fifty-eight consecutive patients with COPD, and without other significant comorbid conditions, were included in the study. Macrocytosis was present in 17 of the 58 stable COPD patients (29%). The differences between patients with and without macrocytosis were not statistically significant, except for MCV. In the subgroup of 36 ex-smoker COPD patients, macrocytosis was present in nine patients (25%). In this subgroup, MCV significantly correlated with dyspnea (r = 0.36, P = 0.03) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) (r = -0.35, P = 0.03).

We conclude that macrocytosis is a frequent finding in stable non-hypoxemic COPD patients and that, in ex-smoker patients, the degree of macrocytosis is associated with a worse clinical situation in terms of dyspnea and FEV(1).

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS, as well as in CDAs, is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10^9/L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. A peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells, and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia. Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio of 2:1, rather than the norm.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. An increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may sometimes be artifactual. This can occur in cases such as marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are typically larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults) and can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis. This size difference raises the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non-mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are:

- **Impaired DNA synthesis**: Occurs in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis, causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes due to nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony.

- **Altered red cell hydration**: Increases cell volume.

- **Altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane**.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions or malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome.

### Hemolytic anemia: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction.

Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies.

Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of hemolytic anemia.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^116vjNHY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition characterized by a lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from the large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression and may thus become a comorbidity. Due to the requirement of several different types of chemical agents for test procedures, a large volume of blood might be removed for each set of testing, typically around 50–60 mL. Local and reference laboratories often request larger samples than necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. From my experience, a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Folic acid [^115RPuGb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Folic acid doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia by allowing hematologic remission while neurologic manifestations progress. Administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia can delay the diagnosis of pernicious anemia, potentially leading to severe nervous system damage. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve these neurologic changes.

- **Drug interactions**: Evidence suggests that folic acid can antagonize the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin. Patients whose epilepsy is controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent convulsions if folic acid is administered. Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis, and/or interference with metabolism (e.g. folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption, particularly in cases of alcoholic cirrhosis; and the administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin. False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics, such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of Lactobacillus casei.

### Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease [^115QLxxB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case highlights the rare occurrence of sideroblastic anaemia (SA) and sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in a patient. This case underscores the importance of generating a broad differential diagnosis and the ramifications of anchoring bias, which can lead to delayed diagnosis. While this patient's presentation of anaemia with an increased need for red cell transfusion was initially thought to be due to sickle cell disease (SCD), further workup revealed a much less common diagnosis of SA. SA is rare in the general population, and when coupled with anchoring bias related to a well-known cause of anaemia, such as SCD, it can lead to a delay in diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of avoiding premature closure when managing common diseases and calls on the clinician to ask, "What else could it be?"

- **Learning points**: Due to its low prevalence, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemias (SA) is often difficult. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and a low threshold for workup of anaemia often aid in the diagnosis of SA. Loss of response to a previously effective long-term treatment of anaemia should raise suspicion of an additional cause of anaemia. A full workup, including a peripheral smear, complete blood count with differential, iron studies, ferritin, and reticulocyte count, is warranted when SA is suspected. A bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, and genetic testing should be done if congenital SA is suspected. Workup to identify the cause of SA includes ruling out secondary and acquired causes, genetic testing in the appropriate population, and identifying myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasms-related conditions.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations for additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed. The overall aim is to aid the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia.

Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss, and the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered.

If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Evaluation of macrocytic anemias [^115Bz1Pw]. Seminars in Hematology (2015). High credibility.

Macrocytic anemia can arise from a variety of causes including alcohol use disorder, hemolytic anemia, hypersplenism, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and hereditary folate malabsorption. Additionally, certain medications may induce macrocytic anemia; these include trimethoprim, triamterene, thioguanine, pyrimethamine, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, hydroxyurea, fluorouracil, cycloserine, capecitabine, and azathioprine.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: A prospective study [^114SzkiY]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis occurs in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients; however, its significance is unknown. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, identify its clinical associations, and determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 150 stable, adult CHD patients followed for nine months. Macrocytosis was defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) > 97 fl. We analyzed MCV as a continuous variable, in tertiles, and using a cutoff point of 102 fl.

- **Results**: The mean MCV was 99.1 ± 6.4 fl (range 66–120 fl). MCV was normally distributed. Ninety-two (61%) patients had an MCV > 97 fl, and 45 (30%) had an MCV > 102 fl. Patients were not B12 or folate deficient in those with available data, and three patients with an MCV > 102 fl had hypothyroidism. In a logistic regression analysis, an MCV > 102 fl was associated with a higher Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index (CACI) and higher ratios of darbepoetin alfa to hemoglobin (Hb), [(weekly darbepoetin alfa dose in micrograms per kg body weight/Hb in g/L)×1000]. There were 23 deaths at nine months in this study. Unadjusted MCV > 102 fl was associated with mortality (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.42–7.39, P = 0.005). Adjusting for the CACI, an MCV > 102 fl was still associated with mortality (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07–5.71, P = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients. Future studies will need to be conducted to confirm this finding.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays are pivotal in diagnosing congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I. A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, characterized by a haemoglobin (Hb) level ranging from 66 to 116 g/l, with a mean of 92 g/l, and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) between 100 and 120. Despite this, 30% of cases demonstrate a normal MCV. While reports indicate transient neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, generally these lineages remain unaffected.

The hallmark of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I (CDA-I) is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, signifying ineffective erythropoiesis. This was initially identified through ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of the radioactive isotope 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is assessed two weeks post-intravenous infusion. In effective erythropoiesis, such as in cases of anaemia caused by bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of cells containing 59 Fe is approximately 75–80%. However, in ineffective erythropoiesis, this fraction could be as low as 25–30%.

Recently, the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) was developed as a clinical indicator to differentiate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. Defined as [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)], this index was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of CDA-II. Although promising, its utility in CDA-I is yet to be formally validated.

The blood film, as shown in Fig. 2, is notably abnormal, displaying anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrop cells, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, and irregular forms.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consultation in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (e.g. antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review. The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Runner's anemia [^116LFo2K]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

Macrocytic anemia occurring in patients with fatigue suggests numerous diagnoses, ranging from nutritional deficiencies to a myelodysplastic syndrome. A careful history-taking is critically important for recognition of runner's anemia, which is due to plasma volume expansion, with hemolysis from the pounding of feet on pavement, and hemoglobinuria. Gastrointestinal blood loss may also contribute to anemia in long-distance runners. Early recognition of runner's anemia in patients with a complex presentation of anemia is important in circumventing many diagnostic tests. Runner's anemia should be considered when, amidst a constellation of signs and symptoms, mild anemia is well tolerated by an avid runner.

### Active smoking and macrocytosis in the general population: Two population-based cohort studies [^11185Ssu]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes, is a highly prevalent phenomenon in adult individuals. MCV is the measurement of the average volume of red blood cells, and macrocytosis is defined as an MCV exceeding 100 fL. Currently, textbooks and guidelines mention myriad causes for macrocytosis, with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, alcohol use, myeloid dysplastic syndromes, and liver disease as the most prominent ones. In the 1970s, a number of papers reported a positive association between smoking and MCV. This has not resulted in the inclusion of cigarette smoking as an important cause of macrocytosis in textbooks and guidelines. Hence, in the study, we aimed to investigate the association between smoking, assessed by both questionnaire and 24-hour urinary cotinine excretion as an objective measurement of nicotine exposure, with MCV in two large population-based cohorts.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^114hL7Ur]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Genetic disorders causing altered red blood cell (RBC) hydration and hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA) with macrocytosis include PIEZO1- or KCNN4-associated hereditary xerocytosis (HX), and RHAG-associated overhydrated stomatocytosis (OHSt). Increased reticulocyte count and characteristic osmotic gradient ektacytometry (OGE) curves point toward these diagnostic possibilities.

OGE is a diagnostic assay measuring the deformability of RBCs as they are subjected to constant shear stress in a medium of increasing osmolality in a laser diffraction viscometer, allowing for differential diagnosis between the various RBC membrane disorders. Macrocytic stomatocytes and macrothrombocytopenia associated with increased phytosterol content in the membrane lipid bilayer are seen in the autosomal-recessive disorder of sitosterolemia. Increased cholesterol and phospholipids in the RBC membrane contribute to the macrocytic anemia associated with chronic alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. Other causes of macrocytic anemia, not completely understood in their pathophysiology, include hypothyroidism and trisomy 21.

- **Case presentation**: In June 2021, a 32-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of asthenia and jaundice, without choluria, recent infections, or medications. Laboratory tests identified mild regenerative macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 105 fL [normal range (NR): 79–99 fL]; reticulocytes count, 204,000/µL [NR: 15,000–80,000/µL]) associated with a hemolysis pattern (total and indirect bilirubin 6.4 and 6.1 mg/dL, respectively [NR: 0.30–1.20 and 0.10–0.30 mg/dL, respectively], LDH 674 U/L [NR: 208–378 U/L], undetectable haptoglobin), thrombocytosis (platelets 814,000/µL), along with iron overload (ferritin 176 ng/mL [NR: 10–120 ng/mL]), and hypergammaglobulinemia (1.9 g/dL) [NR: 0.8–1.4 g/dL]. Chronic liver disease, monoclonal gammopathy, hereditary spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, and autoimmune origin were excluded. An abdominal ultrasound did not show hepatosplenomegaly.

A peripheral blood smear showed anisocytosis, polychromasia, and thrombocytosis with anisothrombia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) levels were within reference limits.

Throughout recent years (2017–2019), compensated hemolysis was evidenced by normal hemoglobin levels but elevated bilirubin and LDH. Due to recurrent hepatic colic, she underwent cholecystectomy in 2018. Notably, the onset of anemia coincided with the appearance of thrombocytosis in June 2019. Her pediatric history indicated she was born after two first-trimester miscarriages and was the oldest of three siblings.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^112HYMu9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has advanced due to the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme synthesis. Numerous case reports illustrate that implementing these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has enhanced our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. By integrating these insights into daily clinical practice, there can be a reduction in delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments.

To assist clinicians, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias caused by genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, making these guidelines relevant for pediatricians and clinicians treating adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, recommendations, and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate their use in the clinical setting.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113AAYBz]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

Patients may present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper, which may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment, including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged over 60 years are at the highest risk for developing pernicious anemia, characterized by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells. A B12 level of less than 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrant a diagnostic trial of B12.

Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories, and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency and normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

### Folate [^111ZMBNu]. Advances in Nutrition (2013). High credibility.

Folate deficiency can be associated with a range of health issues, including memory impairment, mouth ulcers, anemia, decreased hemoglobin, and findings related to celiac disease. Other symptoms and conditions include pancytopenia, decreased reticulocyte count, macrocytic anemia, and complications during pregnancy. Additionally, folate deficiency may lead to depression, fatigue, a sore and red tongue, increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), visual disorders, and reactions to certain medications. Behavioral and lifestyle factors such as confusion, alcohol consumption, and paresthesia are also linked. Nutritional factors include a lack of folic acid in the diet, which can result in muscle weakness, increased serum homocysteine, decreased serum folate, and increased serum methylmalonic acid (MMA).

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115fQhob]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia

The anemia of autoimmune gastritis (AIG) with or without pernicious anemia (PA) may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic is the classic association (Figure 3). Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, with the most common etiologies being iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. Gastric acid is important for enzyme activation and freeing micronutrients from dietary sources. It is also crucial for the reduction and absorption of iron.

As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG may be attributed to parietal cell loss, as well as autoantibodies targeting intrinsic factor (IF). IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores are depleted more quickly than vitamin B12 stores, and thus iron deficiency anemia is often an early manifestation of AIG. While the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompts an AIG workup, it should be equally appreciated that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated in patients.

The diagnosis of anemia may also be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. To this end, one multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, demonstrated that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia. PA was more common in males and older patients, whereas iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in both those with and without anemia. These findings were similar to another cohort study.

### Aplastic anaemia [^113kg9kP]. Lancet (2005). High credibility.

Aplastic anemia is a disease that can present with a variety of symptoms including fatigue, gum bleeding, pallor, dyspnea, and nosebleeds. Other clinical features include decreased blood neutrophil count, decreased platelet count, fever, decreased blood monocytes, and petechiae. Patients may also experience easy bruising, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding tendency, macrocytosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. Associated conditions can include Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, pancytopenia, and dyskeratosis congenita. Further manifestations include decreased reticulocyte count, anisopoikilocytosis, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, anemia, exercise intolerance, and vitreous hemorrhage.
