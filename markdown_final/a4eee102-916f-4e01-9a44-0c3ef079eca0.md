## Question

What is cauda equina

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the cauda equina is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core anatomical definition to ground the discussion. Then, I should define the clinical syndrome and its key features. Next, I will review etiologies and pathophysiology, followed by the diagnostic approach including objective bladder assessment and imaging. After that, I need to consider classification schemes and their reliability, special populations and mimics, and finally management urgency, outcomes, prognosis, and medico-legal/resource considerations, ensuring I verify each point against the cited literature before concluding a synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical foundation: the cauda equina is the bundle of lumbosacral nerve roots descending from the conus medullaris (usually at L1–L2) through the lumbar and sacral canal to exit via their foramina and innervate lower limbs, pelvic organs, and perineum; this neuroanatomy underpins the characteristic sensorimotor and autonomic deficits seen when these roots are compressed or inflamed.

> Now, I should define the clinical entity precisely: cauda equina syndrome is a clinical‑radiological diagnosis characterized by varying combinations of low back pain, unilateral or bilateral sciatica, lower‑extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel/bladder/sexual dysfunction, and it is a neurosurgical emergency due to risk of irreversible deficits; while some authors emphasize bladder involvement to definitively label CES, others frame CES as a spectrum where autonomic features may be incomplete at presentation, so I need to be careful not to overstate a single criterion as mandatory [^114Aqjpv] [^115H2hrd] [^1141n7qW].

> Wait, let me verify the cardinal features and their diagnostic weight: the "full‑blown" presentation often includes urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, bilateral leg pain/numbness/weakness, and decreased rectal tone, yet most patients do not present with all signs initially and exam findings alone lack adequate sensitivity, so high suspicion with prompt imaging is critical; bilateral sciatica and saddle anesthesia increase likelihood, but absence does not reliably exclude CES [^112PtcP9] [^113hLy4w] [^112xJ5ci].

> I will now examine etiologies, ensuring I include common and important alternatives: the most frequent cause is a large central lumbar disc herniation; other causes include trauma, postoperative/iatrogenic injury or epidural hematoma, tumors (primary/metastatic), infections (e.g., epidural abscess), inflammatory conditions (neurosarcoidosis), HSV‑related lumbosacral radiculomyelitis known as Elsberg syndrome, degenerative stenosis, vascular lesions like dural AV fistula, and rare congenital lesions; remembering these differentials helps avoid anchoring on herniation alone [^112PtcP9] [^113hLy4w] [^115LR8j4] [^113dcwmR] [^115CyLjW] [^112ctz72].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology and double‑check the pressure‑time concept: root injury arises from mechanical compression, venous congestion, ischemia, and inflammatory/chemical irritation; experimental data suggest a sigmoidal deterioration in neurophysiology when compressive pressures approach/exceed arterial pressure for sustained periods, with prognosis relating more to degree of compression and residual function than an arbitrary time threshold alone, which may partly explain heterogeneous outcomes in clinical cohorts [^111S4Bbf] [^1148Rj5e] [^112PtcP9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis based only on symptoms; I need to ensure an objective, stepwise approach: start with careful history and neurologic exam, including perineal sensation and anal tone, but incorporate bladder objective measures such as post‑void residual (PVR) via ultrasound, where a threshold of ≥ 200 mL has high sensitivity (~94%) and excellent NPV (~99%) for significant compression and can risk‑stratify urgency while awaiting MRI; then proceed to urgent MRI of the lumbosacral spine as the imaging modality of choice, or CT myelography if MRI is contraindicated [^111axjFt] [^113hLy4w].

> Let me think about imaging efficiency because resource constraints matter: standard MRI remains the reference for confirming canal compromise and alternative pathologies, but limited sequence (LS) lumbosacral MRI protocols have shown promise for rapid screening in patients under 55, reporting 100% sensitivity in one series, though broader validation is needed before changing pathways; this could reduce bottlenecks without missing compressive lesions if carefully implemented [^112PtcP9] [^112KNHtJ].

> But wait, what if the MRI is negative despite convincing symptoms? I should review the "scan‑negative CES" literature: the majority of suspected CES presentations may have no radiographic cauda equina compression, with higher rates of functional neurological disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and chronic pain in scan‑negative groups, underscoring the need to avoid unnecessary surgery while ensuring safety; prospective data similarly show distinct clinical profiles and alternative neurologic diagnoses emerging on follow‑up in a minority [^117RzdSK] [^116eJt2u] [^114rtzhm] [^113dMzon].

> I need to ensure the classification I use is clinically meaningful; however, I should double‑check reliability: subcategorizing into incomplete CES (CES‑I) versus CES with retention (CES‑R) can aid communication and urgency cues, and "impending" CES is sometimes used where compression is present without full criteria, but inter‑observer reliability for these categories is poor even among experienced surgeons, implying we must rely on integrated clinical, bladder scan, and imaging findings rather than rigid labels alone [^1141n7qW] [^115b76Lp] [^115cMc9g] [^11539WuG].

> Next, I should review special settings and mimics so I don't miss atypical contexts: during pregnancy and labor, bowel/bladder symptoms can be nonspecific, so a high index of suspicion and MRI are warranted; long‑standing ankylosing spondylitis may rarely cause CES without herniation, potentially via dural ectasia; neoplastic infiltration can present as CES; HSV‑related Elsberg syndrome and neurosarcoidosis can mimic or cause CES through radiculitis and leptomeningitis with characteristic imaging and CSF findings and often require antivirals or immunosuppression rather than decompression [^1133AeXw] [^1177h8Ro] [^111XqDwd] [^111vA6mN] [^111s1YGL] [^115uUhsN].

> Let me first confirm the management cornerstone: once compressive CES is suspected with supporting MRI, urgent surgical decompression is standard of care; evidence suggests better bladder outcomes when decompression occurs within 48 hours on average, though some cohorts show no clear differences across < 24, < 48, and < 72 hour thresholds, likely reflecting the dominance of pre‑decompression neurologic status and compression severity; nonetheless, delays beyond 48 hours are associated with worse discharge disposition and are generally avoided [^112PtcP9] [^114WEt8z] [^113ifkig] [^1126oAzF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought early surgery always normalizes outcomes; I should verify long‑term data: despite timely decompression, many patients have persistent deficits — meta‑analysis shows long‑term rates roughly 43% for bladder dysfunction, 31% bowel dysfunction, 53% sensory loss, 38% motor weakness, and 40% sexual dysfunction; additional prospective work notes poor return‑to‑work and that bilateral motor deficit and anal incontinence at presentation portend worse recovery, reinforcing the importance of preoperative neurologic severity in prognosis [^114WEt8z] [^11222VSF].

> I need to check adjuncts that refine decision‑making and minimize false positives: multichannel urodynamics can objectively confirm neurovesical involvement and reduce unnecessary surgery in equivocal cases with positive MRI but unclear bladder findings, with protocols safely observing select patients lacking urodynamic evidence of neurogenic bladder, provided close monitoring and readiness to operate on deterioration [^114xZRjV].

> Next, I should review system‑level and epidemiologic context to set expectations: CES is uncommon, with a UK incidence of approximately 0.4 per 100,000 person‑years, yet it drives a disproportionate demand for urgent MRI — tertiary centers report a 10‑fold rise in scans to exclude compression and operative rates around 5%, which align with prior literature; these data highlight the need for efficient pathways and rapid reporting to meet time targets [^116aJT7F] [^116QUooR].

> I should confirm the medico‑legal implications and documentation priorities because they influence clinical behavior: CES carries high medicolegal risk, with litigation common, and documentation of bladder, bowel, and sexual function is often incomplete; thorough, time‑stamped recording of neurologic and autonomic status, PVR measurements, imaging timing, and counseling is essential to optimize care and mitigate legal risk [^114Aqjpv] [^115H2hrd].

> Finally, synthesizing all this, I should ensure the take‑home is clinically actionable: cauda equina describes the lumbosacral nerve roots whose compression produces CES, a time‑critical emergency detected by combining high clinical suspicion, objective bladder assessment (PVR), and emergent MRI; urgent decompression generally improves the chances of recovery, especially bladder outcomes when not delayed beyond 48 hours on average, but residual deficits are common and driven largely by preoperative severity and compression physiology; awareness of scan‑negative presentations, inflammatory/infectious mimics, and the limits of subcategorization improves diagnostic precision and resource stewardship while maintaining patient safety [^111axjFt] [^112KNHtJ] [^114WEt8z] [^115cMc9g] [^113dMzon].

The cauda equina is the **bundle of lumbar and sacral nerve roots** below the conus medullaris; these roots innervate the lower limbs, pelvic organs, and perineum. Compression of these roots causes cauda equina syndrome — a surgical emergency [^113hLy4w] characterized by **saddle anesthesia, bladder/bowel dysfunction, and lower limb weakness** [^112PtcP9]. The most common cause is a large central lumbar disc herniation; other causes include tumors, trauma, infection, and stenosis [^111vA6mN] [^115LR8j4] [^113hLy4w]. MRI is the diagnostic gold standard [^112KNHtJ] [^116QUooR], and urgent decompression within 24–48 hours is critical to prevent permanent neurological deficits [^114WEt8z] [^1126oAzF] [^113ifkig].

---

## Anatomical structure and function

The cauda equina **begins at the conus medullaris (L1–L2)** and extends to the coccyx, comprising the lumbar (L2–L5), sacral (S1–S5), and coccygeal nerve roots; these roots provide motor and sensory innervation to the lower limbs, pelvic organs, and perineum.

---

## Clinical significance: cauda equina syndrome (CES)

CES is a **neurological emergency** [^113hLy4w] resulting from compression of the cauda equina nerve roots and can cause severe morbidity if not treated promptly [^114Aqjpv].

---

### Clinical presentation

CES presents with a characteristic constellation of symptoms and signs [^112PtcP9] [^113hLy4w]:

- **Saddle anesthesia**: Loss of sensation in the perineal and inner thigh regions.
- **Bladder dysfunction**: Urinary retention or incontinence.
- **Bowel dysfunction**: Fecal incontinence or constipation.
- **Lower limb weakness**: Motor weakness, sensory loss, and reduced reflexes.
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Impotence or loss of sexual sensation.

---

### Causes of CES

The most common causes of CES are [^114Aqjpv]:

- **Lumbar disc herniation**: Most frequent cause, particularly large central herniations [^115wCsDt].
- **Spinal tumors**: Primary or metastatic neoplasms compressing nerve roots [^111vA6mN].
- **Trauma**: Fractures or dislocations of the lumbar spine [^114d1bA9].
- **Spinal stenosis**: Narrowing of the spinal canal [^114Aqjpv].
- **Infections**: Epidural abscesses or other spinal infections [^115LR8j4].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Prompt diagnosis of CES is **critical** to prevent permanent neurological damage [^113hLy4w] [^112xJ5ci]. Diagnostic methods include:

- **Clinical assessment**: Thorough history and physical examination to identify characteristic symptoms and signs [^113hLy4w].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Gold standard imaging modality to confirm nerve root compression [^112KNHtJ] [^116QUooR].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Alternative imaging method if MRI is unavailable [^114Aqjpv].
- **Bladder scanning**: Measurement of post-void residual volume to assess bladder dysfunction [^111axjFt].

---

## Treatment and management

CES requires **urgent surgical decompression** of the compressed nerve roots, ideally within 24–48 hours of symptom onset, to prevent permanent neurological deficits [^114WEt8z] [^1126oAzF] [^113ifkig]. Postoperative care includes physical therapy, bladder training, and pain management, with multidisciplinary involvement of neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, urologists, and rehabilitation specialists to optimize recovery.

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of CES depends on the severity of neurological deficits at presentation and the timing of surgical intervention. Early surgery within **24–48 hours** significantly improves outcomes, particularly bladder function [^114WEt8z] [^113ifkig]. Delayed treatment can result in permanent neurological deficits, including chronic pain, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and lower limb weakness [^112PtcP9].

---

## Epidemiology

CES is a **rare condition**, with an incidence of approximately 0.4 per 100,000 person-years in the United Kingdom [^116aJT7F]. It is more common in adults, particularly those with lumbar disc herniation or degenerative spinal conditions.

---

## Conclusion

The cauda equina is a bundle of lumbar and sacral nerve roots below the conus medullaris that supplies motor and sensory innervation to the lower limbs, pelvic organs, and perineum. Compression of these nerve roots results in cauda equina syndrome, a **neurological emergency** requiring urgent surgical intervention. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to **prevent permanent neurological damage** and optimize patient outcomes [^114Aqjpv].

## References

### Cauda equina syndrome [^112PtcP9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition typically associated with a large, space-occupying lesion within the canal of the lumbosacral spine. The syndrome is characterized by varying patterns of low back pain, sciatica, lower extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The pathophysiology remains unclear but may be related to damage to the nerve roots composing the cauda equina from direct mechanical compression, venous congestion, or ischemia. Early diagnosis is often challenging because the initial signs and symptoms frequently are subtle.

Classically, the full-blown syndrome includes urinary retention, saddle anesthesia of the perineum, bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Decreased rectal tone may be a relatively late finding. Early signs and symptoms of a developing postoperative cauda equina syndrome are often attributed to common postoperative findings. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary in the postoperative spine patient with back and/or leg pain refractory to analgesia, especially in the setting of urinary retention.

Regardless of the setting, when cauda equina syndrome is diagnosed, the treatment is urgent surgical decompression of the spinal canal.

### Outcomes of cauda equina syndrome due to lumbar disc herniation after surgical management and the factors affecting it: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies with 852 cases [^114WEt8z]. European Spine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes after surgical decompression in cauda equina syndrome (CES) and to determine if any preoperative patient-related factors contributed to these outcomes.

A systematic literature search was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Ovid. Data regarding outcome parameters from eligible studies were extracted. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

A total of 852 patients (492 males and 360 females), with a mean age of 44.6 ± 5.5 years from 22 studies diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome and undergoing surgical decompression, were included in the meta-analysis; however, not all studies reported every outcome. The mean follow-up period was 39.2 months, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months in all included studies. Meta-analysis showed that on long-term follow-up, 43.3% [29.1, 57.5] (n = 708) of patients had persistent bladder dysfunction. Persistent bowel dysfunction was observed in 31.1% [14.7, 47.6] (n = 439) of cases, sensory deficit in 53.3% [37.1, 69.6] (n = 519), motor weakness in 38.4% [22.4, 54.4] (n = 490), and sexual dysfunction in 40.1% [28.0, 52.1] (n = 411). Decompression within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms was associated with a favorable outcome in terms of bladder function, with 24.6% [1.6, 50.9] (n = 75) of patients having persistent dysfunction, whereas 50.3% [10.3, 90.4] (n = 185) of patients in studies with a mean time to decompression after 48 hours had persistent bladder dysfunction. Other factors, such as speed of onset and sex of the patients, were not specified.

### Evaluation and management of cauda equina syndrome [^114Aqjpv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome is a potentially devastating spinal condition. The diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome lacks sensitivity and specificity, sometimes occurring after irreparable neurological damage has happened. Timely diagnosis and treatment are imperative for optimal outcomes and for avoiding medicolegal ramifications. Cauda equina syndrome results from conditions that compress the nerves in the lumbosacral spinal canal. Although no consensus definition exists, it generally presents with varying degrees of sensory loss, motor weakness, and bowel and bladder dysfunction (the latter of which is required to definitively establish the diagnosis). A thorough history and physical exam is imperative, followed by magnetic resonance imaging or a computed tomography myelogram to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Once suspected, an emergent spinal surgery referral is indicated, along with urgent decompression. Even with expeditious surgery, improvements remain inconsistent. However, early intervention has been shown to portend a greater chance of neurologic recovery. All providers in clinical practice must understand the severity of this condition. Providers can optimize long-term patient outcomes and minimize the risk of litigation by ensuring open communication, good clinical practice, thorough documentation, and expeditious care.

### Cauda equina syndrome caused by primary and metastatic neoplasms [^111vA6mN]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is defined as a constellation of symptoms that includes low-back pain, sciatica, saddle anesthesia, decreased rectal tone and perineal reflexes, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and variable amounts of lower-extremity weakness. There are several causes of this syndrome, including trauma, central disc protrusion, hemorrhage, and neoplastic invasion. In this manuscript, the authors reviewed CES in the setting of both primary and secondary neoplasms. They examined the various primary tumor types in this region as well as those representative of metastatic spread. Both surgical and nonsurgical management in this setting were studied.

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: Clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^112rbz4K]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Specifics regarding clinical presentation are outlined in Table 2. Chronic presentations exceeding 28 days were most common, occurring in 78.6% of cases (11/14). Symptoms were typically asymmetric, also seen in 78.6% of cases (11/14). The most common presenting symptoms included lower extremity numbness (85.7%, 12/14), weakness (64.3%, 9/14), perineal numbness (35.7%, 5/14), pain (42.3%, 6/14), incontinence (28.6%, 4/14), and erectile dysfunction (7.1%, 1/14).

True cauda equina syndrome, as opposed to incidental radiographic involvement, was present in 92.9% of patients (13/14). This syndrome was the predominant neurosarcoidosis phenotype necessitating patient presentation in 57.1% of cases (8/14). It was also a codominant phenotype in four other cases, where patients had additional conditions such as optic neuritis (1), myelitis (2), and multiple cranial neuropathies (1). In one instance, myelitis was the primary symptom generator, while in another, cauda equina involvement was considered incidental to hydrocephalus. The median nadir mRS score was 3, with a range of 2 to 4.

### Is cauda equina syndrome being treated within the recommended time frame [^1126oAzF]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but devastating medical condition requiring urgent surgery to halt or reverse neurological compromise. Controversy exists as to how soon surgery must be performed after diagnosis, and clinical and medicolegal factors make this question highly relevant to the spine surgeon. It is unclear from the literature how often CES patients are treated within the recommended time frame.

- **Objective**: To determine whether CES patients are being treated in compliance with the guideline of surgery within 48 hours and to assess incidence, demography, comorbidities, and outcome measures of CES patients.

- **Methods**: We searched the 2003 to 2006 California State Inpatient Databases to identify degenerative lumbar disk disorder patients surgically treated for CES. An International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, clinical modification, diagnosis code was used to identify CES patients with advanced disease.

- **Results**: The majority (88.74%) of California's CES patients received surgery within the recommended 48-hour window after diagnosis. The incidence of CES in surgically treated degenerative lumbar disk patients was 1.51%, with an average of 397 cases per year in California. CES patients had worse outcomes and used more healthcare resources than other surgically treated degenerative lumbar disk patients; this disparity was more pronounced for patients with advanced CES. CES patients treated after 48 hours had three times the odds of a nonroutine discharge as patients treated within 48 hours (odds ratio = 3.082; P < .001).

### Elsberg syndrome: A rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^112RNLWy]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The onset of Elsberg syndrome (ES) was consistently acute in our cohort; an insidious onset and evolution suggest alternative explanations such as sarcoidosis or neoplasm. Suspected cauda equina involvement, leading to urinary retention, is confirmed with MRI and/or EMG. Concomitant myelitis detected radiologically or clinically further supports the diagnosis. Myelitis, associated with many inflammatory CNS conditions such as MS, NMO, anti-MOG antibody myelitis, sarcoidosis, and others, is not usually associated with radiculitis, whereas radiculitis is a required feature for the diagnosis of ES.

We did not identify pathognomonic or specific neuroradiologic findings. Nevertheless, some characteristics were typical and could help distinguish ES from other disorders.

- **Spinal cord lesions**: These were commonly multiple and discontinuous, usually not expansile, and centrally or ventrally positioned in the cord. Unlike the typical imaging pattern of dural arteriovenous fistula, which can also cause both upper and lower motor neuron problems, the cord lesions in ES are not consistently located in the most caudal portion of the conus.

- **Dural arteriovenous fistula lesions**: In distinction, they are usually continuous, extending rostral from the lowermost portion of the conus, involve most of the thickness of the cord, and are commonly associated with swelling.

- **Nerve root enhancement**: This was sometimes diffuse and sometimes limited to ventral or dorsal roots. It was always smooth and continuous, and never nodular or plaque-like as can be seen with neoplastic nerve root lesions.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^114rtzhm]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders are not uncommon in the population; however, levels of 40 or 50% are higher than expected even in patients with chronic neurological disease. This is higher than psychiatric comorbidity observed in some studies of patients with chronic back pain. Patients with avoidance and panic are more likely to develop chronic pain, so knowledge and appropriate treatment of these comorbidities are important.

Urological symptoms requiring urology input were similar in both groups. This is noteworthy given that urological symptoms are one of the most common reasons why patients with 'scan-positive' CES must be urgently operated on. A high number of patients in the 'scan-negative' groups presented with clinical CES that required an urgent scan, which was always negative. This suggests that not only are patients exhibiting symptoms correlating with clinical CES, as per the Fraser et al. criteria, but that they are also high-resource users. We should make more effort to understand and treat them.

### Presentation of cauda equina syndrome during labour [^1133AeXw]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are rare in pregnancy, with an incidence of 1:10,000. Less than 2% of these herniations result in cauda equina syndrome (CES). Diagnosing CES in pregnant patients can be difficult because changes in bladder and bowel habits are common in normal pregnancies.

We present the case of a 29-year-old woman with a history of lumbar radiculopathy, who presented at 39 weeks gestation with severe lower back and bilateral lower limb radiculopathy. Symptoms of CES began to develop only after the onset of labour. A diagnostic MRI was obtained following delivery, and the patient was treated by microdiscectomy. Following surgery, bladder and bowel function began to normalize, and at 3 months follow-up, she had made a full recovery.

To the best of our knowledge, CES has never been reported to present during labour. This case highlights the diagnostic dilemma and need for a high index of suspicion.

### Elsberg syndrome: A rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^115CyLjW]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Elsberg syndrome (ES) is a presumed infectious syndrome consisting of acute or subacute bilateral lumbosacral radiculitis, often accompanied by myelitis confined to the lower spinal cord. It is frequently a manifestation of reactivation, or occasionally, primary herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) infection. Clinicians often do not consider ES in the differential diagnosis of acute cauda equina syndrome (CES) and do not perform appropriate testing for HSV infection in a timely way to facilitate definitive diagnosis. However, especially when accompanied by clinical or radiologic findings of myelitis, ES is not a rare cause of CES.

ES has been the subject of case reports and small series, the largest of which included 17 patients. A formal case definition that delineates the minimum criteria to diagnose this syndrome and identifies exclusionary findings that suggest alternative diagnoses does not exist. Sarcoidosis, lymphoma, other neoplasms, and vascular disorders (dural arteriovenous fistula) may mimic ES and are in the differential diagnosis.

We conducted a retrospective review of lumbosacral myeloradiculitis evaluated at the Mayo Clinic to assess the frequency of ES, determined retrospectively as well as prospectively. Among cases who did not have other established diagnoses and who met certain minimum criteria, we reviewed Mayo clinical records to classify the level of diagnostic certainty using a scheme we derived based on a review of the medical literature. We identified clinical, demographic, and radiologic findings of ES, concentrating on distinction from other causes.

### Cauda equina syndrome in ankylosing spondylitis: Challenges in diagnosis, management, and pathogenesis [^111XqDwd]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare neurologic complication of longstanding ankylosing spondylitis (AS). It is unclear what causes CES, and no proven or effective therapy has been reported at the time of writing. We have encountered six patients with longstanding AS diagnosed with CES. We set about to study their features, review the literature, and generate hypotheses regarding pathophysiology, as well as speculate on the possibilities of early recognition and prevention.

- **Methods**: We obtained permission from six patients with longstanding AS and CES to access their medical records and imaging studies for research purposes related to this paper. We collected and reviewed each patient's medical history, imaging studies, disease duration, past therapies — especially those that relate to AS — laboratory data, as well as any treatment they received for CES and follow-up results of each case to the present time.

- **Results**: The six cases of CES with AS have remarkable similarity to each other in that several decades of the disease had passed before neurologic symptoms and later signs appeared. All cases have fused spines and facet joints without spinal fractures, spinal stenosis, or disc herniation.

- **Conclusion**: CES is a rare yet debilitating neurologic complication of longstanding AS. The pathophysiology and treatments are far from clear. We postulate that chronic enthesitis of the vertebral column initiates the process that results in dural stiffening and formation of ectasias, causing downstream nerve root damage.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^116eJt2u]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with suspected clinical cauda equina syndrome (CES) have no identifiable structural cause for their symptoms, termed 'scan-negative' CES. Understanding these patients aids in the clinical differentiation and management of CES.

- **Methods**: A retrospective electronic note review was undertaken of patients presenting with suspected CES, defined as experiencing one or more of the following: acute bladder, bowel, sexual dysfunction, or saddle numbness, to a regional neurosciences center. The study investigated radiology, clinical features, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with 'scan-negative' CES and those with MRI-confirmed compression of the cauda equina ('scan-positive' CES).

- **Results**: Two hundred seventy-six patients were seen over 16 months. There were three main radiologically defined patient groups: (1) 'Scan-positive' CES (n = 78, mean age 48 years, 56% female); (2) 'Scan-negative' CES without central canal stenosis but with lumbosacral nerve root compression not explaining the clinical presentation (n = 87, mean age 43 years, 68% female); (3) 'Scan-negative' CES without neural compromise (n = 104, mean age 42 years, 70% female). Among the two 'scan-negative' groups (no neural compromise and nerve root compression), there were higher rates of functional disorders (37% and 29% vs. 9%), functional neurological disorders (12% and 11% vs. 0%), and psychiatric comorbidity (53% and 40% vs. 20%). On follow-up (mean 13–16 months), only one of the 191 patients with 'scan-negative' CES was diagnosed with an explanatory neurological disorder (transverse myelitis).

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: Clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^112ctz72]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease affecting the nervous system in 3%–5% of cases. It can affect almost any component of the nervous system. Involvement of the cauda equina is an understudied phenotype, and questions remain regarding its natural history and optimal approach to management. This study aims to examine the long-term clinical evolution of neurosarcoidosis affecting the cauda equina, as well as the response to treatment, and clinical and radiographic outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients with neurosarcoidosis treated at Emory University between January 1, 2011, and December 8, 2021, were retrospectively evaluated for manifestations of cauda equina disease and included if disease of the cauda equina could be substantiated by MRI or EMG.

- **Results**: Of 216 cases, 14 (6.5%) involved the cauda equina. The median age was 49.5 years, and most were female (85.7%) and African American (64.3%). Chronic presentations lasting more than 28 days were most common (78.6%), but acute (less than 7 days, 14.3%) and subacute (7–28 days, 7.1%) presentations were also observed. The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at nadir was 3 (range 2–4). Symptoms were asymmetric in 78.6% of patients and included leg numbness (85.7%), leg weakness (64.3%), perineal numbness (35.7%), pain (42.3%), and incontinence (21.4%). On MRI, the cauda equina enhanced in 100% of cases, appeared nodular in 78.6%, and was diffusely involved in 71.4%. Coexisting myelitis was common, with cervical involvement seen in 28.6%, thoracic in 35.7%, and conus medullaris in 28.6%. Intracranial inflammation included leptomeningitis (71.4%) and cranial neuropathies (57.1%).

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^117RzdSK]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

We found that of 276 consecutive cauda equina syndrome (CES) patients, 28% (n = 78/276) were 'scan positive', 69% (n = 191/276) were 'scan negative', and 3% (n = 7/276) had an alternative cause mimicking or causing sacral nerve dysfunction. There was no single clinical feature that differentiated between the groups. Among the scan-negative patients, nearly half had a nerve root compression that may have contributed to but did not explain their clinical presentation.

These patients with 'scan-negative' CES were more likely to have comorbid psychiatric and functional disorders and to experience chronic pain on follow-up. The data support a model in which 'scan-negative' cauda equina arises as an end pathway of acute pain, sometimes with partly structural causes, medication side effects, and vulnerability to functional disorder. A prospective study with systematically collected clinical data, additional imaging, and neurological assessment would reduce these limitations.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: A systematic literature review [^115wm3TN]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

At present, there is no COS for CES, which is to the detriment of patients and health services. The aim of this systematic literature review is to inform the future development of a COS by identifying all documented outcomes for patients after surgery in CES, determining if they are defined, and assessing what variability exists. This systematic literature review represents the first step in developing a COS for patients who have undergone surgery for CES, to be utilized in both research and practice.

### Compressive pressure versus time in cauda equina syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies [^111S4Bbf]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that electrophysiological dysfunction in acute cauda equina compression occurs in a sigmoidal pattern, with significant deterioration when mean arterial blood pressure is exceeded and sustained for approximately 1 hour. Accounting for pressure and duration may help risk-stratify patients prior to decompression.

Outcomes after decompression appeared to be related more to the degree of compression, where exceeding systolic blood pressure tended to result in an irreversible lesion, rather than the duration of compression. Prognosis was most strongly associated with residual pre-decompression function. We suggest the presence of two broad phenotypic groups within cauda equina syndrome, defined by the degree of ischemia, as a potential explanatory pathophysiological mechanism.

### Delays in the treatment of cauda equina syndrome due to its variable clinical features in patients presenting to the emergency department [^112xJ5ci]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

To identify reasons for delay in the management of patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) and to determine commonly presented features of CES, a retrospective review was conducted. The presenting features and management of patients treated for CES over a 4-year period were analyzed. Reasons for delay in treatment were identified in over half of the patients.

Most patients do not present with all the characteristic features of CES. Sacral sensory loss is a sensitive and relatively specific sign for diagnosing CES.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^116mijx2]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The retrospective nature of the study and its dependence on electronic notes resulted in missing data. The design means that data about clinical features were not collected through routine practice systematically. This may explain our potentially controversial findings of bilateral sciatica being more common in patients with 'scan-positive' CES, although we think this is unlikely, especially given the high rate of symptom documentation (95%).

Patients with 'scan-positive' CES, including those with 'impending' CES, were more likely to have normal bladder function than patients with 'scan-negative' CES, which was an unexpected finding of our study. The high frequency of missing data about sexual function was surprising and may be important in differentiating 'scan-positive' from 'scan-negative' CES.

Not all patients with normal radiology saw a neurologist, for example, if they were discharged quickly. This may mean that functional comorbidity was underestimated. All patients with 'scan-positive' CES from South East Scotland were included, whereas only 'scan-negative' CES patients from a smaller area (NHS Lothian) with complete medical records were included. Hence, this study cannot be used to estimate CES incidence or compare incidence of 'scan-positive' vs. 'scan-negative' CES. However, this limitation means that scan-negative CES is likely to be even more common than we have demonstrated in this study.

Medication records were not accurate enough for inclusion in the study, representing a gap in the data. Primary care data about outcomes on follow-up were also not consistently captured.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^115H2hrd]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical features of cauda equina syndrome were evaluated based on various parameters. Urinary function was documented in 98% (n = 263) of cases, lower limb pain in 93% (n = 250), saddle sensation in 92% (n = 247), lower limb power in 85% (n = 229), and sensation in 84% (n = 225) of cases. Conversely, bowel function (66%, n = 177), anal tone from digital rectal examination (56%, n = 151), and sexual function (5%, n = 14) were poorly or very poorly documented.

Symptoms observed in patients with scan-positive CES included a higher likelihood of bilateral sciatica and a surprisingly lower incidence of documented bladder dysfunction compared to patients in either of the scan-negative CES groups. These findings were controversial and prompted further review. Even when both scan-negative groups were combined, bilateral sciatica was significantly more prevalent in patients with scan-positive CES (38% vs. 20%, n = 30/78 vs. n = 39/191, P = 0.002). Patients with normal bladder function met the criteria for 'impending' cauda equina syndrome, with radiological evidence of cauda equina compression and one or more additional clinical signs, most commonly saddle numbness (documented in 20 patients) or bowel or sexual dysfunction (documented in four patients each).

Significantly, patients with scan-positive CES were more likely to experience saddle numbness (64% vs. 54% and 52%, P = 0.04, 0.02); however, rates of this symptom were relatively high (> 50%) across all groups.

Comorbidity was notable, with both patient groups with scan-negative CES exhibiting a higher likelihood of having a comorbid functional disorder, functional neurological disorder, and psychiatric disorders.

### Elsberg syndrome: A rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^1172sWck]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Forty-nine patients satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical and MRI findings are summarized. Interestingly, three patients met criteria for laboratory-supported definite, nine for clinically definite, ten for clinically probable, and eight for clinically possible Elsberg syndrome (ES). Nineteen patients were excluded; sixteen (84%) due to exclusionary criteria, and three (16%) because they failed to satisfy any of the established levels of diagnostic certainty, including two of the four initially diagnosed with ES but lacking sufficient information to confirm the diagnosis. Based on MRI and EMG, available in twenty-nine and twenty-one cases, respectively, two patients had only myelitis, five only radiculitis, and sixteen both. Notably, only two included patients had been diagnosed with ES at the time of their clinical evaluation.

- **Key clinical and radiologic features**: Of the thirty patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-supported, definite, probable, or possible ES, twenty-four (80%) were men, and six were women (20%). Their median age was 53 years. Five patients (17%) experienced prodromal symptoms, including fever, headache, photophobia, diarrhea, myalgia, and general malaise. Sacral herpes infection (zoster, n = 1; simplex, n = 1) immediately preceded clinical presentation in two patients, and oral herpes simplex in one patient. Urinary retention was present in twenty-three (77%) patients, requiring indwelling catheterization in twenty-one (70%) patients. Saddle anesthesia was noted in fifteen (50%) patients, and constipation in thirteen (43%) was documented.

### Elsberg syndrome: A rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^111s1YGL]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Elsberg syndrome (ES) is an established but often unrecognized cause of acute lumbosacral radiculitis with myelitis related to recent herpes virus infection. We defined ES, determined its frequency in patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) with myelitis, and evaluated its clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic features and outcomes.

- **Methods**: We searched the Mayo Clinic medical records for ES and subsequently for combinations of index terms to identify patients with suspected CES and myelitis.

- **Results**: Our search yielded 30 patients, 2 diagnosed with ES and an additional 28 with clinical or radiologic evidence of CES, retrospectively suspected of having ES. We classified patients into 5 groups according to diagnostic certainty. MRI and EMG confirmed that 2 had only myelitis, 5 only radiculitis, and 16 both. Two had preceding sacral herpes infection and 1 oral herpes simplex. Spinal cord lesions were commonly multiple, discontinuous, not expansile, and centrally or ventrally positioned. Lesions generally spared the distal conus. Nerve root enhancement was occasionally prominent and was smooth rather than nodular. Lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis was common. Thirteen patients (43%) had viral isolation studies, which were commonly delayed; the delay may have accounted for the low rate of viral detection. Acyclovir was administered to 6 patients. Most patients recovered with sequelae; 1 patient experienced encephalomyelitis and died.

ES is a definable condition likely responsible for 10% of patients with combined CES and myelitis. Radiologic findings are critical in the diagnosis and management of ES.

### Compressive pressure versus time in cauda equina syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies [^113iMvfE]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

We aimed to examine the relationship of both compressive pressure and duration in cauda equina compression, and subsequent decompression, with neurophysiological function and pathophysiology in animal studies using systematic review and meta-analysis. Further, we aimed to investigate any relationship with systemic blood pressure to assess whether a vascular contribution in the underlying mechanism might contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of this disease.

### Does early surgical decompression in cauda equina syndrome improve bladder outcome [^113ifkig]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

We analyzed retrospectively whether early surgery for cauda equina syndrome (CES) within 24, 48, or 72 hours of onset of autonomic symptoms made any difference to bladder function at initial outpatient follow-up.

The study aimed to determine the impact of early surgery on CES, which can potentially cause loss of autonomic control, including bladder dysfunction, resulting in significant disability. There is significant debate regarding the appropriate timing of surgery.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 200 patients between 2000 and 2011 who underwent decompressive surgery for CES at a regional neurosurgical center. Data were collected from clinical admission and initial follow-up. Presentation was categorized into CES with retention (CESR) and incomplete CES (CESI), considering the duration of autonomic symptoms before surgical intervention.

- **Results**: A total of 200 patients had complete clinical records; 61 cases with CESR and 139 cases with CESI. The average initial follow-up time was 96 days. For the 36 cases with CESI of less than 24 hours, normal bladder function was observed at follow-up in all patients except 4 (11.1%). In contrast, among 103 cases with CESI of more than 24 hours, 48 (46.6%) had bladder dysfunction [Pearson χ²P = 0.000]. For the 64 CESI cases of less than 48 hours, normal bladder function was seen at follow-up in all except 10 (15.6%). Conversely, among 75 cases with CESI of more than 48 hours, 42 (56%) had bladder dysfunction [Pearson χ²P = 0.000]. For the 35 patients with CESR, operating within 24, 48, or 72 hours made no obvious difference in the bladder outcome.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^115b76Lp]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The study examined cases of clinical and radiological presentations of cauda equina syndrome (CES). Clinical CES was defined using the Fraser et al. criteria, which include one or more of the following: bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, saddle numbness, or lower limb neurological deficit.

Radiological cauda equina compression was characterized by greater than 75% canal stenosis or absence of cerebrospinal fluid around the cauda equina nerve roots. 'Impending' CES was described as meeting the following conditions: (a) clinical criteria by Fraser et al, (b) an MRI scan showing a compressive lesion sufficiently large to compress cauda equina nerve roots but not meeting the radiological criteria, and (c) the consultant neurosurgeon's opinion that the lesion was causing clinical symptoms and would progress to irreversible CES without urgent treatment.

- **Patient classification**: Patients were categorized as 'scan-positive' CES if they exhibited clinical and radiological evidence of CES or 'impending' CES based on the above definitions. 'Scan-negative' CES was defined for patients who met the Fraser et al. criteria, underwent an urgent MRI scan for possible CES, and had no evidence of radiological cauda equina compression on the MRI.

- **Methods - Recruitment**: In July 2016, a retrospective electronic record review was conducted for consecutive referrals with possible cauda equina syndrome to the regional neurosurgery service in Edinburgh. The period spanned from August 2013 to November 2014, with electronic note follow-up until July 2016. Two authors (IH, SP) manually reviewed consecutive neurosurgical referrals documented as possible cauda equina syndrome. Patients were only included in the study if they met the clinical criteria.

### Limited sequence MRI to improve standards of care for suspected cauda equina syndrome [^112KNHtJ]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). High credibility.

Early cases of cauda equina syndrome (CES) often present with nonspecific symptoms and signs, and it is recommended that patients undergo emergency MRI regardless of the time since presentation. This creates substantial pressure on resources, with many scans performed to rule out cauda equina rather than confirm it. We propose that compression of the cauda equina should be apparent with a limited sequence (LS) scan that takes significantly less time to perform.

- **Methods**: In all, 188 patients with suspected CES underwent a LS lumbosacral MRI between the beginning of September 2017 and the end of July 2018. These images were read by a consultant musculoskeletal radiologist. All images took place on a 3T or 1.5T MRI scanner at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, UK, and Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK.

- **Results**: The 188 patients, all under the age of 55 years, underwent 196 LS lumbosacral MRI scans for suspected CES. Of these patients, 14 had cauda equina compression and underwent emergency decompression. No cases of CES were missed. Patients spent a mean 9.9 minutes (8 to 10) in the MRI scanner.

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that a LS lumbosacral MRI could be used to diagnose CES safely in patients under the age of 55 years, but further research is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique before changes to existing protocols can be recommended. In addition, work is needed to assess if LS MRIs can be used throughout the spine and if alternative pathology is being considered. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(4):501–505.

### Cauda equina syndrome: Poor recovery prognosis despite early treatment [^11222VSF]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

A prospective patient's database was utilized to assess cauda equina syndrome (CES). The aim of this study was to identify prognosis factors for favorable functional recovery after CES. CES is a neurological impairment with varying symptoms, including urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunctions, with or without motor or sensory deficits, caused by nerve root compression of the cauda equina. The definition of CES, prognosis factors for recovery, and the benefits of early surgery remain debated.

One hundred forty patients were included between January 2010 and 2019. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted. The patients were relatively young, with a median age of 46.8 years (ranging from 18 to 86 years). At presentation, 60% of patients were affected by a motor deficit, 42.8% by a sensory deficit, 70% experienced urinary dysfunctions, and 44% had bowel dysfunctions. The mean follow-up was 15.5 months.

- **Prognosis factors for recovery**: Bilateral motor deficit (P = 0.017) and an initial deficit severity of 0 to 2 (P = 0.001) were identified as prognosis factors for poor motor recovery. Initial anal incontinence (P = 0.007) was associated with poor bowel recovery. Only 32.8% of patients returned to work.
- **Factors for poor return-to-work prognosis**: Initial motor deficit (P = 0.015), motor sequelae (P = 0.001), sphincter dysfunction sequelae (P = 0.02), and extended length of stay (P = 0.02) were poor return-to-work prognosis factors. Time to surgery, whether conducted < 24 hours, < 48 hours, or later, did not serve as a prognostic factor for recovery in CES. The study found no significant difference in recovery between incomplete versus complete CES.

### Compressive pressure versus time in cauda equina syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies [^1148Rj5e]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study selection**: We identified 6,393 unique English-language studies. Sixty-six used animal models of acute cauda equina compression, and 17 of these satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study.

- **Study characteristics**: A total of 422 animals were included in the study, with nine studies using canine models (218 animals) and eight using porcine models (204 animals).

- **Risk of bias**: The median study quality was 3/10, with an interquartile range of 3 to 4.

- **Analysis**:
	- **Histology**: Briefly, short compression (2–120 minutes) at high pressure (50–200 mmHg) resulted in edema, which increased with both higher pressure and longer duration.
	- **Blood flow**: Low-pressure compression (10–15 mmHg) at either 24 minutes or 7 days did not significantly reduce mean blood flow.
	- **Electrophysiology (EP)**:
		- **Global effect size**: Cauda equina compression significantly reduced EP measures, and decompression with 90 minutes of recovery significantly improved EP measures. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies.

### Comparative analysis of patients with cauda equina syndrome versus an unaffected population undergoing spinal surgery [^112PPj7U]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

This study is a retrospective analysis aimed at determining patient demographics, incidence of comorbidities, and procedure-related complications. It also seeks to identify risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality after spinal surgery for cauda equina syndrome (CES).

To our knowledge, no study has provided nationwide estimates of patient characteristics and procedure-related complication rates after spinal surgery for CES in comparison to an unaffected population. Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, collected between 2001 and 2010, were analyzed. Discharges with procedural codes for lumbar spinal fusion, decompression, or discectomy were included. The CES cohort included diagnoses of CES, while the unaffected cohort included diagnoses of lumbar spinal pathology. Patient demographics, incidence of comorbidities and procedure-related complications, and risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality were compared.

Discharges for 11,207 CES and 689,799 unaffected patients were identified. Differences between cohorts were noted in demographic and hospital data. The average comorbidity indices for the CES cohort were increased (0.23 vs. 0.13, P < 0.0001), as well as the incidence of total procedure-related complications (18.63% vs. 13.12%, P < 0.0001). The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher for the CES cohort (0.30% vs. 0.08%, P < 0.0001). A number of comorbidities associated with additional risk for morbidity and mortality among the CES cohort were identified.

### Infectious origins of cauda equina syndrome [^115LR8j4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Infections in the spine can lead to a wide range of problems for both the patient and physician. There is perhaps no more devastating complication than the neurological consequences of cauda equina syndrome due to spinal infection. A variety of organisms and origins can make diagnosis and treatment of spinal infection a difficult task. Both pyogenic and nonpyogenic organisms can cause vertebral involvement and can result in an epidural abscess with neurological compromise. Nonetheless, these two types of infections vary greatly in terms of associated patient demographics, clinical course, and treatments. The purpose of this paper was to review these types of infections and summarize treatment recommendations for this difficult condition.

### Scan-negative cauda equina syndrome: A prospective cohort study [^113dMzon]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To describe clinical features relevant to diagnosis, mechanism, and etiology in patients with "scan-negative" cauda equina syndrome (CES), we carried out a prospective study of consecutive patients presenting with the clinical features of CES to a regional neurosurgery center. The study comprised a semi-structured interview and questionnaires investigating presenting symptoms, neurological examination, psychiatric and functional disorder comorbidity, bladder/bowel/sexual function, distress, and disability.

A total of 198 patients presented consecutively over 28 months. Forty-seven were diagnosed with scan-positive CES (mean age 48 years, 43% female). Seventy-six mixed category patients had nerve root compression/displacement without CES compression (mean age 46 years, 71% female), and 61 patients had scan-negative CES (mean age 40 years, 77% female). An alternative neurologic cause of CES emerged in 14 out of 198 patients during admission and 4 out of 151 patients with a mean duration of 25 months follow-up.

Patients with scan-negative CES had more positive clinical signs of a functional neurologic disorder (11% scan-positive CES vs. 34% mixed and 68% scan-negative, p < 0.0001), were more likely to describe their back pain as worst ever (41% vs. 46% and 70%, p = 0.005), and were more likely to have symptoms of a panic attack at onset (37% vs. 57% and 70%, p = 0.001). Patients with scan-positive CES were more likely to have reduced/absent bilateral ankle jerks (78% vs. 30% and 12%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between groups in the frequency of reduc…

### Cauda equina thickening: An approach to MRI findings [^114oqZxf]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

There are many causes of cauda equina (CE) thickening on neuroimaging of the lumbar spine. The imaging features of CE thickening for the various conditions often overlap and are not specific enough to clinch a definite diagnosis. Hence, the imaging findings have to be discerned in accordance with the patient's presenting history, clinical examination findings, and results from electrophysiology and laboratory studies. In this review, the authors aim to supplement the existing literature on imaging findings of CE thickening with a diagnostic framework for clinical workup. The authors also aim to familiarize readers with the interpretation of CE thickening on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and illustrate the normal variants and pitfalls that could be mistaken for abnormal results.

### Cauda equina syndrome in patients with low lumbar fractures [^114d1bA9]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES) can include low-back pain, sciatica, lower-extremity weakness, sensory deficit, perineal hypesthesia or anesthesia, and loss of bowel or bladder function. Several causes of the syndrome are recognized, but its optimal treatment remains controversial and has been broadly based on data gathered from series involving herniated discs. Information on the treatment of CES caused by low lumbar traumatic injuries has not been well documented.

- **Methods**: Between January 2000 and December 2003, 17 consecutive cases of CES caused by low lumbar traumatic injuries at L2–5 were identified. The traumatic injuries consisted of gunshot wounds in two cases, motor vehicle accidents in 11, and a fall from height in four. Conus medullaris injuries causing CES were excluded from this review. Presenting symptoms, mechanisms of injury, radiographic images, timing of surgery, surgical approaches, and neurological status at the final follow-up were documented. All patients underwent follow-up of at least 12 months. Fourteen of the 17 patients had satisfactory outcomes. Despite undergoing surgery within the first 24 hours post-injury, three patients had what was classified as a poor outcome given their residual deficits and included two cases with gunshot injuries. Recovery of leg weakness occurred within 4 months, whereas bladder and bowel function recovered within 3 months. All patients in this series underwent decompression within less than 48 hours after syndrome onset. Overall, the authors found no difference regarding the timing of surgery between patients.

### Cauda equina syndrome presenting as abdominal pain: A case report [^112feqKj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is an uncommon entity. Symptoms include bowel and bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, and varying degrees of lower limb motor and sensory disturbances. The consequences of delayed diagnosis can be devastating, resulting in bowel and bladder incontinence and lower limb paralysis. There is little in literature regarding abdominal pain as a significant feature of the initial presentation of CES. We present the case of a 32-year-old woman with CES who presented to the emergency department with gradually worsening lower abdominal pain.

### No turning back: A long-term retrospective analysis of urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed for suspected cauda equina compression in a tertiary referral centre [^116QUooR]. Clinical Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but potentially serious condition for which diagnosis is time-critical for the best outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice, but the diagnostic pathway is challenging as the availability of 24/7 urgent MRI is mostly limited to tertiary centres. We present a 13-year experience at one such tertiary centre.

- **Materials and methods**: All lumbar spine MRIs performed for suspected cauda equina between 2011 and 2023 were identified retrospectively from trust-wide information technology (IT) systems. Data, including time from request to scan acquisition and reporting times, were analyzed using automated methods with manual validation.

- **Results**: At our institution, there has been a 10-fold increase in demand for MRI to exclude cauda equina compression over the last decade. In recent years, the mean duration from request to MRI acquisition was within the 4-hour national target in approximately 90% of cases, and the time from MRI acquisition to the first verified report met the 1-hour national target in just over half of cases (51.1% in 2023). In 2023, 90.0% of reports were verified within 4 hours and 77.5% within 2 hours, satisfying locally defined standards. Since 2012, 377 patients with clinical suspicion of cauda equina syndrome and positive MRI proceeded to spinal surgery within a week. The mean 5.1% operative rate between 2012 and 2023 corresponds well to previous literature.

- **Conclusion**: There is a rising demand for urgent MRI to exclude cauda equina compression, with consequent logistical and financial considerations.

### Impact of MR neurography in patients with chronic cauda equina syndrome presenting as chronic pelvic pain and dysfunction [^116GV65Y]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic cauda equina syndrome, defined as persistent damage of the cauda equina nerve roots within the spinal canal, can be a challenging diagnosis with varied presentations. MR neurography imaging is increasingly used to evaluate the lumbosacral spine of patients suspected of having subacute or chronic cauda equina syndrome. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of lumbosacral plexus MR neurography in the diagnostic thinking and therapeutic management of patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain and dysfunction and suspected chronic cauda equina syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: Consecutive MR neurography lumbosacral plexus examinations at our institution were reviewed retrospectively. Relevant data collected included the following: patient demographics, clinical history, pertinent physical examination findings, preimaging diagnostic impression, prior MR imaging lumbar spine findings, MR neurography findings, postimaging diagnosis, and postimaging treatment plan. The impact of imaging on the preimaging clinical diagnosis and therapeutic management was evaluated.

- **Results**: Of 185 studies of patients who presented with chronic pelvic pain and/or dysfunction, 23 with clinically suspected chronic cauda equina syndrome and imaging findings were included in the study (2 subjects were lost to follow-up). The mean ages were 53 ± 12 years and 53 ± 16 years for men and women, respectively. The common etiologies included arachnoiditis (n = 8), tethered cord (n = 2), and simple/Tarlov cysts (n = 3). Eighteen of 23 (78%) subjects had a change in diagnosis.

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: Clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^116WQ8bV]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of presumed autoimmune etiology thought to occur in genetically susceptible individuals in response to unidentified environmental antigens. The lymphatic system, lungs, eyes, and skin are most commonly affected, but approximately 3–5% of patients develop clinically evident neurologic disease, often within the first two years of developing systemic sarcoidosis. Neurologic manifestations are the presenting symptoms in roughly half of patients with neurosarcoidosis with multiorgan disease, and the most common clinicoradiographic phenotypes are cranial neuropathies, leptomeningitis, and parenchymal disease of the brain and spinal cord.

Injury to the cauda equina often presents with bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction, as well as altered sensation in the saddle region. Depending on the extent of lumbosacral nerve root involvement, patients may also experience sensorimotor deficits in the lower extremities. A structural explanation is almost always present, such as disc herniation and vertebral fracture among others, but less commonly, nonstructural etiologies are found, including vascular, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. Neurosarcoidosis has only rarely been described as a potential cause of cauda equina syndrome, most often in single case reports or small series.

In this retrospective cohort analysis, we review the clinical features, diagnostic testing results, treatment strategies, and long-term outcomes of 14 patients with neurosarcoidosis involving the cauda equina. We attempt to clarify the following points: (1) the frequency with which neurosarcoidosis is a contributing factor to cauda equina syndrome.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: A systematic literature review [^111k6L34]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Below are the definitions for the main terms used in the analysis of this systematic literature review.

- **Core outcome domain**: The overall category under which similar subdomains and outcomes are grouped. The outcome domains used in this article are linked to the high-level set of outcome categories used in the annotation of Cochrane reviews and discussed with the COMET initiative team.

- **Subdomain**: A subcategory of a core outcome domain under which similar outcomes are grouped.

- **Outcome**: An outcome documented in an article following a patient has undergone an operation for cauda equina syndrome (CES). For example, nervous system (core outcome domain) > bladder function (subdomain) > urinary incontinence (outcome).

- **Variations**: The different terms used to define a core outcome domain or subdomain.

- **Outcome definition**: This was categorized as "no definition" or "definition present". If a definition was present, it could be subjectively complete or partial but recorded as "definition present". "No definition" indicates the outcome domain was mentioned without an accompanying definition in the article or assessment tool.

### The failure of subcategorization of cauda equina syndrome [^11539WuG]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnostic sub-categorization of cauda equina syndrome (CES) is used to aid communication between doctors and other healthcare professionals. It also determines the need for, and urgency of, MRI and surgery in these patients. A recent paper by Hoeritzauer et al. (2023) in this journal examined the interobserver reliability of the widely accepted subcategories in 100 patients with cauda equina syndrome. They found that there is no useful interobserver agreement for the subcategories, even among experienced spinal surgeons. This observation is supported by the largest prospective study of the treatment of cauda equina syndrome in the UK by Woodfield et al. (2023).

If the accepted subcategories are unreliable, they cannot be used in their current form and should be revised or abandoned. This paper presents a reassessment of the diagnostic and prognostic subcategories of cauda equina syndrome in light of this evidence, with a suggested revision based on a more inclusive synthesis of symptoms, signs, bladder ultrasound scan results, and pre-intervention urinary catheterization.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: A systematic literature review [^111oTMYU]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

There is significant heterogeneity in outcomes reported for studies after surgery for CES patients and the methods by which they are measured. This indicates a clear need for the development of a core outcome set (COS). The results of this systematic literature review will be combined with those sourced from CES patients through qualitative interviews. All outcomes will then be prioritized through a Delphi process and consensus meeting to develop a core list of outcomes deemed most important by key stakeholders.

### The clinical features and outcome of scan-negative and scan-positive cases in suspected cauda equina syndrome: a retrospective study of 276 patients [^1156SJ8G]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

With respect to the initial admission, all patients had urgent MRI lumbosacral scans, which included the cauda equina down to the S5 foramina of the sacrum. A local protocol dictates that a T2 sagittal of the cervical and thoracic spine should be done if the MRI lumbosacral spine is normal. All scans were reported by a consultant neuroradiologist.

Using a standardized proforma, we assessed the radiological features, demographics, clinical symptoms and signs, completeness of clinical documentation, and the timing of the operation. Urgent operations are classified as those occurring during the initial admission, while elective operations are classified as those scheduled after discharge due to symptoms and radiology findings from admission.

Follow-up was carried out using electronic records until July 2016 by examining scan requests, accident and emergency attendances, and all secondary care inpatient and outpatient visits. Information was obtained on several factors:

- **Functional disorder comorbidity**: fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and non-cardiac chest pain.
- **Functional neurological disorders**: as defined in DSM 5, including functional motor disorders and non-epileptic seizures.
- **Psychiatric comorbidity**: anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidal ideation or deliberate overdose, anorexia nervosa.
- **Other symptoms**: presence of chronic pain documented in letters, urological symptoms, re-presentations with clinically suspected CES.
- **New diagnoses**: explanations for suspected CES presentations in patients with 'scan-negative' CES.

### Racial and health insurance differences in patient outcomes after surgical treatment for cauda equina syndrome: A United States retrospective hospital claims database analysis [^116J3N5P]. Spine (2023). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is an uncommon yet devastating neurological condition that requires urgent surgical decompression. CES is caused by compression of the lumbar nerve roots, and clinical presentations may include a combination of bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, back and leg pain, and lower limb weakness. Timely evaluation, diagnosis, and advanced imaging, typically with magnetic resonance imaging, and urgent operative intervention are recommended within 24 to 48 hours at the latest to prevent permanent neurological deficits. For physicians, CES has been associated with significant medico-legal and financial consequences, with reports of damages paid in approximately half of all CES cases.

Racial disparities in the care of patients and outcomes following health system utilization have been well documented. The Institute of Medicine highlighted these health care disparities in the report "Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care". The report concluded that even after controlling for insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions, racial and ethnic disparities in health care exist.

In orthopedics and spine surgery, health care disparities related to race in the treatment of degenerative and non-degenerative spinal conditions have been reported. These studies demonstrate that for many of these nonemergent spinal conditions, disparities in health care outcomes exist among race groups, particularly for Black/African-American patients compared with White/Caucasian patients.

### Evaluation and management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department [^113hLy4w]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) may be a devastating disease with the potential for significant patient morbidity. It is essential for emergency clinicians to be aware of how to effectively diagnose and manage this condition.

This article provides a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of CES for the emergency clinician. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but emergent condition associated with back pain. It can result in severe morbidity and can be due to a variety of causes, most commonly vertebral disc protrusion. Diagnosis is often delayed, which may result in a poor prognosis. Red flags and findings consistent with CES include bilateral neurogenic sciatica, reduced perineal sensation, altered bladder function leading to painless urinary retention, loss of anal tone, and loss of sexual function. In isolation, history and examination findings demonstrate poor sensitivity. Symptoms may occur either suddenly or gradually, and most patients do not present with all of these symptoms. Postvoid bladder volume assessments can assist in the evaluation, but the diagnosis typically involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography myelography if MRI is not available. Treatment relies upon surgical consultation and operative intervention for decompression.

Cauda equina syndrome can be a difficult diagnosis. However, knowledge of the history and examination findings, imaging, and treatment can assist the emergency clinician in optimizing the management of this condition.

### Cauda equina syndrome [^115cMc9g]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) require emergency imaging and surgical decompression. The severity and type of symptoms may influence the timing of imaging and surgery and help predict the patient's prognosis. Categories of CES attempt to group patients for management and prognostication purposes. We aimed in this study to assess the inter-rater reliability of dividing patients with CES into categories to assess whether they can be reliably applied in clinical practice and research.

- **Methods**: A literature review was undertaken to identify published descriptions of categories of CES. A total of 100 real anonymized clinical vignettes of patients diagnosed with CES from the Understanding Cauda Equina Syndrome (UCES) study were reviewed by consultant spinal surgeons, neurosurgical registrars, and medical students. All were provided with published category definitions and asked to decide whether each patient had 'suspected CES', 'early CES', 'incomplete CES', or 'CES with urinary retention'. Inter-rater agreement was assessed for all categories, for all raters, and for each group of raters using Fleiss's kappa.

- **Results**: Each of the 100 participants were rated by four medical students, five neurosurgical registrars, and four consultant spinal surgeons. No groups achieved reasonable inter-rater agreement for any of the categories. CES with retention versus all other categories had the highest inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.34; 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.31), indicating minimal agreement. There was no improvement in inter-rater agreement with clinical experience.

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: Clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^115uUhsN]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

In this single-center retrospective analysis, we review the presenting clinical features, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, serum and CSF abnormalities, treatments, and outcomes of 14 patients with neurosarcoidosis phenotypically expressed as disease of the cauda equina. Major findings include cauda equina involvement being:

- **An uncommon occurrence**: As a clinicoradiographic phenotype of neurosarcoidosis.
- **More common in those of female sex**.
	- **Primary driver of clinical presentations**: As opposed to an incidental radiographic abnormality.
- **Responsiveness to methotrexate**: Either alone or in combination with infliximab.
- **Potentially poor prognostic factor**: For future recovery.

Our results showed a striking female predominance (6 females: 1 male, 85.7% female) for this particular form of neurosarcoidosis, almost equivalent to that seen in aquaporin-4–positive neuromyelitis optica. This contrasts starkly with recent cohorts of general neurosarcoidosis, where females constitute 52%–63% of cases. Males usually comprise a greater share of patients with neurosarcoidosis with myelitis (53%–60%), but female predominance in neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina was evident despite myelitis being a coexisting component of the disease spectrum in 42.9% of our cases.

In our cohort, all patients had spinal leptomeningitis, and a majority also had intracranial leptomeningitis (71.4%). Widespread leptomeningeal disease is a common finding in neurosarcoidosis and often one of the more suggestive features for diagnosis when present.

### Management of cauda equina syndrome during pregnancy and postpartum [^1177h8Ro]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare condition that results from multiple nerve root compressions. It is considered a surgical emergency because it can lead to permanent neurological damage. There is limited literature regarding the management and prognosis of CES for pregnant patients, leaving providers with many questions when encountering patients with this condition. We describe the case of a patient who developed CES during pregnancy. She presented at 30 weeks gestation and successfully underwent surgical decompression in the prone position. She later delivered via elective caesarean at term. This case highlights management considerations for pregnant patients with CES, including positioning during surgery and the use of regional anaesthesia.

### Cauda equina syndrome: A review of the current clinical and medico-legal position [^115wCsDt]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare condition with a disproportionately high medico-legal profile. It occurs most frequently following a large central lumbar disc herniation, prolapse, or sequestration. Review of the literature indicates that around 50–70% of patients present with urinary retention (CES-R), while 30–50% have an incomplete syndrome (CES-I). The latter group, especially if the history is less than a few days, usually requires emergency MRI to confirm the diagnosis, followed by prompt decompression by a suitably experienced surgeon.

Every effort should be made to avoid CES-I, with its more favorable prognosis, becoming CES-R while under medical supervision, either before or after admission to the hospital. The degree of urgency of early surgery in CES-R is still not in clear focus, but it cannot be doubted that the earliest decompression removes the mechanical and perhaps chemical factors, which are the causes of progressive neurological damage. A full explanation and consent procedure prior to surgery is essential in order to reduce the likelihood of misunderstanding and litigation in the event of a persistent neurological deficit.

### Cauda equina syndrome: False-positive diagnosis of neurogenic bladder can be reduced by multichannel urodynamic study [^114xZRjV]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The present consensus suggests urgent surgical decompression if clinical features of cauda equina syndrome (CES) are supported by MRI evidence of pressure on the cauda equina. However, clinical diagnosis has a high false-positive rate and MRI is a poor indicator. Though urodynamic studies (UDS) provide objective information about the lower urinary tract symptoms experienced by patients, including neurogenic bladder, its role in the diagnosis of CES is not established.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the ability of an objective urological assessment protocol using uroflowmetry and USG-PVR as a screening test and invasive UDS as a confirmatory test in patients with suspected CES to rule out neurological impairment of bladder function.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on all patients referred to our institution with equivocal findings of cauda equina syndrome from January 2014 to December 2018 with positive MRI findings. An algorithm using multichannel UDS was followed in all included patients.

- **Results**: Out of 249 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 34 patients (13.65%) had normal uroflowmetry and USG-PVR findings; 211 patients underwent invasive UDS. Only 141 (57.6%) out of 245 patients had neurovesical involvement due to compression of the cauda equina, while 67 patients were treated conservatively using the objective protocol. Only one patient treated conservatively had to undergo emergency decompression for deterioration in symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Multichannel UDS provides an objective diagnostic tool to definitively establish neurovesical involvement in patients suspected of having CES.

### Elsberg syndrome: A rarely recognized cause of cauda equina syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis [^1146GwhN]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Interrogation of the electronic database for specific key terms highlighted in the first box returned a list of 1,035 patients. We excluded patients with an ICD code identifying NMO and MS, yielding 837 patients. Further interrogation of the database for patients with the following key terms returned 337 patients: "urinary retention" OR "paresthesia" OR "neuralgic pain" OR "constipation" OR "impotence" OR "perineal" OR "retention" OR "anus" OR "anal" OR "saddle". After the review of individual clinical records of the remaining patients, we excluded 213 subjects who had likely or established alternative diagnoses, as listed in the figure, and only patients who were confirmed to have urinary retention and other sacral sensory symptoms were retained. Of the remaining 49 patients, 19 did not satisfy any of the levels of diagnostic certainty proposed in table 1. The remaining 30 were assigned a specific diagnostic category according to the level of suspicion for ES (Elsberg syndrome); ICD = International Classification of Disease; NMO = neuromyelitis optica.

We defined diagnostic criteria for ES with five levels of diagnostic certainty based on the review of the medical literature: laboratory-supported definite, clinically definite, clinically probable, clinically possible, and excluded (see table 1). Radiculitis, defined either clinically (table 1, A1) or by MRI and/or electrophysiologic evidence (table 1, A2), was required to establish a diagnosis of ES. A neurologist (B.G.W.) categorized each case according to these criteria.

### Diffuse cauda equina enhancement in a middle aged male with Susac syndrome and symptomatic cauda equina syndrome [^113eFHyf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder first described by Susac et al. in 1979. Clinically, Susac syndrome consists of a triad including encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. All three components of the triad usually do not present at the same time, thus delaying the time to diagnosis. MRI studies often show characteristic punched-out lesions of the central fibers of the corpus callosum. Intracranial leptomeningeal enhancement may be seen; however, cauda equina involvement has not been described to our knowledge.

We present a case of Susac syndrome in a middle-aged male with symptoms of cauda equina syndrome and spinal MRI showing diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina.

### Compressive pressure versus time in cauda equina syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies [^114fzinv]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

The relationship of predictive factors and outcomes after cauda equina syndrome (CES) is complex. This meta-analysis of animal studies of cauda equina compression and subsequent decompression models relationships between compression parameters and electrophysiological function. We found that compressive pressure is an important aspect of CES pathophysiology. Supplementary digital content is available in the text.

### Compressive pressure versus time in cauda equina syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies [^116a4gBk]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

The relationship between preoperative factors and outcomes in patients with acute cauda equina syndrome (CES) is unclear and has been identified as a research priority. Meta-analyses of human studies suggested that neurological outcomes are not improved when decompression is performed within 24 to 72 hours after the onset of urinary incontinence, but more recent studies have not supported this correlation. It has been suggested that neurological deterioration, which appears to be a continuous rather than a step-wise phenomenon, may be a more important determinant of prognosis than the duration of compression. Other examined predictive factors, such as the rate of symptom onset and size of the herniating disc, have yielded contradictory or non-significant results, respectively.

The variability in findings suggests that there is a large heterogeneity within CES, and further knowledge about the pathophysiological process and its effect on neurological function and prognosis might help guide the most effective management. One potential source of heterogeneity is the compressive pressure exerted by the herniating disc on the cauda equina.

A meta-analysis of animal studies testing spinal cord decompression suggested that higher compressive pressures and longer duration are associated with smaller treatment effects. A power-law relationship was found when the compressive pressure was plotted against the duration that resulted in paraplegia, with higher pressures resulting in paraparesis faster compared with lower pressures, possibly due to variation in the degree of secondary ischaemia.

### Cauda equina lesions as a complication of spinal surgery [^113dcwmR]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Although the most common etiology of cauda equina lesions is lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, iatrogenic lesions may also be the cause. This study aimed to identify and present patients in whom cauda equina lesions occurred after spinal surgery. From the author's series of patients with cauda equina lesions, those with the appearance of sacral symptoms after spinal surgery were identified. To demonstrate lesions more objectively, electrodiagnostic studies were performed in addition to history and clinical examination. Imaging studies were also reviewed.

Of the 69 patients from the series, 11 patients in whom a cauda equina lesion developed after spinal surgery were identified. The etiology comprised surgery for herniated intervertebral disc in 5 cases (4 performed by a single surgeon), spinal stenosis surgery in 4 cases, and postoperative lumbar epidural hematoma in 2 patients (each performed by a different surgeon). The proportion of spinal surgeries with this complication varied from 0 to 6.6 per thousand in different centers.

Patients with iatrogenic cauda equina lesions were significantly older (p < 0.001) and reported more severe urinary, but similar bowel and sexual symptoms compared to other patients in the series. In conclusion, the study identified spinal surgery as the cause of approximately 15% of cauda equina lesions. More than a third of lesions developed after procedures performed by a single surgeon. Most of the remaining lesions could probably be avoided by better surgical techniques, such as using a high-speed drill instead of a Kerrison rongeur.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: A systematic literature review [^1141n7qW]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is mainly caused by compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots below the conus medullaris. Clinically, symptoms and signs include low-back pain, saddle anesthesia, unilateral or bilateral sciatica, and motor weakness of the lower extremities with bladder and bowel dysfunction. However, CES is a clinical-radiological diagnosis, as clinical signs are not particularly sensitive to a CES diagnosis. A lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required for diagnosis. Gleave and McFarlane stressed the importance of categorizing CES into CES incomplete (CESI) and CES complete with urinary retention (CESR). It is deemed a surgical emergency, and there have been numerous publications and debates relating to the ideal timing for surgery. It can result in permanent damage to nerve roots, resulting in long-lasting or permanent disabling symptoms.

There is no consultation with patients in the literature regarding the importance of outcomes for CES. In addition, little is known about the long-term outcomes, which was highlighted by Korse et al, who independently decided to focus on outcomes of micturition, defecation, and sexual function. Bias in studies, lack of universal definitions, and incomplete follow-up data were seen in this systematic review.

- **Problems with not having a core outcome set (COS)**:
	- Patients are not included, so important outcomes to them may not be measured. This has been witnessed in other healthcare areas such as childhood asthma and esophageal cancer.

### Neurosarcoidosis of the cauda equina: Clinical course, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings, response to treatment, and outcomes [^116pS6nj]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical improvement was defined as complete (return to premorbid neurologic baseline with no sequelae of cauda equina disease), partial (if any improvement in symptoms or neurologic signs were detectable above cauda equina disease nadir), stable (no change in neurologic symptoms or signs), or worsened (further neurologic deterioration beyond the initial presentation to Emory despite treatment). Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were calculated retrospectively at disease nadir and again at the time of last available clinical follow-up.

Clinical symptoms were attributed predominately to disease of the cauda equina if (1) the patient's presentation was consistent with such (asymmetric findings, weakness, sensory loss, pain, and dysautonomia referable to the lumbosacral nerve roots); (2) neuroimaging did not suggest a potential alternative explanation; and (3) the majority of patient disability was due to symptoms of cauda equina disease. In the setting of comorbid myelitis as determined by spinal cord MRI, particular emphasis was placed on examination findings that could not be attributable to the chronic phase of spinal cord disease, including hyporeflexia, dermatomal patterns of sensory loss, and radicular pain. Patient presentations were classified as being secondary to two clinicoradiographic phenotypes (codominant phenotypes) if another phenotype was present and reasonably capable of substantially contributing to the patient's presentation.

### Cauda equina syndrome: Cost burden after spinal decompression [^114yMhL1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Low credibility.

The study was an observational cohort study aimed at examining the postoperative cost-associated treatments over two years following posterior spinal decompression in patients with and without cauda equina syndrome (CES). Cauda equina syndrome is a rare neurologic condition with potentially severe consequences.

By analyzing a commercial insurance claims database, patients who underwent posterior spinal decompression with a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, or disk herniation in 2017 were identified and included in the study. The primary outcome measured was the cost of payments for identified treatments over two years post-surgery. The treatments included:

1. Physical therapy (PT)
2. Pain medication
3. Injections
4. Bladder management
5. Bowel management
6. Sexual dysfunction treatment
7. Psychological treatment

A total of 3,140 patients (average age 55.3 ± 12.0 years; 62.2% male) participated in the study. The average total cost of treatments was $2,996 ± 6,368 per patient. Specifically, the overall cost of procedures was $2,969 ± 6,356 for non-CES patients compared to $4,535 ± 6,898 for CES patients (P = 0.079). Among the treatments, only PT and bladder management costs were significantly higher for patients with CES (PT: +115%, P < 0.001; bladder management: +697%, P < 0.001). A significant difference in the overall cost was observed between patients during the first year (non-CES: $1,824 ± 3,667; CES: $3,022 ± 4,679; P = 0.020), while no difference was found in the second year.

### A prospective study of the role of bladder scanning and post-void residual volume measurement in improving diagnostic accuracy of cauda equina syndrome [^111axjFt]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome (CES) remains difficult; clinical assessment has low accuracy in reliably predicting MRI compression of the cauda equina (CE). This prospective study tests the usefulness of ultrasound bladder scans as an adjunct for diagnosing CES.

- **Methods**: A total of 260 patients with suspected CES were referred to a tertiary spinal unit over a 16-month period. All were assessed by board-eligible spinal surgeons and had transabdominal ultrasound bladder scans for pre- and post-void residual (PVR) volume measurements before lumbosacral MRI.

- **Results**: The study confirms the low predictive value of 'red flag' symptoms and signs. Notably, 'bilateral sciatica' had a sensitivity of 32.4% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of only 17.2%, while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88.3%. Use of a PVR volume of ≥ 200 mL was a demonstrably more accurate test for predicting cauda equina compression on subsequent MRI (p < 0.001). The PVR sensitivity was 94.1%, specificity 66.8%, PPV 29.9%, and NPV 98.7%. The PVR allowed risk stratification with 13% of patients deemed 'low-risk' of CES. They had non-urgent MRI scans, none of which showed any cauda equina compression (p < 0.006), and no individuals developed subsequent CES in the intervening period. There were considerable cost savings associated with this strategy.

- **Conclusion**: This is the largest reported prospective evaluation of suspected CES. Use of the PVR volume ≥ 200 mL was considerably more accurate in predicting CES. It is a useful adjunct to conventional clinical assessment and allows risk stratification effectively.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: A systematic literature review [^113u1AtT]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

The systematic literature review was carried out by the main author (NS). Uncertainties and discrepancies were discussed with the research team (PRW, TM, MW, SC, and AN). Only English language articles were included. It would have been beneficial to have another independent group conduct the search strategy and data extraction independently and to compare the results achieved; however, due to limited resources, this was not performed.

### What is the incidence of cauda equina syndrome? A systematic review [^116aJT7F]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). High credibility.

In the United Kingdom, the incidence of cauda equina syndrome in 2020 was 0.4 per 100,000 person-years.
