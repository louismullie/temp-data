## Question

best treatment for acne

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for acne vulgaris. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify acne severity and why that drives therapy. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to anchor mechanism-based combinations. Next, I will review first-line options for mild-to-moderate acne, followed by escalation for moderate-to-severe disease. After that, I need to check the role of isotretinoin, including dosing and safety. I will then examine antibiotic stewardship and resistance mitigation. I should also consider hormonal therapy, light-based modalities, and maintenance strategies. Finally, I will integrate cost-effectiveness, patient-centered factors, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework because treatment choice hinges on it. Most contemporary guidance stratifies acne into mild, moderate, and severe based on lesion type and burden, with scarring or psychosocial impact shifting urgency and intensity of therapy, and I should double-check that this aligns with AAD and NICE-aligned summaries before proceeding [^112CYLLY] [^112ZDptp].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology is front and center; acne reflects four interacting pillars — altered keratinization, increased sebum, C. acnes proliferation, and inflammation — so combination therapy that hits multiple targets will outperform monotherapy, and I should verify that this principle is consistently endorsed across guidelines and consensus statements [^1151Czj9] [^114htwt7] [^1162UVfh].

> For mild-to-moderate acne, let me consider first-line topical combinations. Fixed-dose retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide (e.g., adapalene 0.1% with BPO 2.5%) is highly effective and mechanistically complementary, and I should confirm that network meta-analyses rank such combinations among the most effective topical options in this severity band [^114iXepC]. Wait, I initially thought topical retinoid monotherapy might be sufficient for most mild cases, but hold on, I should verify comparative data; fixed-combination therapy generally achieves faster and greater lesion reduction than retinoid alone in inflammatory presentations, so I will correct toward combination as preferred when tolerated, with retinoid monotherapy reserved for predominantly comedonal disease or when combination is not tolerated [^112kVXQf] [^115z6PDJ].

> Next, I should review escalation for moderate-to-severe acne. Oral tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline) combined with topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide improve outcomes and mitigate resistance, and I need to ensure duration limits are respected — about 3 months is typical, with some guidance allowing up to 6 months, always paired with non-antibiotic topicals and followed by maintenance [^111sXWYh] [^1162UVfh]. Hold on, I should verify that monotherapy with oral antibiotics is discouraged; yes, guidelines consistently advise against antibiotic monotherapy due to resistance and inferior durability of response, reinforcing the need for combination regimens and timely transition off antibiotics [^116uBu43] [^116b7tvs].

> Now, isotretinoin. I should confirm that oral isotretinoin remains the most effective single agent for severe nodulocystic acne, treatment failures, scarring, or high psychosocial burden, with network meta-analyses showing the largest mean reduction in total lesion count among all interventions, though it is not first-line for uncomplicated moderate disease due to teratogenicity and monitoring requirements [^111XYwS1] [^1119YvHd]. Let me double-check dosing nuances; standard courses target a cumulative 120–140 mg/kg, but low-dose regimens (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day or even intermittent strategies) can be effective and better tolerated in select patients, though I should confirm that intermittent dosing is not universally endorsed and remains off-label in many settings [^114yRJfs] [^115TrYKP]. I need to ensure safety counseling is explicit: iPLEDGE-equivalent risk programs, baseline and periodic labs, and mental health surveillance are essential, and I should verify that current guidance continues to support early isotretinoin for severe or scarring disease to prevent sequelae [^1162UVfh] [^115UTVrt] [^116osPQM].

> I will now examine hormonal therapy for women. Combined oral contraceptives and spironolactone are appropriate for hormonally influenced acne, particularly with menstrual flares or hyperandrogenic features, and I should confirm that spironolactone's evidence base is largely from lower-quality studies, with typical dosing 50–100 mg/day and a need to monitor for hyperkalemia and menstrual irregularities, while contraception is mandatory when teratogenic drugs are in play [^1135W71s] [^1162UVfh] [^116osPQM]. But wait, what if acne is mild and noninflammatory; I should verify that hormonal therapy is generally not first-line in that scenario, aligning with guidance to prioritize topical therapy initially and reserve hormonal options for inflammatory, persistent, or refractory cases in appropriate patients [^111sXWYh] [^1162UVfh].

> Let me consider light-based therapies. Photodynamic therapy and blue or blue-red light can reduce inflammatory lesions, but I need to check the certainty of evidence — Cochrane and subsequent reviews judge the evidence as low to very low quality with inconsistent methodology and small studies, so these modalities are best considered adjunctive or when conventional therapy is contraindicated or declined, not as routine first-line substitutes [^1153NjFm] [^113XjTKK]. Hmm, wait a minute, some reports suggest clinically meaningful improvement with PDT; I should acknowledge that while signals exist, heterogeneity and risk of bias preclude firm recommendations, reinforcing a cautious, case-by-case approach [^114iXepC] [^114M7hDg].

> Maintenance is critical. I should confirm that once control is achieved, continued topical retinoid therapy reduces relapse, and guidelines endorse maintenance regimens often pairing retinoids with benzoyl peroxide or other non-antibiotic topicals, with maintenance typically lasting months to years depending on disease trajectory and patient factors [^116TrUiV] [^1162UVfh]. Hold on, I should verify that abrupt cessation of effective topicals upon clearing increases relapse risk; yes, maintenance is consistently recommended to preserve gains and minimize recurrence [^111sXWYh].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship is explicit. Avoid oral antibiotic monotherapy, limit courses to about 3 months when possible, and always co-prescribe benzoyl peroxide to curb resistance, with explicit plans to transition off antibiotics and onto retinoid-based maintenance, which is supported by both antimicrobial resistance data and guideline consensus [^116uBu43] [^1162UVfh]. Let me reconsider any temptation to extend antibiotics indefinitely; the resistance signal strengthens with prolonged exposure and undermines durable control, so I should reinforce strict duration limits and combination strategies in counseling and orders [^116b7tvs].

> Cost-effectiveness matters in real-world care. I should double-check that for mild-to-moderate acne, fixed topical combinations and photochemical therapy are among the most cost-effective, whereas for moderate-to-severe disease, topical combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topicals, and isotretinoin are most cost-effective, findings that informed NICE guidance and can guide shared decision-making when balancing access, monitoring, and outcomes [^114HRmY5] [^115R7pf9]. Hold on, I should verify that these analyses incorporate adherence and relapse; yes, the models include discontinuation and relapse patterns, though uncertainty remains and should be discussed with patients [^114D7zTx].

> Patient-centered factors can make or break success. I should confirm that adherence is improved by setting expectations about the 6–8 week onset, teaching application technique to minimize irritation, and differentiating cosmetics from pharmaceuticals, as qualitative work shows confusion and early dropout are common without clear education and support [^1158HTxH] [^111sXWYh]. Let me think about scarring and pigment; early effective therapy reduces scar risk, and in skin of color, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is frequent, so I should tailor regimens and counseling accordingly and consider procedural options for scars once inflammation is controlled [^116LMfvF] [^1174Pp7a].

> Pulling this together, my algorithm is severity-based: for mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne, start a fixed retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide combination with supportive skincare and consider chemical peels or light therapy if accessible and acceptable. For moderate-to-severe acne, initiate oral tetracycline plus topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide with a planned 3-month course and early consideration of isotretinoin if scarring, refractoriness, or high psychosocial burden is present. For severe nodulocystic or scarring acne, proceed directly to isotretinoin with appropriate monitoring. Throughout, avoid antibiotic monotherapy, implement maintenance with retinoids, and individualize for sex, age, comorbidities, and preferences, verifying each step against guideline-concordant care and available evidence [^114iXepC] [^1162UVfh].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and evolving options. Evidence quality varies across modalities, new agents like topical anti-androgens (e.g., clascoterone) expand non-antibiotic choices, and ongoing research may refine dosing, sequencing, and safety profiles, so I need to reassess periodically and update recommendations as new high-quality data emerge [^115r98L1] [^111kckqj].

The best treatment for acne is **individualized by severity** and **combines therapies** that target multiple pathogenic factors [^1151Czj9]. For mild acne, use **topical retinoids** with **benzoyl peroxide** [^114iXepC]; for moderate-to-severe acne, add **oral antibiotics** (doxycycline or minocycline) with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide [^1162UVfh], and consider **hormonal therapy** (spironolactone or combined oral contraceptives) in women [^1162UVfh]. For severe or refractory acne, **oral isotretinoin** is the most effective option [^111XYwS1] [^114htwt7]. Combination therapy is superior to monotherapy, and maintenance with topical retinoids helps prevent relapse [^1151Czj9] [^116TrUiV].

---

## Topical treatments

Topical therapies are **first-line for mild-to-moderate acne** and are often combined to target multiple pathogenic factors [^114iXepC].

- **Topical retinoids**: normalize keratinization, reduce comedones, and have anti-inflammatory effects [^112LPiES]; adapalene is less irritating than tretinoin or tazarotene [^111HXBaj].

- **Benzoyl peroxide**: antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory; prevents antibiotic resistance when combined with antibiotics [^116uBu43].

- **Topical antibiotics**: clindamycin or erythromycin are effective but should be combined with benzoyl peroxide to limit resistance [^116osPQM].

- **Fixed-dose combinations**: adapalene/benzoyl peroxide or clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide improve adherence and efficacy [^112kVXQf].

---

## Systemic treatments

Systemic therapies are indicated for **moderate-to-severe acne** or when topical treatments fail [^1162UVfh].

- **Oral antibiotics**: doxycycline, minocycline, or sarecycline reduce inflammation and bacterial load; limit to 3–4 months and combine with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide [^115TrYKP] [^1162UVfh].

- **Hormonal therapy**: spironolactone or combined oral contraceptives are effective for women with hormonal acne [^1162UVfh].

- **Oral isotretinoin**: the most effective therapy for severe nodulocystic or refractory acne; requires monitoring for teratogenicity and adverse effects [^111XYwS1] [^114htwt7].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is **superior to monotherapy** because it targets multiple pathogenic factors — abnormal keratinization, bacterial overgrowth, and inflammation [^1151Czj9] [^112kVXQf]. Common regimens include topical retinoids with benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids with topical antibiotics, and oral antibiotics with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide [^115TrYKP].

---

## Maintenance therapy

Maintenance therapy is **essential to prevent relapse** [^116TrUiV]. Topical retinoids are the cornerstone of maintenance, often combined with benzoyl peroxide or other topical agents [^1153Zszz].

---

## Emerging and adjunctive therapies

Emerging and adjunctive therapies offer additional options, particularly for **refractory cases** or when standard therapies are contraindicated. Clascoterone, a topical anti-androgen, is effective for moderate acne [^notfound]. Light and laser therapies have limited evidence but may help select patients [^113XjTKK]. Chemical peels and photodynamic therapy can be considered for refractory cases [^113uubEX].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment should be **individualized** based on age, gender, acne severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^1162UVfh]. Special considerations include pregnancy (avoid systemic retinoids and certain antibiotics), antibiotic resistance (use combination therapy and limit antibiotic duration) [^116uBu43], and adherence (simplify regimens and provide education) [^1158HTxH].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations by severity

| **Severity** | **First-line treatment** | **Alternative/add-on therapies** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Topical retinoid + benzoyl peroxide | Topical antibiotics, azelaic acid, salicylic acid |
| Moderate | Oral antibiotic + topical retinoid + benzoyl peroxide | Hormonal therapy (women), chemical peels |
| Severe | Oral isotretinoin | Hormonal therapy, light/laser therapies |

---

The best treatment for acne is a **combination regimen** tailored to severity, with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide as foundational therapy, escalated to oral antibiotics or isotretinoin as needed, and maintenance with topical retinoids to sustain control [^1162UVfh].

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Phototherapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris: what is its role? [^112bDhK3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date, different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the current management of acne vulgaris.

### Light therapies for acne [^113XjTKK]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are light therapies effective and safe for treating acne?

Bottom Line

The evidence for all light therapies remains weak and inconclusive. Red-light methyl aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) was the only treatment associated with a small though clinically insignificant reduction in the number of inflamed lesions and in global improvement as assessed by an investigator in moderate to severe acne. Red-light MAL-PDT was not associated with higher rates of severe adverse effects than placebo or no treatment. Owing to inadequate reporting of adverse effects such as scarring or blistering, the safety of all light therapies remains uncertain.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Acne vulgaris is one of the most encountered dermatologic conditions by dermatologists worldwide. Although the true prevalence is difficult to approximate, it is estimated to affect about 9% of the population. In the US alone, 5 million physician visits are attributed to acne annually, costing > 2 billion dollars. Cumulative prevalence approaches 100% in adolescence and decreases with age, affecting up to 64% of individuals aged 20–29 years and 43% of individuals aged 30–39 years, respectively. Age, oily skin, family history, and obesity are all risk factors for developing acne. While well-powered studies comparing acne in various racial and ethnic groups are lacking, acne is regarded as very common across global populations.

Clinical Presentation

Acne is classified morphologically, including comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic, and mixed phenotypes with varying severity. Acne can affect the face, chest, and back, or a combination of these areas. Scarring and pigmentary changes are frequent, with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring being more common in skin of color.

Quality of Life

Acne may profoundly impair quality of life by limiting self-esteem and self-confidence, placing individuals at a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. Acne is associated with increased risk of self-injury and suicide attempts, highlighting the concerning and significant connection between acne and mental health. The widespread presence of acne along with its effects on quality of life underscore the importance of having a broad spectrum of treatment options targeting its various pathogenetic factors.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HLtTy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globallyand a common presentation to dermatologists. Acne may have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. A network meta‐analysis (NMA), assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments, found that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying treatment costs, including drug acquisition, time of the healthcare professional [HCP; general practitioner (GP) or specialist dermatologist] and special equipment. Evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of acne treatments is currently lacking. Thus, our study objective was to examine the cost‐effectiveness of effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using decision–analytical economic modelling.

This economic analysis informed the development of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of acne in England.NICE considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national guidance for health and social care services. The guideline was developed by a committee of clinical academics, HCPs and service users with expertise and experience in acne. The committee contributed to the development of the economic model by providing advice on the natural history of acne and its treatment patterns in England, and on model assumptions where evidence was lacking.

### Acne scarring: a review and current treatment modalities [^111BahJm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne is a prevalent condition in society and often results in secondary damage in the form of scarring. Of course, prevention is the optimal method to avoid having to correct the physically or emotionally troublesome scars. However, even with the best efforts, scars will certainly arise. This article attempts to give a broad overview of multiple management options, whether medically, surgically, or procedurally based. The hope is that a general knowledge of the current available alternatives will be of value to the physician when confronted with the difficult task of developing a treatment plan for acne-scarred individuals, even in challenging cases.

### Making the case for early treatment of acne [^116LMfvF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Early acne can be defined as the occurrence of acne at its onset, primarily in preteens, or as acne at its earliest severity (ie, mild to moderate). Although the majority of patients with acne are treated by dermatologists, most, particularly mild to moderate cases, could be successfully managed by primary care physicians. Therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits of treating all types of acne, not just the most severe. Awareness of the emotional impact of acne, particularly in adolescence, as well as recognition of possible scarring are important considerations. To achieve optimal results, physicians should be familiar with classification and severity grading of acne. Also, in-depth knowledge of available acne medications will streamline and optimize treatment regimens. Recognizing, treating, and monitoring the progress of early acne may lead to quicker, better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0·5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115NR4VL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acne vulgaris, more specifically with respect to topical therapies, AAD 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the comparison of topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, antibiotics, and their combinations directly against each other.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism. ISOTRETINOIN Oral isotretinoin, which is best absorbed when taken with meals, is recommended for severe nodular acne, and is appropriate for moderate acne in which other therapies have failed or for acne that results in scarring or causes patient distress. Low doses are effective while also decreasing related adverse effects, but it should be noted that intermittent dosing is not indicated.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^112ZDptp]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The diagnosis of acne is made on the clinical history and examination. There are no diagnostic criteria and the skin lesions seen are open comedones (whiteheads), closed comedones (blackheads), papules/nodules, cysts and scarring. There is no strong evidence base for different treatments for different acne subtypes (comedonal vs inflammatory), and NICE and most other guidelines provide different guidance on the basis of severity rather than acne subtypes. While classifications vary, the majority of acne is mild, with moderate or severe acne combined making up less than 15% of cases of acne. See table 2 for severity classifications and linked treatment choices.

### Comparative efficacy of pharmacological treatments for acne vulgaris: a network meta-analysis of 221 randomized controlled trials [^111XYwS1]. Annals of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acne is an extremely common skin disease with an estimated global prevalence of 9.4%. We aim to provide comprehensive comparisons of the common pharmacological treatments for acne.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of pharmacological therapies for acne vulgaris in patients of any age and sex and with a treatment duration of > 2 weeks were included. PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception until February 2022. Our prespecified primary end points were mean percentage reduction in total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesions. Treatment ranking was determined by P values.

Results

There were 210 articles describing 221 trials and 37 interventions included in the analysis. Our primary analysis of percentage reduction in total lesion count had 65,601 patients enrolled. Across all trials, the mean age was 20.4 years. The median duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The median total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesion counts were 72, 27, and 44, respectively. The most effective treatment was oral isotretinoin (mean difference [MD] = 48.41; P = 1.00), followed by triple therapy containing a topical antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) (MD = 38.15; p = 0.95) and by triple therapy containing an oral antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and BPO (MD = 34.83; p = 0.90). For monotherapies, oral or topical antibiotics or topical retinoids have comparable efficacy for inflammatory lesions, while oral or topical antibiotics have less effect on noninflammatory lesions.

Conclusion

The most effective treatment for acne is oral isotretinoin, followed by triple therapies containing a topical retinoid, BPO, and an antibiotic. We present detailed comparisons of each intervention to serve as a practical database.

### Photodynamic therapy for acne vulgaris: a critical review from basics to clinical practice: part I. acne vulgaris: when and why consider photodynamic therapy? [^113uubEX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral medications. However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement.

Learning Objectives

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

### Energy-based devices for the treatment of acne scars: 2022 international consensus recommendations [^117CYokR]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acne scars are one of the most distressing and long-term consequences of acne vulgaris, with damaging effect on a person's physical, mental, and social well-being. Numerous treatment options are available including surgical and nonsurgical techniques, depending on the clinical presentation. Although considerable advances in the development of new treatment technologies and applications have been made in the last decade, international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes have not yet caught up with current knowledge and practice in many centers. The authors intend to highlight the potential utility of energy-based devices (EBDs) for acne scarring, offer recommendations for safe and efficacious treatment, and provide consensus-based EBD treatment options based on varying presentations demonstrated in a series of real-life clinical photographs.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

An international panel of 24 dermatologists and plastic surgeons from 12 different countries and a variety of practice backgrounds was self-assembled to develop updated consensus recommendations for the treatment of acne scars. A two-step modified Delphi method took place between March 2020 and February 2021 consisting of two rounds of emailed questionnaires. The panel members approved the final manuscript via email correspondence.

Results

The manuscript includes a comprehensive discussion and panel recommendations regarding the following topics: 1. the role of EBD in mitigating and treating acne scars in a patient with active acne, 2. the use of various EBDs for the treatment of different acne scar types with special focus on commonly used laser platform such as vascular lasers, ablative fractional lasers (AFLs) and non-AFLs (NAFLs), 3. treatment combinations, and 4. acne scar treatments in skin of color. The last part comprised of 10 photos of real-life clinical cases with the panel recommendation treatment plan to achieve best aesthetic outcome.

Conclusion

Panel members were unanimous in their view that EBDs have a role in the management of acne scars, with AFLs, NAFLs, vascular lasers, and RF devices preferentially selected by most of the panel experts. EBDs are considered a first-line treatment for a variety of acne scar types and patients without access to these treatments may not be receiving the best available care for optimal cosmetic results. Future high-quality research and updated international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes should reflect this status.

### Adolescent acne vulgaris: current and emerging treatments [^1132g3WX]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the commonest inflammatory skin diseases seen worldwide, affecting all ethnicities and races, with a peak prevalence between age 15 years and 20 years. The burden of this condition, and the resulting clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently results in psychological and social morbidity because of concerns about appearance. As understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving the optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge. In the past few years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid receptors and androgen receptors. This Review considers the management approaches of an adolescent with acne vulgaris and reviews treatment options from the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting current treatments and novel and emerging treatment regimens are discussed.

### Acne treatment review and future perspectives [^112eF9nc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne affects approximately 9% of people worldwide and is the most common skin condition in the USA. There are abundant topical and oral treatment options available for patients with acne. First-line agents include topical retinoids, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and combinations of these agents. For recalcitrant or more severe acne, oral medications, including oral antibiotics, isotretinoin, or hormonal therapy, may be considered. This review will also discuss the many advances being made in the treatment of acne vulgaris, from the development of microencapsulated medications to targeted treatments.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111kckqj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations should reduce variation in practice, as a number of commonly used treatments showed evidence of low or no efficacy after adjusting for potential bias (e.g. some topical pharmacological monotherapies, oral antibiotic monotherapies in mild‐to‐moderate acne, hormonal contraceptives) and were thus not recommended as first‐line acne treatments. However, hormonal contraceptives were considered as options for people with acne vulgaris and PCOS, if their chosen first‐line treatment was not effective, based on available evidence specific to this population.

Further research was recommended for chemical peels, photochemical and photodynamic therapies (for which the evidence was promising but limited), for hormone‐modifying agents, e.g. metformin and spironolactone (for which no evidence was identified), and for oral isotretinoin in reduced dosage (< 0·5 mg kg −1 per day) or reduced‐dose regime (e.g. weekly or biweekly), to explore whether it is an effective, safer and better‐tolerated alternative to standard‐dose oral isotretinoin (0·5–1 mg kg −1 per day).

In conclusion, this NMA allowed evidence synthesis from a wide range of treatments for acne vulgaris stratified by severity level. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy appeared to be most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin, and photodynamic therapy appeared to be most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels and for photochemical and photodynamic therapies for which evidence was more limited and uncertain.

### Acne vaccines: therapeutic option for the treatment of acne vulgaris? [^112CzuKP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne, one of the most common skin diseases, is caused by multiple factors, including Propionibacterium acnes. Studies suggest that responses to P. acnes by host immunity play important roles in its pathogenesis. Identifying immune modulators that attenuate inflammatory responses against P. acnes and the inhibition of bacterial growth may lead to novel avenues of immunologic intervention.

### Treatment options for the patient with acne vulgaris… [^115anYbx]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

In patients with mild to moderate acne or noninflammatory comedones, topical therapy is indicated. Tretinoin reduces the formation of comedones by reversing the abnormal keratinization process. Because topical tretinoin is irritating and photosensitive, therapy usually begins with the lowest-strength cream or gel, increasing the formulation strength until the desired result is achieved. Other topical agents include salicylic acid, adapalene, azelaic acid and isotretinoin, but not all of these preparations are currently available in the United States. Topical benzoyl peroxide targets. P. acnes and is available in gels, lotions, creams and soaps. Local irritation may be reduced by using the lower-strength preparations or by applying the product less frequently. Topical bacteriostatic antibiotics such as clindamycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are effective in acne vulgaris but may induce resistant strains of P. acnes.

Combination topical therapy is commonly used in the treatment of acne, because concurrent therapy with several agents has a synergistic antimicrobial effect. Benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics and tretinoin may be used concurrently. Several agents may be combined in one preparation, but an alternating schedule of application of individual agents may be less irritating. The choice of vehicle depends on the patient's skin type. Non-greasy gels and solutions tend to dry the skin and may be preferred by patients with oily skin. Creams and lotions may be more cosmetically acceptable. Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole are used in patients with mild to moderate disease, those with affected areas that cannot be adequately covered with topical medications and those with a high potential for scarring or substantial pigmentary changes.

These medications act primarily by inhibiting bacterial growth, although some also have anti-inflammatory properties. Severe nodular acne is best treated with isotretinoin. Therapy usually continues for 20 weeks. About 15 percent of cases relapse after a single course, but most patients who relapse show enhanced results from a second course of treatment. Further courses of isotretinon are seldom necessary. Clinical improvement may continue for up to five months following a course of therapy, so retreatment should not be attempted within six months. Isotretinoin has several serious potential side effects, particularly spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations. Stringent methods of contraception are mandatory when this drug is used in women with childbearing potential.

### Treatment considerations for inflammatory acne: clinical evidence for adapalene 0.1% in combination therapies [^115BX3jh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an exceptionally common, chronic, and recurring disease. It involves multiple etiological factors including follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, Propionibacterium acnes proliferation, and inflammation. Presently, oral isotretinoin is the only single agent that is effective against all 4 major pathophysiologic features. However, this drug is also responsible for several serious side effects, including teratogenicity. Therefore, it should be used in only the most severe cases and alternative treatment approaches for inflammatory acne, such as initial combination therapy, should be considered first. Combination therapy in inflammatory acne simultaneously targets multiple pathogenic factors. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of combination therapy with a topical retinoid and antimicrobials for mild to moderate inflammatory acne and topical retinoids with oral antibiotics (with or without the use of benzoyl peroxide) for moderate to severe cases of acne, followed by maintenance therapy with topical retinoids. This review evaluates the rationale and clinical evidence for the use of adapalene in combination therapy for inflammatory acne.

### Evolution of acne assessments and impact on acne medications: an evolving, imperfect paradigm [^111qEBbk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Outcomes for success in acne interventional trials include statistically significant differences from baseline between treatment arms in lesion counts (comedonal, inflammatory and/or total) and in thresholds of categorical improvement in investigator global assessments (IGA).

Objectives

We evaluated differences in outcome measures and definition of success in acne trials; and their impact on FDA approval and indications for acne medications.

Methods

Review of acne clinical trial literature, prescribing information and regulatory guidelines for currently approved acne medications in the United States.

Results

Numerous IGA scales exist with variations in specific categorical definitions. There are also differences in definitions of global success. Outcome success may not be accurately translated into corresponding terminology for indications.

Conclusions

Variability in IGA scales and definitions of success confound comparison of trial results for acne treatments. Harmonization and standardization of these factors will facilitate meta-analytics and treatment selection in patient care. Outcome measure success has not consistently been incorporated into acne medication indications.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne [^113E4PhY]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differs by age of presentation. Current acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms.

Methods

Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed and articles identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to 2 expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing. Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed.

Results

Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Simplified treatment algorithms and recommendations are presented in detail for adolescent, preadolescent, infantile, and neonatal acne. Other considerations, including psychosocial effects of acne, adherence to treatment regimens, and the role of diet and acne, also are discussed.

Conclusions

These expert recommendations by the American Acne and Rosacea Society as reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics constitute the first detailed, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric acne including issues of special concern when treating pediatric patients.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113KPk7C]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As knowledge of acne pathogenesis expands, novel approaches for targeting inflammation are rapidly emerging in the form of topical, systemic, procedural, and combination therapies. New or modified medications within familiar classes, the repurposing of drugs used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the development of novel treatment modalities may all be efficacious in treating acne. Some of these treatments have the added benefit of decreasing and treating acne sequelae, including atrophic scarring and dyspigmentation. The diverse mechanisms of action include direct bactericidal activity against C. acnes, inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor release, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the immune system, and modulation of the microbiome. With growing concerns over antimicrobial resistance and with certain individuals unable to tolerate well-established therapies, additional treatment options that are safe and effective in all skin types and colors are needed.

### Evidence-based review: fixed-combination therapy and topical retinoids in the treatment of acne [^112kVXQf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical fixed-combination products and topical retinoid monotherapy are established first-line treatments for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, yet adequate comparative data are lacking. The following evidence-based review addresses the question: "In patients with mild-to-moderate acne, are topical fixed-combination products or topical retinoids a more efficacious choice in reducing noninflammatory, inflammatory and total lesions after 12 weeks of treatment?" To identify relevant studies, a PubMed search was performed using "acne" and search terms for adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, or erythromycin. Forty-two studies from January 1991 to November 2009 were included. The studies were evaluated using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, and all but seven received the highest level of evidence grade. To evaluate efficacy, a side-by-side comparison was made using reduction in acne lesion counts at week 12 for study groups treated with fixed-combination therapy or retinoid monotherapy. Twenty-nine studies containing relevant efficacy data for fixed-combination therapy and retinoid monotherapy are summarized here. Nine studies compared fixed-combination therapy with retinoid monotherapy; in eight of these studies, fixed-combination therapy was significantly more efficacious in reducing acne lesion counts. This evidence-based review analyzes clinical evidence to date for these therapies to provide guidance in determining appropriate treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate acne.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114D7zTx]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis explored the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. All treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (modelled as GP visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light). For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin.

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis exploring the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of treatment options for acne from a healthcare perspective, considering, in addition to drug acquisition costs, HCP resource use, including costs associated with inadequate response to treatment or relapse. Previous economic studies (identified through a systematic search conducted to inform the NICE guideline)made limited comparisons of acne treatments, and the majority considered exclusively drug acquisition costs. A number of studies were simple cost analyses and most of them were characterized by important methodological limitations (Supplementary Data S10). Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn from the existing economic literature.

In our analysis, we used efficacy and discontinuation data derived from a large systematic review and NMA. This approach combines direct (i.e. head‐to‐head comparisons) and indirect evidence (e.g. comparisons through a common comparator) and allows simultaneous comparisons across all options while preserving randomization. There was some inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence synthesized in the NMA, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in populations, treatments or study design across the included RCTs. However, NMA conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence. The RCTs included in the NMAs were of moderate to very low quality. The strengths and limitations of the source NMA and included RCTs should be considered when interpreting the cost‐effectiveness results.

The size of the evidence differed considerably across the examined treatments. Topical treatments had the largest evidence base on efficacy (several topical treatments had > 500 observations each), followed by oral treatments alone or combined with topical treatments, whereas the evidence for physical therapies (chemical peels, photochemical therapies, PDT) was based on < 300 observations for each treatment class.

### Treatments for acne vulgaris based on severity… [^111HXBaj]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids include tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene. Tretinoin and adapalene reduce total lesions by more than 50 percent, with adapalene being less irritating to skin. One trial showed similar lesion reduction with tazarotene gel. Overall, retinoids reduce lesions by 40 to 70 percent. Topical antibiotics include clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid also have antimicrobial activity. Original studies show that clindamycin and erythromycin reduce lesions to a similar degree as retinoids. Products that combine antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide are more effective than either product alone. Oral antibiotics used for the treatment of acne include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin. Studies on oral antibiotics are few and in some instances are hampered by methodological flaws. However, these agents appear to work better than placebo.

Gastrointestinal side effects and photosensitivity are associated with tetracycline and doxycycline; minocycline also causes adverse side effects, including vertigo. Perhaps of most concern is the problem of antibiotic resistance, which affects more than one half of bacterial strains in Europe. Combination therapy and avoidance of long-term therapy are recommended. Hormonal treatments include oral contraceptives and androgen-receptor blockers. One trial showed a 50 percent reduction of lesions in patients treated with oral contraceptives, compared with 30 percent in those given placebo. In Europe, newer progesterone-estrogen combinations have been shown to be effective. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone and flutamide. These agents must be used in high doses to be effective in the treatment of acne. All agents in this class also are effective when used in combination with an oral contraceptive. Isotretinoin is used for severe cases of acne.

One randomized controlled trial showed that doses of 0. 5 and 1 mg per kg per day resulted in an 80 percent or greater reduction in lesions. A single course of four to six months can be effective. Lower efficacy and higher rate of recurrence have been observed in patients treated with lower doses. In conclusion, the authors emphasize that treatment of acne should take into account fluctuations in severity and should be adjusted according to tolerance and response. In many cases, combination therapy is warranted.

### An algorithm integrating acneceuticals into the management of acne vulgaris [^116PVRne]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic cutaneous disorder with numerous efficacious prescription and procedural treatments. Therapy, however, is hampered by medication intolerability and compromised by non-adherence. The use of acneceuticals is an effective way to improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 5 dermatologists met for a consensus conference in October 2023 to identify a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating acneceuticals with prescription medications and procedures.

Results

The algorithm stratifies the use of acneceuticals first as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or maintenance therapy and then further diverges by skin phenotype (oily or dry/sensitive) and primary lesion morphology (comedonal or inflammatory). Finally, specific acneceuticals are recommended for each phenotypic description.

Conclusion

The algorithm is intended to serve as a guideline for integrating active nonprescription skin care into prescription acne therapy, improving efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, resulting in superior patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(4):376–380. doi:10.36849/JDD.8887.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^115Vfmg9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

### Inflammatory acne treatment: review of current and new topical therapeutic options [^115aJNGH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by the presence of comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules. Consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy using different drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to best address as many acne pathogenic factors as possible at the same time. Topical acne medications exist as individual agents that may be combined in physician-recommended regimens or as pre-formulated fixed-dose combination products. In addition, there are several new and promising topical therapies currently being developed that work by different mechanisms of action from traditionally used acne therapies. The following review will cover commonly used drugs, newcomers to the market, and what the future holds for the topical treatment of AV.

### Topical vehicle formulations in the treatment of acne [^114XxfeM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Topical treatment is the mainstay of acne therapy. The most commonly prescribed topical medications for acne include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and retinoids. Despite their effectiveness in treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, these topical medications are found to be irritating, and are historically associated with poor tolerability and diminished patient adherence. Thus, choosing the right formulation that will be effective and well tolerated is essential. Novel formulations that optimize drug concentration and utilize improved delivery vehicles have helped to enhance the tolerability and efficacy, and allow for less frequent application or co-application of drugs that were previously considered incompatible. This article will review the goals of topical therapy for the treatment of acne, in addition to common therapies and their challenges. Advanced formulations and combination formulations of benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and tretinoin will also be discussed. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(6 Suppl):s6–10.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^115r98L1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

### Light therapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^115iQHGi]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, lasers and light-based systems have become a common modality to treat a wide variety of skin-related conditions, including acne vulgaris. In spite of the various oral and topical treatments available for the treatment of acne, many patients fail to respond adequately or may develop side effects. Therefore, there is a growing demand by patients for a fast, safe, and side-effect-free novel therapy.

Objectives

To address the role of light therapy in the armamentarium of treatments for acne vulgaris, to discuss photobiology aspects and biomedical optics, to review current technologies of laser/light-based devices, to review the clinical experience and results, and to outline clinical guidelines and treatment considerations.

Results

Clinical trials show that 85% of the patients demonstrate a significant quantitative reduction in at least 50% of the lesions after four biweekly treatments. In approximately 20% of the cases, acne eradication may reach 90%. At 3 months after the last treatment, clearance is approximately 70% to 80%. The nonrespondent rate is 15% to 20%.

Conclusions

Laser and light-based therapy is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. Amelioration of acne by light therapy, although comparable to the effects of oral antibiotics, offers faster resolution and fewer side effects and leads to patient satisfaction.

### Acne vulgaris [^114htwt7]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production, altered keratinisation, inflammation, and bacterial colonisation of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest, and back by Propionibacterium acnes. Although early colonisation with P acnes and family history might have important roles in the disease, exactly what triggers acne and how treatment affects the course of the disease remain unclear. Other factors such as diet have been implicated, but not proven. Facial scarring due to acne affects up to 20% of teenagers. Acne can persist into adulthood, with detrimental effects on self-esteem. There is no ideal treatment for acne, although a suitable regimen for reducing lesions can be found for most patients. Good quality evidence on comparative effectiveness of common topical and systemic acne therapies is scarce. Topical therapies including benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antibiotics when used in combination usually improve control of mild to moderate acne. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives can help women with acne. Patients with more severe inflammatory acne usually need oral antibiotics combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease antibiotic-resistant organisms. Oral isotretinoin is the most effective therapy and is used early in severe disease, although its use is limited by teratogenicity and other side-effects. Availability, adverse effects, and cost, limit the use of photodynamic therapy. New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.

### Oral isotretinoin: new developments relevant to clinical practice [^111YVv6F]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Oral isotretinoin is unrivalled in efficacy and remission capability for treatment of acne. In addition to appropriate monitoring and continued vigilance for safety concerns, appropriate dosing to mitigate avoidable dose-dependent adverse effects is the responsibility of prescribers. Low-dose regimens are better tolerated and effective in inducing acne clearance. Although much progress has been made since the advent of isotretinoin, there remain many unanswered questions regarding optimization to maximize response while minimizing the potential for avoidable adverse events. The ongoing availability of isotretinoin is imperative to patients with acne, their caregivers, and physicians.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^1153T8ps]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical model inputs

Relative effects on efficacy [percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline (%CFB)], discontinuation due to any reason and discontinuation due to side effects were obtained from the source NMA(Supplementary Data S2). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the economic analysis considered only treatments with evidence of efficacy in a bias‐adjusted NMA, owing to indication of small study bias.

To obtain absolute effects for each treatment and outcome, we combined NMA relative effects with absolute effects of a reference treatment. We selected adapalene (topical retinoid) as the reference treatment based on data availability. Absolute effects for adapalene were estimated from large RCTs included in the source NMA, and discontinuation data from a small non‐UK observational study(Supplementary Data S3).

Patients' perception of their acne improvement may differ from the clinical measurement of improvement as expressed by %CFB. The relationship between the two (Table 2) was determined using published trial evidence. The same evidencewas used to determine the distribution around the mean %CFB at treatment endpoint, in order to estimate the proportion of people with excellent, good, moderate and no improvement for each treatment (Supplementary Data S4). Owing to limited and heterogeneous evidence, the risk of relapse following excellent, good and moderate improvement was based on expert opinion.

Utility data

Utility values express people's preferences regarding health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health) and are necessary for estimating QALYs. The utility values used in the economic model (Table 2) were determined using utility data from two studies, identified from a systematic search, a published mapping algorithm, utility values of the UK general young adult populationand further assumptions (Supplementary Data S5).

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HRmY5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild-to-moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate-to-severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost-effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost-effectiveness of treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision-analytical model compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost-effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild-to-moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost-effective. For moderate-to-severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost-effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost-effective for the management of acne. Well-conducted studies are needed to examine the long-term clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Safety considerations and monitoring in patients treated with systemic medications for acne [^115eKbEy]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, is one of the most commonly encountered conditions in dermatology practice. Effective treatment of acne vulgaris is important in that it can prevent psychosocial distress and physical scarring. Systemic therapeutic options are available for moderate to severe acne. It is imperative that the safe and effective treatment revolves around the health care provider's familiarity of side effects of various treatments. In this article, the side effects and monitoring guide for the most commonly prescribed systemic agents for acne vulgaris are reviewed.

### Systematic review of low-dose isotretinoin for treatment of acne vulgaris: focus on indication, dosage, regimen, efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and follow up, based on clinical studies [^114yRJfs]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe acne and its side effects are mostly dose-dependent. Low dose isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 1 week every 4weeks for 6-months) could be effective and even in its end result, comparable with high or optimal doses. In this systematic review, we aimed to sum up the results of clinical trials regarding indications, dosage, prescription protocol, effectiveness, side effects, patient satisfaction, recurrence rate, and follow-up period of low dose isotretinoin in treatment of acne. Cochrane, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Medline were searched. A total of 460 articles were searched electronically and 382 articles were excluded. About 4 were non-English and 2, before 1980. The full text of 72 articles was reviewed. Finally 15 documents met the inclusion criteria for entering this systematic review. The standard dose of isotretinoin is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 4 months with a total dose of 120–140mg/kg/day. Daily doses between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg can be recommended for more than 6 months due to the occurrence of fewer side effects and more economical concerns. For greater effectiveness, it could be combined with other medications.

### Practical management of acne for clinicians: an international consensus from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne [^113jzxeo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Scientific advances are continually improving the knowledge of acne and contributing to the refinement of treatment options; it is important for clinicians to regularly update their practice patterns to reflect current standards. The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne is an international group of dermatologists with an interest in acne research and education that has been meeting regularly since 2001. As a group, we have continuously evaluated the literature on acne. This supplement focuses on providing relevant clinical guidance to health care practitioners managing patients with acne, with an emphasis on areas where the evidence base may be sparse or need interpretation for daily practice.

### Acne therapy: a methodologic review [^114445Bw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acne is a very common problem with significant physical and psychological morbidity. The evidence basis for its treatment had not been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we performed an evidence review to provide researchers a basis for further studies, and to provide clinicians the background needed to interpret current and future clinical studies.

Objective

We summarize the methodologic state of the acne literature in patients with acne who do not have complicating co-morbidities.

Methods

This was an expert-advised literature synthesis. We used a structured literature search for English-language controlled trials in Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, HSTAT, CINAHL, and PsychInfo. Results underwent a structured data abstraction process, with review by at least 2 reviewers.

Results

Out of 1588 unique articles, 250 articles (274 controlled trials) over the past 50 years were reviewed: 57 (21%) trials had at least one major weakness and no strengths; 125 (47%) trials had at least one major strength and at least one major weakness; 48 (18%) trials had at least one major strength, and no major weaknesses. The remaining 16 (6%) were of intermediate quality or did not provide enough information to make a determination. One fourth of studies did not report patient age; one fourth did not report on patient gender. Only 8% mentioned patient race; only 2% mentioned skin type; 0.4% mentioned diet; none scored sexual maturity or insurance status. There were 1237 outcomes. There were more than 25 methods of assessing acne severity and more than 19 methods for counting lesions. There were only two trials that formally assessed psychological outcomes. More than 140 treatments were tested in 251 comparisons.

Conclusion

Ranging over 50 years of research, the acne literature evidences great heterogeneity at all levels: patient characteristics, acne severity, outcome assessments, treatments, and comparisons. A list of methodologic recommendations is provided.

### A comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of retinoid-containing combination regimens for the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11589BCn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Many physicians regularly prescribe combination therapy involving a retinoid for their acne patients. The most common retinoid-containing regimens include either oral antibiotics or topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotic products. A fair number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these combination therapies, but there is a lack of comparative studies examining different regimens head-to-head. Also, many of the noncomparative studies have very similar trial designs. A review of these studies was conducted in order to organize the available data side by side from the different regimens. Although not derived from comparative studies, this presentation of data is expected to provide dermatologists with valuable information from which they can easily make their own comparisons among similarly designed trials.

### Topical, light-based, and complementary interventions for acne: an overview of systematic reviews [^115cAkoT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease of the pilosebaceous unit (the skin structure consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland). It is characterised by non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). Lesions may be present on the face, thorax, and back, with variable severity. Acne exhibits a global distribution and has a growing prevalence. Acne vulgaris is the most common form. Acne gives rise to complications such as scars and can seriously affect people's mental health, especially those with severe acne. Acne has a huge impact on the quality of life and self-esteem of those affected.

Objectives

To synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-systemic pharmacological interventions and non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy and complementary therapies) in the treatment of acne vulgaris and related skin complications.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, and Embase to 2 December 2021, and checked the reference lists of included reviews. At least two authors were responsible for screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. We excluded reviews with high risk of bias as assessed with the ROBIS tool. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence according to GRADE (as carried out by the authors of the included reviews or ourselves). We provide comprehensive evidence from the review data, including summary of findings tables, summary of results tables, and evidence maps.

Main Results

We retrieved and assessed a total of 733 records; however, only six reviews (five Cochrane reviews and one non-Cochrane review) with low risk of bias met the overview inclusion criteria. The six reviews involved 40,910 people with acne from 275 trials and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 trials. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with an average age range from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. Main results for clinically important comparisons: Benzoyl peroxide versus placebo or no treatment: In two trials involving 1012 participants over 12 weeks, benzoyl peroxide may reduce the total (mean difference (MD) -16.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.51 to -5.78), inflammatory (MD -6.12, 95% CI -11.02 to -1.22), and non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -9.69, 95% CI -15.08 to -4.29) when compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials including 1073 participants (time point: 10 and 12 weeks) suggested benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect in improving participants' global self-assessment compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.22; very low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggested that benzoyl peroxide may improve investigators' global assessment (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28; 6 trials, 4110 participants, long-term treatment (12 weeks)) compared to placebo. Thirteen trials including 4287 participants over 10 to 12 weeks suggested benzoyl peroxide may increase the risk of a less serious adverse event compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical retinoids: Benzoyl peroxide may increase the percentage change in total lesion count compared to adapalene (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 10.8, 95% CI 3.38 to 18.22; 1 trial, 205 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). When compared to adapalene, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts (MD -7.7, 95% CI -16.46 to 1.06; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), percentage change in non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -3.9, 95% CI -13.31 to 5.51; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 4 trials, 1123 participants, 11 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigators' global assessment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37; 3 trials, 1965 participants, 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, 1573 participants, 5 trials, 11 to 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical antibiotics: When compared to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): total lesion counts (MD -3.50, 95% CI -7.54 to 0.54; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), inflammatory lesion counts (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.99 to 0.59; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -2.4, 95% CI -5.3 to 0.5; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 trial, 240 participants, 10 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigator's global assessment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45; 2 trials, 2277 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.64; 5 trials, 2842 participants, 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). For these clinically important comparisons, no review collected data for the following outcomes: frequency of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event or quality of life. No review collected data for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids versus placebo or no treatment, or topical retinoids versus topical antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarises the evidence for topical therapy, phototherapy, and complementary therapy for acne and acne scars. We found no high-certainty evidence for the effects of any therapy included. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews related to acne and acne scars had limitations (low methodological quality). We could not summarise the evidence for topical retinoids and topical antibiotics due to insufficient high-quality systematic reviews. Future research should consider pooled analysis of data on new emerging drugs for acne treatment (e.g. clascoterone) and focus more on acne complications.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^11722LS1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### Practical considerations in acne treatment and the clinical impact of topical combination therapy [^113jUK2G]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent, multifactorial disease process affecting the pilosebaceous units of the dermis. The effects of acne are profound both physically and psychosocially across all age groups and ethnicities; therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches range from simple monotherapy to multimodal treatments with a variety of topical and systemic agents. Optimal patient outcomes in acne management, however, are based both on treatment efficacy as well as overall patient satisfaction. In an effort to comprehensively address these key clinical considerations in acne management, we examine the diverse nature of acne patients, the factors in optimizing treatment outcomes, and the clinical impact of current medications, particularly topical combination therapy.

### Topical retinoid and antibiotic combination therapy for acne management [^116jzhp3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The agents most commonly used in combination for the management of acne include topical retinoids and antibiotics. Topical retinoids normalize desquamation of the follicular epithelium, whereas antibiotics inhibit the growth of P. acnes and the production of free fatty acids. This therapeutic combination decreases comedogenesis, bacterial growth, and inflammation, thus targeting three of the four pathogenic factors associated with acne. Efficacy and tolerance are maximized with combination therapy, and the degree of skin irritation is minimized. Furthermore, adjunctive therapy with topical retinoids and antibiotics tends to produce results more quickly than single-agent therapy. This article will examine the individual agents used in combination for acne management, and discuss the mechanisms by which they achieve efficacy. The rationale of utilizing topical retinoids with antibiotics will be highlighted, particularly in relation to improved tolerance and reduced irritation.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^1135W71s]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

While endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing some new insights, this systematic review has highlighted existing important gaps in the evidence about how best to utilize oral spironolactone in managing acne in women, including clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize the risk of side effects, the lowest effective dose, the possible requirement for concomitant therapies and what these should be, which types of acne are likely to be responsive, and how effective spironolactone is compared with standard therapies. It is interesting to note that several current acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone on the basis of consensus and/or expert opinion. Others either do not mention spironolactone, or specifically say it is regarded as ineffective, not recommended or there is insufficient evidence to support its use. All, including those that purport to be evidence-based, have failed to identify the majority of studies that were included in this systematic review. Although there were five relevant studies that, to date, have proved unobtainable (two of which were almost certainly duplicate publications of included case series), we are confident that all the RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until such time as higher quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will have to continue to rely on recommendations largely based on expert experience or reached via consensus of expert panels. While this review has identified some very-low-quality evidence which showed that the 200 mg daily dose was statistically significantly more effective than placebo versus inflamed lesions, it has also confirmed that this dose is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse side effects than lower doses. Hence, there would appear to be no merit in using these higher doses for managing acne, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. in obese women with PCOS). Data from the multiple case series suggest that any future RCT examining lower doses is likely to generate results that confirm the effectiveness and better safety profile of doses ≤ 100 mg/day.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acne [^116osPQM]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is the most common skin disorder in the United States. Therapy targets the four factors responsible for lesion formation: increased sebum production, hyperkeratinization, colonization by Propionibacterium acnes, and the resultant inflammatory reaction. Treatment goals include scar prevention, reduction of psychological morbidity, and resolution of lesions. Grading acne based on lesion type and severity can help guide treatment. Topical retinoids are effective in treating inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions by preventing comedones, reducing existing comedones, and targeting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide is an over-the-counter bactericidal agent that does not lead to bacterial resistance. Topical and oral antibiotics are effective as monotherapy, but are more effective when combined with topical retinoids. The addition of benzoyl peroxide to antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of bacterial resistance. Oral isotretinoin is approved for the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne and can be safely administered using the iPLEDGE program. After treatment goals are reached, maintenance therapy should be initiated. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of laser and light therapies. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered if treatment goals are not met.

### Laser treatment of acne scarring in skin of colour [^1174Pp7a]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects patients of all skin types. Acne scarring affects up to 95% of patients. Laser treatment is the most effective treatment for acne scarring. Adverse effects (AEs) include pain, infection, erythema, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), hypopigmentation and scarring. Patients with darker skin types are more prone to developing PIH, arising as a result of inflammation, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic. There is concern that laser treatment may not be suitable for patients with skin of colour (SOC) due to the risks of AEs. However, the use of appropriate treatment protocols can help to mitigate these risks. Clinicians should consider the type of acne scarring and skin type of the patient when choosing the most appropriate laser. Laser treatments should be offered to patients with SOC, who should be fully informed of the risks before embarking on treatment. It is important to note that no treatment will eliminate scarring completely, but lasers can significantly improve the appearance of acne scars. Laser treatment for acne scarring can be performed safely and effectively when tailored to the patient's needs and skin type. Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of lasers for patients with SOC.

### What's new in acne? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2009–2010 [^114Hy3L4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

This review highlights clinically important findings about acne treatment identified in nine systematic reviews published or indexed in the period March 2009 to February 2010. A systematic review of dietary influences on acne suggested that a possible role of dietary factors in acne cannot be dismissed, as the studies to date have not been sufficiently large or robust. Another review looked at benzoyl peroxide, which may be enjoying a comeback because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, and suggested that there was a lack of evidence that stronger preparations were more effective than weaker ones. The same team also carried out a systematic review addressing the question of whether topical retinoids cause an initial worsening of acne. They found no evidence to suggest initial worsening of acne severity, although there was evidence of skin irritation that typically settled by 8–12 weeks. A review of oral isotretinoin and psychiatric side-effects reinforced a possible link between the two, although it pointed out that the better-quality primary studies were still inconclusive. An updated Cochrane Review confirmed the efficacy of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in reducing acne lesion counts. It also found that the evidence to support COCs containing cyproterone acetate over others was very limited. Another Cochrane Review failed to show any benefit of spironolactone for acne, based on limited studies. Three reviews examined laser and light therapies, and found some evidence of superiority only for blue or blue/red light treatment over placebo light, but a general absence of comparisons against other acne treatments. Photodynamic therapy had consistent benefits over placebo but was associated with significant side-effects and was not shown to be better than topical adapalene.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114iXepC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26·16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16·75–35·36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39·70%, 95% CrI 12·54–66·78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35·36%, 95% CrI 17·75–53·08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44·43%, 95% CrI 29·20–60·02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg −1 per single course (58·09%, 95% CrI 36·99–79·29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40·45%, 95% CrI 26·17–54·11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43·53%, 95% CrI 29·49–57·70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Treatment of acne in children [^115mGhs4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne is a common skin condition in adolescents. It is not uncommon in childhood and it persists into adulthood. A broad range of acne treatments are available and have been shown to be safe and effective in adolescents and adults. However, there is limited literature regarding acne treatment in childhood and its available therapeutic options. It seems reasonable to extrapolate findings of the various studies reported on treatment of acne in the adolescent and adult age group, with the exclusion of the use of tetracycline derivatives. As clinicians, we must be more familiar with the clinical presentation of acne and available treatment options in our younger patients. Early recognition of acne with prompt and appropriate initiation of therapy in childhood will help prevent severe scarring in children.

### Identifying and appraising patient-reported outcome measures on treatment satisfaction in acne: a systematic review [^114DTbrm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Core outcome sets are consensus‐based minimum outcome measures that should be reported in clinical trials of a specific disease or target condition. Outcomes can be conceived as constructs or domains, credibly established by patients and other relevant stakeholders, reflecting what is to be measured in trial participants to evaluate the effect of an intervention. Outcome measures are instruments or tools to measure the quality or quantity of the intervention on each of the domains. These measures can range from clinical examinations to patient responses to questionnaires to laboratory findings and to imaging studies. Outcome measures to be included in a core outcome set are based on a systematic search, assessment of quality and recommendations to a voting panel for inclusion of only one outcome measurement for each domain where possible. In the absence of an adequate measure, a need for development would be established.

In clinical trials investigating acne treatments, multiple outcome measures have been used with no established standards. This multiplicity, heterogeneity and lack of quality have been problematic in data synthesis by impeding comparative outcomes research and contributing to resource wastage. An international consensus on a core outcome set for clinical trials in acne could address this unmet need by standardizing and harmonizing existing outcome measures, and identifying those that might be lacking.

Development of an acne core outcome set for acne clinical trials was initiated with the Acne Core Outcomes Research Network (ACORN), initially funded by a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases grant (1U01AR065109‐01). In a landmark study involving stakeholders worldwide, including 307 patients or their parents, 218 healthcare professionals, 45 nonclinical researchers, 17 industry employees and nine journal editors, the most important domains for an acne core outcome set were identified. These included satisfaction with appearance, extent of dark marks and scars, long‐term acne control, signs and symptoms, satisfaction with treatment, health‐related quality of life and adverse events (AEs).

A hierarchy of treatment satisfaction can extend from procedures, therapies, activity limitations and dietary restrictions, along with included medications. A more circumscribed concept of satisfaction with intervention or medication impacting on disease signs/symptoms and potential side‐effects is relevant to clinical trials.

In this study, we focused on addressing treatment satisfaction in acne clinical trials, more specifically on satisfaction with any intervention or with the (general) care received. Our aims were to identify patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMS) of satisfaction with acne treatments and to evaluate their quality with COnsensus‐based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^115DvHbg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we found a range of views about topical treatments and oral antibiotics that could lead to early termination of treatment and progression to alternative treatments for acne. It is important for patients to be told that acne can be a chronic condition which requires either long‐term and/or maintenance therapy to reduce the potential for relapse. Our findings highlight the importance of health professionals directing patients towards high‐quality evidence‐based information about acne, particularly to help them understand treatment options, emphasize the delayed onset of action of many acne treatments and how to mitigate against side‐effects. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways in which support can be provided for young people with acne to help them manage the condition.

### Antibiotic resistance in acne treatment [^116uBu43]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the evidence for antibiotic resistance in acne, and how does resistance affect treatment?

Bottom Line

Use of topical and systemic antibiotics for acne is associated with formation of resistance in Propionibacterium acnes and other bacteria, with clinical consequences. Guidelines recommend resistance reduction strategies including avoidance of antibiotic monotherapy, combination treatment with topical modalities, and limiting the duration of oral antibiotic use.

### New insights into the management of acne: an update from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne group [^117L3WgE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne published recommendations for the management of acne as a supplement to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2003. The recommendations incorporated evidence-based strategies when possible and the collective clinical experience of the group when evidence was lacking. This update reviews new information about acne pathophysiology and treatment-such as lasers and light therapy-and relevant topics where published data were sparse in 2003 but are now available including combination therapy, revision of acne scarring, and maintenance therapy. The update also includes a new way of looking at acne as a chronic disease, a discussion of the changing role of antibiotics in acne management as a result of concerns about microbial resistance, and factors that affect adherence to acne treatments. Summary statements and recommendations are provided throughout the update along with an indication of the level of evidence that currently supports each finding. As in the original supplement, the authors have based recommendations on published evidence as much as possible.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115r83ou]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment outcomes

Efficacy of each treatment class relative to placebo is shown in Table 1 for mild‐to‐moderate acne and Table 2 for moderate‐to‐severe acne. In each analysis, treatment classes have been ordered from best to worst using their mean ranking for females. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, bias‐adjusted results are presented, as there was indication of bias owing to small study size in this evidence; base‐case results (before bias adjustment) are shown in Appendix S15 (see Supporting Information). Large uncertainty in the results for most treatments was indicated by wide 95% CrIs around mean effects and rankings.

Table 1
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in mild‐to‐moderate acne: bias‐adjusted treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

Table 2
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in moderate‐to‐severe acne: treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

No evidence of effect on treatment discontinuation for any reason was found for any treatment class compared with placebo at either acne severity level. In mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical retinoids, BPO and their combination showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo; in moderate‐to‐severe acne (bias‐adjusted analysis), topical retinoids alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, oral cocyprindiol alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, and oral tetracycline alone showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo (Appendix S15).

Relative effects between all pairs of treatment classes (including results from indirect and available head‐to‐head comparisons) are reported in Appendix S16 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

After excluding antibiotic monotherapies, physical treatments and oral isotretinoin, which the committee considered unsuitable first‐line treatments owing to associated potential harms or lack of routine availability and use, threshold analysis suggested that conclusions for mild‐to‐moderate acne were fairly robust to changes in the evidence. In moderate‐to‐severe acne, a moderate change in the evidence would lead to BPO entering the top four efficacious treatments that were eligible for a recommendation (Appendix S17; see Supporting Information).

### Hormonal therapy for acne: why not as first line therapy? facts and controversies [^113b5BEB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Standard systemic therapeutic agents used in acne include oral antimicrobials, isotretinoin, and hormonal agents. Appropriate patient selection is the key to decide when to use hormonal agents as first-line therapy as well as to achieve optimal results. Indications of hormonal therapy in acne in girls and women include proven ovarian or adrenal hyperandrogenism, recalcitrant acne, acne not responding to repeated courses of oral isotretinoin, acne tarda, polycystic ovary syndrome, or the presence of clinical signs of hyperandrogenism such as androgenic alopecia or the presence of the seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, alopecia syndrome. We describe the hormonal agents currently available for acne treatment, discuss their indications and contraindications, and address the question of whether they may be used as a first-line therapy in acne.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^111sXWYh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Light therapies for acne [^1153NjFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for light therapies.

Objectives

To explore the effects of light treatment of different wavelengths for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 71 studies, randomising a total of 4211 participants. Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly. Selection and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear. Comparisons of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies, including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light) concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of 20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively. For our second primary outcome 'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360 participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51 to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical difference between these two interventions for lesion counts. Studies comparing the effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects. Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light therapies. Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking. There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne. Carefully planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

### Network analysis finds oral isotretinoin most effective for… [^1119YvHd]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most effective therapies for acne vulgaris. Bottom Line Oral isotretinoin was the most effective therapy for decreasing the number of lesions in patients with acne. However, oral isotretinoin is not considered first-line therapy. Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide combined with oral or topical antibiotics were comparably effective in achieving the assessment of treatment success. Another analysis suggested starting treatment with adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin plus benzoyl peroxide, or adapalene alone. They included 210 papers with 65, 601 patients. The median duration of the studies was 12 weeks. The studies evaluated six oral antibiotics, five topical antibiotics, oral isotretinoin, five topical retinoids, six combined oral contraceptives, topical clascoterone, 10 combination therapies, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and placebo.

The most common outcomes were disease-oriented inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, but 69 studies reported the investigators' global assessment of success. No study reported patients' self-assessments. Overall, the studies were of decent quality. Oral isotretinoin was the most effective agent at decreasing the number of lesions, followed by combination therapy. For patients with inflammatory lesions, oral isotretinoin was also the most effective, followed by a combination of topical antibiotics plus azelaic acid. The effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives was inconsistent, possibly due to studies that included patients without hormonally sensitive acne.

Using the investigators' assessment of treatment success, topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide combined with oral or topical antibiotics were comparable. Patients taking topical trifarotene had the greatest odds of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. There were moderate to high degrees of heterogeneity among the data. There was no strong evidence of publication bias.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^115LPGJW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with significant negative impact on quality of life and mental health. Acne is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, with long-lasting sequelae including scarring and dyspigmentation, the latter of which is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alteration of sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Newer research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiologic categories. This greater understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These modalities include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article will provide an overview of emerging treatments of acne and their link to our current and improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^112WB78f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 4 shows the results of the economic analysis for treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne (same for both sexes) and for moderate‐to‐severe acne in females. Results for treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne in males (Supplementary Table S1) differed from those for females only in the ranking of oral isotretinoin, which was higher for males and is attributable to its lower intervention cost due to less intensive monitoring compared with females. The results are characterized by uncertainty, reflected in the wide 95% CIs around mean rankings.

Table 4
Cost‐effectiveness results for treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. a, b

The cost‐effectiveness plane (Fig. 2) depicts the mean incremental costs and QALYs of all treatments vs. treatment with placebo (placed at the origin) in each analysis, ordered by magnitude of clinical benefits (QALYs). The cost‐effectiveness acceptability frontier(Fig. 3) shows the most cost‐effective treatments for a range of values of WTP for a QALY (between £0 and £40 000 per QALY) and the probability of each treatment being cost‐effective.

Figure 2
Cost‐effectiveness planes. Results for 1000 people with acne vulgaris. In each graph, the points for each treatment show its incremental quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) (horizontal axis) and costs (vertical axis) vs. treatment with placebo, which is placed at the origin. The slope of the dotted line indicates the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence lower cost‐effectiveness threshold of £20 000/QALY. Moving towards the right of the horizontal axis, treatments result in more QALYs. For both acne severity levels, all treatments produce more QALYs compared with treatment with placebo. Moving towards the top of the vertical axis, treatments become more costly. For both acne severity levels, all treatments are more costly than treatment with placebo, with the exception of BPO in mild‐to‐moderate acne, and with the exception of BPO, topical clindamycin, combined topical tretinoin with clindamycin, oral lymecycline, and azelaic acid combined with oral lymecycline in moderate‐to‐severe acne. In all three graphs, treatments lie on the right side of the dotted line, suggesting that in all three analyses all assessed treatments are cost‐effective compared with treatment with placebo.

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^116WCbmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free‐text terms and study‐type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).

Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta‐analysis

A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. Reported severity levels in each study were used for study categorization into mild‐to‐moderate or moderate‐to‐severe acne. Based on the committee's expert advice, if severity was unclear or reported as 'moderate', the study was categorized as mild‐to‐moderate acne if each participant had only noninflammatory lesions, or < 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≤ 30, whereas the study was categorized as moderate‐to‐severe acne if each participant had ≥ 3 nodules (regardless of the number of other inflammatory lesions), or ≥ 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≥ 40. If this information could not be obtained or the mean number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was 31–39, the study was excluded from the review.

### Oral antibiotics for acne [^116b7tvs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral antibiotics are integral for treating inflammatory acne based on what is understood about the pathogenesis as well as the role of Cutibacterium acnes. However, rising concerns of antibiotic resistance and the perception of "antibiotic phobia" create potential limitations on their integration in an acne treatment regimen. When prescribing oral antibiotics, dermatologists need to consider dosage, duration, and frequency, and to avoid their use as monotherapy. These considerations are important, along with the use of newer strategies and compounds, to reduce adverse-event profiles, antibiotic resistance, and to optimize outcomes. Aside from concomitant medications, allergies, and disease severity, costs and patient demographics can influence variability in prescribing plans. There are multiple published guidelines and consensus statements for the USA and Europe to promote safe antibiotic use by dermatologists. However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies and evidence for comparative superiority of any individual antibiotic, as well as any evidence to support the use of agents other than tetracyclines. Although oral antibiotics are one of the main options for moderate to severe acne, non-antibiotic therapy such as isotretinoin and hormonal therapies should be considered. As newer therapies and more outcomes data emerge, so will improved management of antibiotic therapy to foster patient safety.

### Acne and craniofacial defects [^1173XPSS]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for the acne in a patient with this condition?
A. Topical retinoid
B. Oral antibiotic
C. Isotretinoin
D. Topical antibiotic
E. Benzoyl peroxide

Answers:
A. Topical retinoid – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin, not topical, is found to be most effective at resolving acneiform lesions associated with Apert syndrome.
B. Oral antibiotic – Incorrect. Although tetracyclines inhibit the FGFR2b downstream expression and activity of metalloproteinases, this inhibition has not been sufficient in treating this gain-of-function FGF2 mutation.
C. Isotretinoin – Correct. The onset of acne in Apert syndrome, and often oily skin, occurs in early puberty. When androgen levels increase, they promote FGF synthesis, activate the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation, and cause the severe acneiform lesions in these patients. FGF2b signaling is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne. Although most drugs target single regions of the FGF2b signaling cascade, oral retinoids disrupt multiple regulatory steps and signals in the FGFR2 pathway and therefore provide the most effective treatment for patients with the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation. However, depending on the acne severity, isotretinoin may not be required in all patients. A risk-benefit assessment should be made on an individual case basis because of the numerous known potential side effects of isotretinoin. Of concern, the disruption of FGFR2 signaling during embryonic development yields a teratogenicity risk in postpubertal females.
D. Topical antibiotic – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin therapy is the best therapy for these patients.
E. Benzoyl peroxide – Incorrect. Although benzoyl peroxide is effective in interrupting acne pathogenesis through the degradation of lysosomal receptors and downregulation of FGFR2b, it is not sufficient in Apert syndrome. The gain-of-function FGF2 mutation in Apert syndrome requires multiple levels of pathway inhibition for successful treatment.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris [^112LPiES]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes.

Objective

To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004.

Study Selection

Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article.

Data Extraction

Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity.

Data Synthesis

Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.

### Japanese Dermatological Association guidelines: guidelines for the treatment of acne vulgaris 2017 [^1153Zszz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The Guidelines for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris of the Japanese Dermatological Association was first published in Japanese in 2008 and revised in 2016 and 2017. These guidelines (GL) indicate the standard acne treatments in Japan and address pharmaceutical drugs and treatments applicable or in use in Japan. In these GL, the strength of the recommendation is based on clinical evidences as well as availability in Japanese medical institutions. In the 2016 and 2017 GL, some of the clinical questions were revised, and other questions were added in accordance with approval of topical medicines containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Rather than monotherapies of antibiotics, the 2017 GL more strongly recommend combination therapies, especially fixed-dose combination gels including BPO in the aspects of pharmacological actions and compliance in the acute inflammatory phase to achieve earlier and better improvements. The 2017 GL also indicate to limit the antimicrobial treatments for the acute inflammatory phase up to approximately 3 months and recommend BPO, adapalene, and a fixed-dose combination gel of 0.1% adapalene and 2.5% BPO for the maintenance phase to avoid the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. The 2017 GL also discuss rosacea, which requires discrimination from acne and a different treatment plan.

### Topical treatments in acne vulgaris: guidance for the busy dermatologist [^1179QRFf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acne is a very common skin disease; frequently seen in adolescents and often persisting or occurring into adulthood. Topical therapy is very effective in mild to moderate disease, and is used as maintenance therapy. Fixed combination products have been studied in moderately severe disease. Combinations of benzoyl peroxide and either clindamycin or adapalene appear very effective. When utilizing a topical retinoid alone or in combination, it is essential to incorporate an appropriate skin care regimen to minimize local irritation. In the absence of direct comparative clinical trials, this review provides timely guidance for clinicians on the use of these agents, and their benefits in special populations.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^1158HTxH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition affecting approximately 95% of adolescents to some extent. First‐line treatments are topical preparations but nonadherence is common. A substantial proportion of patients take long courses of oral antibiotics, associated with antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

This study aimed to explore young people's views and experiences of acne and its treatments.

Methods

We report a secondary thematic analysis of interview data collected by researchers in the Health Experiences Research Group, University of Oxford. A total of 25 transcripts from young people aged 13–24 years with acne were included.

Results

Acne is often perceived as a short‐term self‐limiting condition of adolescence and this appears to have implications for seeking treatment or advice. Participants widely perceived topical treatments as being ineffective, which seemed related to unrealistic expectations around speed of onset of action. Many participants felt they had tried all available topical treatments, although were unsure what was in them or unaware of differences between cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments. They had concerns around how to use topicals 'properly' and how to avoid side‐effects. They were also concerned about the side‐effects or necessity of oral treatments, although few seemed aware of antibiotic resistance.

Conclusions

People with acne need support to manage their condition effectively, particularly a better understanding of different topicals, how to use them and how to avoid side‐effects. Unrealistic expectations about the onset of action of treatments appears to be a common cause of frustration and nonadherence. Directing people towards accessible evidence‐based information is crucial.

What's already known about this topic?

There is a common perception that acne is a short‐term condition that will resolve without treatment.
Previous research has shown that nonadherence to topical treatments is common and that oral antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for acne in the U.K.
Further research is needed to understand how young people perceive acne treatments and the implications of this for treatment adherence and self‐management.

What does this study add?

People often said they had tried all available topical preparations for acne, but seemed confused between cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments.
People seemed unsure how to use topical treatments 'properly' or how to avoid side‐effects. This was rarely discussed with health professionals.
People's perception of acne as a short‐term condition appeared to influence their expectations around onset of action of treatment and their views about its effectiveness and necessity.

What are the clinical implications of the work?

The perception of acne as a short‐term condition has implications for self‐management and motivation to seek and adhere to treatments.
Providing advice about onset of action of treatments and how to prevent side‐effects is crucial, including directing people towards accessible, written, evidence‐based information.
People's confusion about the different topical treatments available may be alleviated by such information, or by encouraging photos or other recordings of treatments tried and for how long.

### Adverse effects of acne medications: recognition and management [^114Tdqyp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. The clinical features of acne range from non-inflammatory comedones to inflammatory nodules. While often perceived as an adolescent disease, the prevalence remains high into adulthood, and the manifestations can have detrimental psychosocial effects. It is therefore not surprising that many patients are motivated to seek treatment. The existing treatment strategies for acne are complex due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. Although it is difficult to cure, four categories of medications have proved efficacious in reducing acne lesions: topical agents, systemic antibiotics, systemic retinoids, and hormonal agents. Unfortunately, these medications can cause adverse effects that may limit their use. Typically, these adverse effects are mild and transient and can be remedied by altering the dose or frequency of the offending agent. However, more serious adverse effects can occur that pose a significant health risk to the patient. Understanding how to recognize and manage the adverse effects of common acne therapies is imperative to providing the safest and most appropriate treatment for each patient. This article focuses on the recognition and management of adverse effects associated with current acne medications.

### Blue-light therapy for acne vulgaris: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114M7hDg]. Annals of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Antibiotic use in acne treatment raises concerns about increased resistance, necessitating alternatives. We assessed the effectiveness of blue-light therapy for acne.

Methods

We analyzed randomized controlled trials comparing blue light with nonlight interventions. Studies included people of any age, sex, and acne severity, in any setting, and reported on investigator-assessed change in acne severity, patients' assessment of improvement, change in inflammatory or noninflammatory lesions, and adverse events. Where data were sufficient, mean differences were calculated.

Results

Eighteen references (14 trials) including 698 participants were included. Most of the trials were small and short (< 12 weeks) and had high risk of bias. Investigator-assessed improvement was quantitatively reported in 5 trials, of which 3 reported significantly greater improvement in blue light than comparator, and 2 reported improvement. Patients' assessments of improvement were quantitatively reported by 2 trials, favoring blue light. Mean difference in the mean number of noninflammatory lesions was nonsignificant between groups at weeks 4, 8, and 10–12 and overall (mean difference [MD] = 3.47; 95% CI, -0.76 to 7.71; P = 0.11). Mean difference in the mean number of inflammatory lesions was likewise nonsignificant between groups at any of the time points and overall (MD = 0.16; 95% CI, -0.99 to 1.31; P = 0.78). Adverse events were generally mild and favored blue light or did not significantly differ between groups.

Conclusion

Methodological and reporting limitations of existing evidence limit conclusions about the effectiveness of blue light for acne. Clinicians and patients should therefore consider the balance between its benefits and adverse events, as well as costs.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115R7pf9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost‐effectiveness of treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision–analytical model compared costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta‐analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost‐effective. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost‐effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost‐effective for the management of acne. Well‐conducted studies are needed to examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Optimizing isotretinoin treatment of acne: update on current recommendations for monitoring, dosing, safety, adverse effects, compliance, and outcomes [^115UTVrt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by dermatologists. It can be severe and result in permanent scars. Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne and has the potential for long-term clearance. Prescribing and monitoring protocols can vary widely among prescribers. Recent studies, reports, and consensus statements help shed light on optimizing the use of isotretinoin for acne. A recent literature review is summarized in this article to help the practitioner optimize isotretinoin use for acne. The article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of standard, high-dose, and low-dose isotretinoin regimens; discusses the current status of controversies surrounding isotretinoin (including depression/suicide, pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease); reviews monitoring recommendations and treatment for hypertriglyceridemia and elevated transaminase levels; and discusses common adverse effects seen with isotretinoin, along with their treatment and prevention.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115SANvA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^113eHCtC]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^1148gW8P]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of model fit, inconsistency and bias

Model fit statistics suggested that there was insufficient information to differentiate effects across treatments within each class, therefore fixed class effects models were used across analyses (i.e. all treatments within each class were assumed to have equal effects). The selected study‐specific treatment effects models (fixed or random) for each analysis are reported in Appendix S11 (see Supporting Information). Although there were no meaningful differences between the selected consistency and inconsistency models (Appendix S11), some evidence of local‐level inconsistency was identified across all analyses (Appendix S12; see Supporting Information).

Of the 112 RCTs for mild‐to‐moderate acne, 52 were at high overall risk of bias, and for 60 RCTs there were some concerns about bias. Of the 67 RCTs for moderate‐to‐severe acne, 36 RCTs were at high overall risk of bias, and for 31 RCTs there were some concerns about bias (Appendix S13; see Supporting Information). Overall, the quality of included RCTs was judged to be moderate to very low.

Evidence of bias was identified in the following analyses (Appendix S14; see Supporting Information):
Mild‐to‐moderate acne, efficacy (%CFB): evidence of small‐study bias
Moderate‐to‐severe acne, discontinuation owing to side‐effects: evidence of bias in Domain 4 of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool [outcome measurement (efficacy)].

Thus, for these two analyses we considered results from bias‐adjusted models.

Transitivity and inconsistency checks

A basic NMA assumption is that the distribution of effect modifiers is the same across treatment comparisons ('transitivity' assumption). To control for potential effect modifiers, we aimed to reduce heterogeneity in populations and treatments across RCTs included in the NMAs. For this reason, we stratified analyses by acne severity, using clear criteria and excluding RCTs with populations of all severity levels or with unclear acne severity. Treatments such as hormonal contraceptives are relevant only to females, and thus analyses were conducted separately for males and females where appropriate. Treatments were assigned to treatment classes using detailed definitions, considering differentiation in dosing (e.g. oral isotretinoin, chemical peels vs. topical acids) and excluding treatments administered using suboptimal dosing. As age is a potential effect modifier, we reviewed the study samples' age ranges in the included RCTs. Other effect modifiers might be present in the dataset, but these were either unknown or could not be explored as they were not consistently reported (e.g. socioeconomic factors).

Violations of the transitivity assumption may lead to inconsistency, i.e. conflict between the direct and indirect evidence estimates of the same treatment comparisons. This was assessed statistically by undertaking global inconsistencyand node‐split tests. Details on inconsistency checking methods are provided in Appendix S4 (see Supporting Information).

Bias adjustment models

Bias adjustment models were fitted for all outcomes to downweight trials at high or unclear risk of bias (assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool)on domains where sufficient variability in ratings was observed across studies. Additional bias adjustment models tested for bias associated with small sample size studies. Analyses assumed possible bias in comparisons of active interventions vs. inactive control. In analyses where there was indication of the presence of such biases, results from bias‐adjusted models were considered. Details on bias adjustment methods and respective codes are shown in Appendix S5 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

Threshold analysis was undertaken on the efficacy outcome to assess the robustness of NMA‐based recommendations to potential biases or sampling variation in the included evidence. Results of threshold analysis describe how much each data point would have to change (e.g. if adjusted for bias) before the conclusion changes and what the revised conclusion would be. Appendix S6 (see Supporting Information) reports threshold analysis methods.

### An overview of treatment options for mild-to-moderate acne based on American Academy of Dermatology, European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, and Italian society of dermatology and venereology guidelines [^111VQ9Pb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne is a common inflammatory skin disorder affecting the pilosebaceous unit. Patients with mild-to-moderate acne can be treated with a combination of topical, systemic, and physical therapeutic approaches, with different results depending on patient, disease, and treatment characteristics. Herein we describe and discuss the common and alternative treatment options used for mild-to-moderate acne, by comparing three widely distributed guidelines (American Academy of Dermatology, European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, and Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology.
