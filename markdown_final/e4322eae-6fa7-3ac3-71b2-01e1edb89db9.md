## Question

A 38-year-old man with a 5-year history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) attends your hepatology clinic for routine follow-up. He has no history of fractures, does not smoke, and drinks alcohol occasionally. His current medications include ursodeoxycholic acid and vitamin D supplements. He reports no bone pain or mobility issues. His liver function tests are stable. There is no family history of osteoporosis. On review of his records, there is no documentation of any previous bone health assessment.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step regarding this patient's bone health?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step for bone health assessment in a 38-year-old man with a 5-year history of primary sclerosing cholangitis who has never had a bone health evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline fracture risk and why PSC mandates bone screening. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for timing and modality of bone density testing. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting screening intervals and thresholds. After that, I should consider whether any exceptions apply given his age and disease duration. Finally, I will outline immediate actions and follow-up plans, including supplementation and when to treat osteoporosis if found [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef] [^d79f9234].

> Let me first confirm the risk context. PSC is a cholestatic liver disease with a high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis and accelerated bone loss, and patients face a markedly increased fracture risk compared with matched populations, so I need to ensure we do not under-screen based on age alone [^4d34a8d2] [^83781304]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: a longitudinal PSC cohort showed osteoporosis in 15% with a 23.8-fold increased risk versus controls, and bone loss proceeds at about 1% per year, reinforcing the need for proactive screening even in younger adults with PSC [^4d34a8d2].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. The AASLD recommends obtaining bone density testing at diagnosis and repeating every 2–3 years based on risk factors, which supports screening even if the diagnosis was made years ago and never assessed, because baseline assessment is still indicated in all patients with PSC [^90ec2f62] [^f119d22a]. Hold on, I should verify consistency: EASL advises DEXA at diagnosis for all PSC patients, and BSG/UK-PSC recommends a risk assessment for osteoporosis in all PSC patients, aligning with universal screening rather than selective testing [^42fa60ef] [^d79f9234]. ACG similarly recommends DEXA at diagnosis and every 2–4 years thereafter, which corroborates the interval approach [^c2891676] [^39f6b47e].

> I will now examine the evidence supporting intervals. The 2–3 year cadence is grounded in observational data showing ongoing bone loss in PSC and the relatively rapid progression to osteopenia or osteoporosis in a meaningful subset, justifying periodic reassessment even when initial results are normal [^4d34a8d2]. Let me consider whether his current age changes this: although he is 38, PSC-specific risk is elevated independent of age, so the interval remains appropriate rather than extending it based on chronological age alone [^83781304].

> But wait, what if he already takes vitamin D — does that obviate screening? I should double-check: supplementation without documented sufficiency or baseline BMD does not substitute for screening, and guidelines still recommend DEXA to detect occult low BMD and to guide therapy intensity, so I should not defer testing solely because of empiric vitamin D use [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef]. I need to ensure we also address vitamin D status quantitatively, since deficiency is common in cholestatic disease and influences bone health decisions, but that complements rather than replaces BMD testing [^83781304].

> Next, I should review immediate actions. The most appropriate next step is to order a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan now to establish baseline bone mineral density, given the absence of any prior assessment, and then plan periodic reassessment every 2–3 years thereafter in line with AASLD and EASL guidance [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef]. Hold on, I should verify the modality: DEXA is the gold standard and should include lumbar spine and hip measurements to best estimate fracture risk and guide management thresholds [^828db4fa].

> I will now examine downstream management tied to results. If osteoporosis is identified, AASLD recommends vitamin D 2000 IU/day and calcium 1–1.5 g/day, plus bisphosphonate therapy, with oral agents favored when no varices are present and IV agents considered if varices are present to mitigate mucosal irritation and bleeding risk, which I should confirm and individualize based on endoscopic history [^bab72862]. If osteopenia is found, I should consider calcium and vitamin D optimization and reassess risk factors and fracture risk, recognizing that a T-score drop of 1 SD roughly doubles fracture risk in this population, which supports proactive treatment thresholds in PSC [^39f6b47e].

> Let me reconsider the timing one more time to avoid a mistake. Even though he is 5 years post-diagnosis, the absence of a baseline BMD means the correct course is to obtain DEXA now and then continue surveillance every 2–3 years going forward, rather than attempting to backdate the interval, because current guidance emphasizes establishing baseline and then periodic reassessment based on risk, not delaying screening due to disease duration [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with quality metrics and real-world care gaps, which consistently show under-assessment of bone health in cholestatic liver disease, underscoring the need to act now [^eb512ca2].

> Final recommendation: Order a DEXA scan now to establish baseline bone mineral density, then repeat every 2–3 years according to AASLD and EASL guidance, and concurrently evaluate vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D to guide supplementation, since this is the most evidence-aligned next step for a 38-year-old with PSC who has never had bone health assessment [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef] [^83781304].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **order a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan now** to assess bone mineral density, because patients with PSC have a high risk of osteoporosis even without symptoms [^4d34a8d2]. Current guidelines recommend **DEXA at diagnosis and every 2–3 years** thereafter, and this patient has never had a baseline assessment [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef]. If osteoporosis or osteopenia is found, initiate calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate therapy as indicated, with IV bisphosphonates preferred if varices are present [^bab72862].

---

## Prevalence and risk of osteoporosis in PSC

Osteoporosis is common in PSC, with a prevalence of about 15% and a risk up to 24-fold higher than age-matched controls [^4d34a8d2] [^83781304]. Risk factors include **older age, low BMI, and long-standing IBD** [^4d34a8d2]. Importantly, osteoporosis can occur even in younger patients and in the absence of cirrhosis, so age alone does not exclude risk [^notfound].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Several authoritative guidelines provide clear recommendations on bone health assessment in PSC:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AASLD 2023 | - Obtain bone density testing at diagnosis <br/> - Repeat every 2–3 years based on risk factors [^90ec2f62] [^f119d22a] |
| EASL 2022 | - Obtain DEXA at diagnosis in all patients with PSC <br/> - Follow evidence-based guidelines for monitoring and treatment [^42fa60ef] |
| BSG 2019 | - Perform osteoporosis risk assessment in all patients with PSC <br/> - Treat and follow-up according to national guidelines if osteoporosis is detected [^d79f9234] |

---

Given these guidelines, the most appropriate next step is to **perform a DEXA scan now** to establish a baseline and guide future monitoring [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef].

---

## Rationale for immediate DEXA scanning

Immediate DEXA scanning is indicated because:

- **High risk**: PSC carries a significant risk of osteoporosis even in younger patients and those without cirrhosis [^4d34a8d2] [^83781304].
- **Baseline establishment**: A baseline DEXA is essential to detect existing bone loss and to guide subsequent monitoring and treatment [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef].
- **Absence of symptoms**: Osteoporosis is often asymptomatic until fracture occurs, so clinical assessment alone is insufficient [^notfound].

---

## Management based on DEXA results

Management should be tailored to the **DEXA findings**:

- **Normal BMD**: Continue vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle measures; repeat DEXA in 2–3 years [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef].
- **Osteopenia**: Initiate calcium (1–1.5 g/day) and vitamin D (1000–2000 IU/day); consider bisphosphonates if additional risk factors are present [^bab72862].
- **Osteoporosis**: Initiate calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate therapy; IV bisphosphonates are preferred if esophageal varices are present [^bab72862].

---

## Additional considerations

- **Vitamin D status**: Assess and correct vitamin D deficiency, as it is common in cholestatic liver disease and contributes to bone loss [^83781304] [^a5b04c3d].
- **Lifestyle measures**: Encourage weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol intake to reduce fracture risk [^5a206c21].
- **Monitoring**: Repeat DEXA every 2–3 years, or sooner if risk factors change or if osteoporosis treatment is initiated [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **order a DEXA scan now** to assess bone mineral density, given the high risk of osteoporosis in PSC and the absence of a baseline assessment. This aligns with current AASLD and EASL guidelines and will inform timely intervention if bone loss is detected [^90ec2f62] [^42fa60ef].

Guidance statements in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)—bile acid sequestrants should be used as initial therapy for patients with PSC who have pruritus that does not respond to conservative measures such as heat avoidance, emollients, and antihistamines; alternatives for refractory pruritus include sertraline 100 mg daily, naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50–100 mg daily, and rifampin 150–300 mg twice daily. Nutritional assessments, including but not limited to biometrics and lipid-soluble vitamin levels, should be performed at PSC diagnosis and yearly thereafter with nutritional intervention and vitamin supplementation as needed. Bone density examinations should be performed to exclude osteopenia or osteoporosis at diagnosis and at 2-year to 3-year intervals thereafter based on risk factors.

Primary biliary cholangitis—bone health, screening, and supplementation: Baseline and regular screening every 2 years using bone mineral density testing is appropriate, and daily calcium (1,500 mg/day) and vitamin D supplements (1,000 International Units/day) may be advisable if there is no history of renal stones; vitamin D levels should be measured annually in patients with advanced disease. In osteoporosis, alendronate was shown in a randomized controlled trial to significantly improve bone density compared with placebo, whereas etidronate was ineffective and monthly ibandronate was found comparable to weekly alendronate in safety and efficiency; hormone replacement therapy has led to some improvement but is seldom used because of safety concerns. Patients with PBC should be provided 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium and 1,000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed.

Nutrition and mineral bone disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)—patients with early PSC have reported deficiencies of vitamins A, D, and E at rates of 40%, 14%, and 2%, respectively; among those with advanced disease the rates were 82%, 57%, and 43%, respectively, and vitamins A, D, and E should be measured and supplemented as needed. In a 2011 single-center longitudinal cohort of 237 patients with PSC, osteoporosis was identified in 15%, with a 2.3- to 8-fold increased risk compared to population controls; multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 54, body mass index < 24 kg/m^2, and IBD for ≥ 19 years correlating with osteoporosis. In contrast, a recent study of 238 patients with PSC found no correlation between osteoporosis and age, disease duration, or severity of disease but rather a correlation between bone mineral density and bone resorption and T helper 17–cell frequency. All patients with PSC should be screened for metabolic bone disease by bone density measurement at diagnosis and then every 2–3 years in those with normal bone mineral density.

Service standards/audit recommendations for PBC

Opportunities exist to implement the BSG/UK-PBC PBC guidelines into clinical practice through audit of current and future clinical care. We propose that the following service standards and targets be adopted by clinical teams caring for patients with PBC, with the goal being improved and more effective and uniform care for patients with PBC:
To exclude alternative aetiologies for cholestasis, all patients with suspected PBC should have an abdominal ultrasound as part of their baseline assessment (standard 90%).
All patients should be offered therapy with UDCA. UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg/day is recommended for first-line use in all patients with PBC (standard 90% of patients receiving therapy at adequate dose or documented to be intolerant).
To facilitate the identification of patients at risk of progressive disease, individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices is recommended following 1 year of UDCA therapy (standard 80% of patients receiving UDCA therapy to have their response status recorded in the notes and the criteria used recorded).
To highlight the impact on QoL and to ensure appropriate investigation and treatment, all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch (standard 90% of patients have the presence/absence of fatigue and pruritus recorded in the notes in the last year).
To maximise the opportunity for all patients to be considered in a timely way for liver transplantation, all patients with a bilirubin >50 µmol/L or evidence of decompensated liver disease should be discussed with a hepatologist linked to a transplant programme (; s tandard 90 % documentation that discussion has taken place within 3 months of the bilirubin exceeding 50 µmol/ L and the actions taken recorded)
To optimise prevention of osteoporotic bone fractures, all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines (standard 80% assessment within the last 5 years).
To ensure timely but considered diagnosis and treatment, overlap with AIH should be recognised as rare and, when suspected, liver biopsy with expert clinicopathological assessment is recommended to make the diagnosis (standard 90% of patients in whom the diagnosis of overlap is made having had liver biopsy confirmation and the clinicopathological assessment discussion noted).

Recommendation 32

We recommend that all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines. (Strong; High)

When should patients be considered for clinical trials?

For many years following the original UDCA trials there has been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need in the condition,with progress to new licensed second-line therapies such as OCA,which has FDA and EMA approval, as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see).

High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease

The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process—namely, the upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury (typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA response criteria at the end of 1 year of treatment at 13–15 mg/kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.

Pruritus resistant to current therapy

Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) following first and established second-line therapy or who are intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.

Fatigue

Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature of the clinical problem.They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in these guidelines should be followed before trial participation is considered.

Cirrhosis, portal hypertension and liver failure

In an observational series of 174 patients with PSC who underwent a liver biopsy, advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis was found in 43% of patients with asymptomatic disease, and in 69% of those who were symptomatic; 25% died of liver failure. Other studies have shown similar results.It is likely that these series are subject to referral bias with patients at a more advanced stage than many patients routinely followed up in local centres, but they indicate a high prevalence of advanced parenchymal liver disease in PSC. The true prevalence of portal hypertension is not known, but extrapolating data from clinical findings, such as the presence of splenomegaly and oesophageal varices, suggests that clinically significant portal hypertension is present in 30%.

Metabolic bone disease

As with other cholestatic liver diseases, osteopenia and osteoporosis are common in PSC.In a study of 237 patients who underwent annual measurement of bone mineral density, 15% had evidence of osteoporosis, equating to a 24-fold risk of osteoporosis compared with an age-matched population.In this study, the presence of older age (>54 years), low body mass index (<24 kg/m 2) and presence of IBD were strong risk factors of low bone density (prevalence of 75% with all three risk factors and 3% with none), but interestingly, cumulative dose of corticosteroids was not. Patients may also have coexistent vitamin D deficiency, but overt osteomalacia is uncommon. UK guidelines on the management of osteoporosis associated with chronic liver disease advise that all patients should receive lifestyle advice and those with cirrhosis or advanced cholestasis should have bone densitometry performed every 2 years.In practice, young patients with early disease are at low risk of low bone density and will not usually require formal testing. Patients with a high risk of bone disease and those requiring steroid treatment for IBD or liver transplantation should be treated with daily vitamin D 400 IU (10 μg) and calcium supplements if calculated dietary calcium intake is insufficient. Those with confirmed osteoporosis should be treated according to BSG and NICE guidelines and fracture risk scores.

Recommendation 19 : We recommend that all patients with PSC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Once osteoporosis is detected, treatment and follow-up should be in accordance with national guidelines (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis [^0b1d6232]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. An estimated 80% of patients in North America and Europe have coexistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The underlying pathophysiology of PSC remains poorly understood. As a result, there is currently no effective medical therapy to halt disease progression. Important complications from PSC include metabolic bone disease, colorectal neoplasia, and cholangiocarcinoma. Liver transplantation remains the only successful treatment option for patients with advanced liver disease from PSC. A diagnosis of PSC should be considered among individuals with IBD and elevated serum liver biochemical tests.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score,the UK-PSC score,and the PREsTO score.However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature.In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown.Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies.Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

ACG Clinical Guideline—primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) introduction and definition: PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver and biliary tract disease with a highly variable natural history that can shorten life and may require liver transplantation, and the cause is unknown although it is commonly associated with colitis. Diagnosis is most frequently established using magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP), although direct cholangiography may be more sensitive, and typical cholangiographic findings include focal stricturing and saccular dilatation of the bile ducts leading to a “beaded” appearance. The differential diagnosis includes several disorders that lead to biliary strictures such as bacterial cholangitis, intraarterial administration of floxuridine, prior biliary surgery, and AIDSrelated cholangiopathy. PSC is an idiopathic condition defined by beading and stricture formation of the intra and/or extrahepatic bile ducts that cannot be ascribed to another cause, differentiating it from secondary sclerosing cholangitis. There is no approved or proven therapy; ursodeoxycholic acid is used by many on an empiric basis. Complications can include portal hypertension, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, metabolic bone diseases, and development of cancers of the bile duct or colon. Patients may be asymptomatic for long periods but may also have an aggressive course with recurrent biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis and may progress to end-stage liver disease.

Executive summary

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease. It continues to have a burden of morbidity and mortality that spans both the consequences of a sometimes progressive biliary injury, alongside a symptom profile notably encompassing pruritus, sicca complex, fatigue, abdominal discomfort and arthralgias/bone pain. UK-PBC and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) have partnered to develop a comprehensive guideline document to provide detailed advice and recommendations on the best approaches to the management of the disease. A series of recommendations and audit standards are proposed to ensure that patients are offered timely licensed therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), obeticholic acid (OCA)) in addition to being actively managed for symptoms as well as complications of progressive liver disease.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) tolerability and adjunctive considerations note minimal side effects and general tolerability, with a 5-pound weight gain over the first year reported and not progressive; loose stools and/or thinning of the hair have also been reported infrequently. For suboptimal response, issues of adherence, superimposed liver disease including fatty liver, and coadministration with bile sequestrants such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam should be considered. UDCA use has been associated with reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a reduced risk of developing varices, and slower histologic progression, but it does not improve fatigue, pruritus, associated bone disease, or autoimmune features found in association with primary biliary cholangitis.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)—Complications—If left untreated, PBC patients with persistent cholestasis will eventually progress to the advanced stage with complications associated with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis. Hyperlipidemia is common and can cause xanthelasmas and xanthomas, and it seems not to confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. PBC patients are more inclined to have hepatic osteodystrophy, with osteoporosis affecting around 20–44% of the patients. Signs of portal hypertension can develop before cirrhosis and are presinusoidal in nature, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma increases, especially in men or those with advanced diseases.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis affects 20–44% of patients with PBC with the resultant risk of fragility fractures, while the majority of patients have osteopenia.Risk factors for osteopenic bone disease in PBC include female gender, menopausal status, low body mass index (through the effects of disordered bile acid homeostasis and the pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with PBC), older age, advanced disease and chronic cholestasis with resultant vitamin D deficiency.Patients with PBC also have higher markers of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline) and lower markers of bone formation (osteocalcin).

Patients should be given general lifestyle advice to prevent loss of bone density (weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, minimising alcohol intake, etc). Falls are seen with increased frequency in PBC due to associated autonomic dysfunction and add to the increased fracture risk presented by osteoporosis.Patients with a clinical history of falls should be referred to a specialist falls clinic for multidisciplinary assessment, including for the presence of autonomic dysfunction.

All patients with cirrhosis and those with other recognised risk factors (eg, female gender, post-menopausal women, low body mass index, older age) should be assessed for osteoporosis and fracture risk. The FRAX score (the WHO fracture risk assessment tool can be used with or without bone mineral density (BMD) values) or QFracture (BMD values cannot be incorporated into the risk algorithm) should be used to estimate 10-year predicted absolute fracture risk. Following risk assessment with FRAX (without a BMD value) or QFracture, consider measuring BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in people whose fracture risk is in the region of an intervention threshold and recalculate absolute risk using FRAX with the BMD value.

National guidelines should be referred to for treatment algorithms.Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected and an adequate dietary intake assured. The use of calcium alongside vitamin D supplementation depends on the adequacy of dietary intake. If a bisphosphonate is required, alendronic acid is usually used first line.Specialist referral should be considered for patients who are unable to tolerate alendronate or risedronate. Treatment options include strontium ranelate, raloxifene, denosumab and teriparatide. There is a widely held view that oral bisphosphonates are unsafe in patients with varices because of the risk of superficial erosion and enhanced bleeding risk. The evidence to support this view is limited. Intravenous bisphosphonates can be used if there is clinical concern. There are limited data regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy and its efficacy in osteoporosis prevention in PBC.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^5f633a22]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease characterised by destruction of intrahepatic cholangiocytes and progressive fibrosis.The chronic disease course culminates in end-stage biliary cirrhosis and its associated complications such as portal hypertension.The UK prevalence of PBC is estimated to be 15 000.

Clinical features and the impact of PBC on the quality of life (QoL) are highly variable.Common features include pruritus, fatigue, memory problems and decreased bone mineral density.The aims of life-long treatment are to minimise the symptom burden, slow down disease progression and manage complications.Individuals with inadequate biochemical response to first-line therapy, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), following 1 year of treatment, are regarded as high risk of progressive disease.

Updated guidelines for PBC management were published in 2017 by European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and in 2018 by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) in collaboration with UK-PBC—both recommend the utilisation of audit tools.At the time of writing, no formal analysis has been undertaken on the management of PBC nationally.

This pilot audit aims to gain insight into the performance within the UK National Health Service (NHS). We aim to identify whether key targets are being met on an individual and national level.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but reports and expert review articles are also utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision of analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each guideline will be reviewed at an established time and indicated at publication to assure continued validity.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)—vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis guidance addresses screening, supplementation, and pharmacotherapy. EASL nutritional guidelines recommend supplement vitamin D orally in cirrhotic patients with vitamin D levels <20 ng/ ml, to reach serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) ≥ 30 ng/ml, and for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women sufficient calcium (1000–1500 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU/day) in the diet or as supplements are recommended if they have no history of renal stones. It is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for serum vitamin D status and it is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women. The risk fracture in PBC patients is two times higher than that in the health population, and supplements of calcium and vitamin D are recommended with particular care in patients with a history of renal stones. Bisphosphonates are generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects including gastroesophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain, and atrial fibrillation, and are not recommended for people with severe impairment of renal function or hypocalcemia; people with specific problems of the esophagus may not be able to take the oral tablets. Evidence for fracture prevention includes a recent randomized clinical trial showing that either weekly alendronate or monthly ibandronate treatment could improve bone mass in patients with PBC; however, hormone replacement therapy in women with PBC is not supported by reliable evidence, and a report confirmed the efficacy and safety of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, for osteoporosis in patients with PBC.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis-a comprehensive review [^751a84ef]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary sclerosing cholangitis: 
- Definition: PSC is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive biliary inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in multifocal biliary strictures.
- Pathophysiology: Risk factors include family history, genetic susceptibility (HLA class, I, II, and III loci, IL-2 pathway), environmental factors (exposure to farm animals, contraceptive pills, UTIs, diet), and microbial dysbiosis due to IBD.
- Epidemiology: The incidence and prevalence of PSC is estimated at 0-0.92 per 100,000 person-years, and 0-13.6 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- Disease course: Injury to cholangiocytes leads to biliary inflammation and fibrosis, which may further progress to chronic cholestasis, liver cirrhosis, bile duct strictures, bacterial cholangitis, metabolic bone disease, colon cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: PSC is associated with increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (400 times) and colon cancer (10 times) as compared to the general population.

### Osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^828db4fa]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Metabolic bone disease has been recognized as an important complication of chronic liver disease particularly in cholestatic disorders [primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis] and after liver transplantation. It includes osteoporosis and more rarely osteomalacia, which is more frequent in severe malabsorption and advanced liver disease. The pathogenesis of this disorder is complex and is likely to be multifactorial. Regardless of the etiology of osteoporosis in PBC patients, they have an increased risk of spontaneous or low-trauma fracturing leading to significant patient morbidity, deterioration of quality of life, and even patient mortality. The development of bone densitometry has allowed assessment of bone mass and then contributed in estimating the fracture risk. The gold standard of bone mineral density measurement is currently the dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Recommendations formulated by the World Health Organization have reported the diagnostic ranges of osteoporosis based on the t-score: patient with osteoporosis has a t-score less than -2.5 SD, osteopenia has a t-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD and a normal individual has a t-score more than -1.0 SD. The risk of fracture shows a correlation with bone mineral density but no fracture threshold was determined and the best site of characterizing the hip fracture risk is the measure of the bone mineral density of the proximal femur. The treatment of osteoporosis in patients with PBC is largely based on trials of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis as there are a few and smaller studies of osteoporotic patients with PBC. Bisphosphonates seem to be effective in biliary disease and are more tolerated.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^eb512ca2]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive, autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease affecting approximately 15000 individuals in the UK. Updated guidelines for the management of PBC were published by The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in 2017. We report on the first national, pilot audit that assesses the quality of care and adherence to guidelines.

Design

Data were collected from 11 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland between 2017 and 2020. Data on patient demographics, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dosing and key guideline recommendations were captured from medical records. Results from each hospital were evaluated for target achievement and underwent χ 2 analysis for variation in performance between trusts.

Results

790 patients' medical records were reviewed. The data demonstrated that the majority of hospitals did not meet all of the recommended EASL standards. Standards with the lowest likelihood of being met were identified as optimal UDCA dosing, assessment of bone density and assessment of clinical symptoms (pruritus and fatigue). Significant variations in meeting these three standards were observed across UK, in addition to assessment of biochemical response to UDCA (all p<0.0001) and assessment of transplant eligibility in high-risk patients (p=0.0297).

Conclusion

Our findings identify a broad-based deficiency in 'real-world' PBC care, suggesting the need for an intervention to improve guideline adherence, ultimately improving patient outcomes. We developed the PBC Review tool and recommend its incorporation into clinical practice. As the first audit of its kind, it will be used to inform a future wide-scale reaudit.

### Bone disease in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^4d34a8d2]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Osteopenic bone disease occurs frequently among patients with chronic liver disease but has not been well studied in those with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We investigated the prevalence, rate of progression, and independent predictors of bone disease in a large number of patients with all stages of PSC.

Methods

Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, hip, and total body was measured yearly for 10 years in 237 patients with PSC.

Results

Osteoporosis (T-score less than -2.5) was found in 15% of patients and occurred 23.8-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-122.8) more frequently in those with PSC than expected from a matched population. By multivariate analysis, age 54 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 7.8; 95% CI, 3.3-18.3), body mass index ≤ 24 kg/m(2) (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.9-12.6), and inflammatory bowel disease for ≥ 19 years (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4) correlated with the presence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was present in 75% of patients with all 3 risk factors but in only 3.1% of those without all of them. Patients with PSC lost 1% of bone mass per year; this rate of bone loss was significantly associated with duration of inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusions

Osteoporosis occurs frequently among patients with PSC. Old age, low body mass index, and long duration of inflammatory bowel disease can be used to identify patients with PSC who might derive the most benefit from measurements of bone density and treatments for bone diseases.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis—imaging evaluation: Imaging of the biliary tract is emphasized as the most important initial step, with cross-sectional ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging performed in patients with persistent cholestatic liver tests to exclude obstruction; if obstruction is not found, cholangiography is the next step, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has rapidly supplanted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as the preferred cholangiography for suspected PSC because MRCP is noninvasive, less expensive than ERCP, and has no associated risk of pancreatitis, although it does not allow brush cytology/biopsy or therapeutic interventions for mechanical obstruction.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) cancer surveillance—Annual colon surveillance preferably with chromoendoscopy is recommended in PSC patients with colitis beginning at the time of PSC diagnosis, and a full colonoscopy with biopsies is recommended in patients with PSC regardless of the presence of symptoms to assess for associated colitis at the time of PSC diagnosis. Some advocate repeating the exam every 3–5 years in those without prior evidence of colitis. Consider screening for cholangiocarcinoma with regular cross-sectional imaging with ultrasound or MR and serial CA 19-9 every 6–12 months, and cholecystectomy should be performed for patients with PSC and gallbladder polyps >8 mm, to prevent the development of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.

New British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PSC guidelines have recently discussed the current state-of-the-art on primary sclerosing cholangitis and outlined key elements for the management of this disease. The current lack of effective pharmacological treatments to prevent progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis limits our ability to modify the natural history of the disease. However, a personalised approach and structured follow-up could allow earlier diagnosis and management of complications and favour access to liver transplantation, which remains the only available treatment. Our commentary overviews the updates and summarises the key recommendations of the recent guidelines for the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

### Development of a question prompt list for people living with primary biliary cholangitis: a Delphi study [^bc65c038]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Clinical practice guidelines support caregivers to manage liver diseases. However, people with lifelong conditions often lack guidance to understand what aspects of care are most important and how their disease should be managed. This study aimed to create a question prompt list (QPL) for individuals with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) including key questions (directed) to their treating physician that are most likely to improve their outcome.

Methods

International PBC professionals including patient representatives rated and ranked questions related to 9 aspects of PBC care. Questions rated by >70% as moderately/very important were considered best candidate questions (BCQs) for the QPL. Results of the survey were discussed during 2 in-person meetings, upon which the questions and/or QPL were amended.

Results

Based on 108 respondents, 11 of 43 questions were considered BCQs. After 2 in-person meetings (64 attendees), the final QPL contained 8 questions and was unanimously approved by 19 members of the study team during the consensus meeting. The included questions referred to the risk of disease progression, presence of cirrhosis, need of second-line therapy, need of repeated liver stiffness measurements, bone health, and availability of patient information and support. Two BCQs addressing options to manage pruritus and fatigue were combined on the QPL. In addition, one question regarding first-line therapy was included despite being rated as moderately/very important by 68.5%.

Conclusions

The PBC patient question prompt list serves as a user-facing document, to enhance the patient experience, and drive value-based healthcare in routine clinical practice.

LEARNING EXPERIENCES FROM SELECTED CLINICAL TRIALS IN PSC

Ursodeoxycolic acid

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid with a potential beneficial impact on cholestatic liver disease, which is only partially understood.While considered standard of care in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), robust and trial-based evidence for an impact on clinical outcomes from UDCA in PSC is still missing,and population-based registry data also remain conflicting as to a potential clinical benefit.

The history of clinical trials on UDCA in PSC holds several learning experiences. The largest randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial involving UDCA in PSC to date included 218 adults with PSC who were randomized to receive UDCA 17–23 mg/kg per day (mg/kg/d) or placebo with a median follow-up of 38–42 months.Results of the trial illustrate the status of UDCA in PSC; there was a tendency for improvement in ALT and ALP levels during the first 6 months; however, no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes, symptoms, or quality of life was shown between the treatment and placebo arm. The study, however, failed to recruit the 346 participants needed to detect a predefined 50% reduction of primary events (death or liver transplantation) during the 5-year period of treatment, exemplifying also the logistical and practical challenges of clinical trials in a rare disease like PSC. In an extended follow-up analysis of 198 participants from the trial, normal ALP or ALP reductions >40% were reported to associate favorably with long-term clinical outcomes in PSC,however with no evidence for such favorable outcomes to result from UDCA prescription; in fact, the best survival rate was found in participants with an ALP reduction assigned to placebo.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^58551f79]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Risk-stratified initiation and interval guidance for colorectal cancer surveillance in IBD indicates that prior guidelines recommended initiating screening at 8 to 10 years after symptom onset or 15 years for isolated left-sided disease, whereas recent guidelines recommend initiating screening no later than 8 years after symptom onset and sooner for primary sclerosing cholangitis or a strong family history of CRC (first-degree relative diagnosed before age 50). Screening colonoscopy is recommended even in prior isolated proctitis, and it is reasonable to obtain biopsy specimens of the proximal colon to exclude microscopic extension; surveillance should be offered to UC with endoscopic or histologic inflammation within and proximal to the sigmoid colon and to CD with more than one third of colon involvement, and whenever possible surveillance should be undertaken when colitis is in remission. Two current U.S. guidelines recommend colonoscopy surveillance every 1 to 2 years or 1 to 3 years; the highest risk patients, defined by active extensive disease, prior dysplasia or stricture, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or family history of CRC in a first-degree relative aged < 50 years, should undergo annual surveillance, whereas patients in endoscopic and histologic remission without neoplasia or family history of CRC are considered lower risk and can be surveyed at longer intervals.

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology liver section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies which may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. Quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care as we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centred considerations.

### Cholangiocarcinoma: natural history, treatment, and strategies for surveillance in high-risk patients [^bd214d55]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a primary malignancy of biliary epithelium. Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis and other conditions that produce chronic inflammation of the biliary tree. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can be elusive; it is often not made until advanced disease is present and at a stage when a curative surgical resection is not feasible. Currently used diagnostic modalities include serum and bile tumor markers, radiologic and endoscopic imaging, and pathologic analysis. Surveillance strategies to increase the chance of early diagnosis should be strongly considered in individuals at high risk for cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with long-standing primary sclerosing cholangitis would be the ideal candidates for a screening program.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^fce34d8c]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance—primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) management: All patients with PSC should be considered for participation in clinical trials. In patients not eligible or interested in clinical trials with persistently elevated ALP or GGT, UDCA 13–23 mg/kg/day can be considered for treatment and continued if there is a meaningful reduction or normalization in ALP (GGT in children) and/or symptoms improve with 12 months of treatment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of PSC. Patients with PSC with a diagnosis of concurrent AIH should be treated according to the AASLD AIH guidelines. Antibiotics should be used for bacterial cholangitis with consideration for MRCP to rule out relevant strictures. ERCP should be preferred for the treatment of dominant strictures with careful patient selection and assessment of risks versus benefits and alternatives. Antibiotics should be administered periprocedurally. Upper endoscopy to screen for varices should be performed if the LS is > 20 kPa by TE or the platelet count is ≤ 150,000/mm3.

### Recent developments in the management of idiopathic cholestatic liver disease [^62ea4556]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Patient, graft, and recurrence-free survival rates were 78%, 74%, and 57% at 5 years post living donor liver transplantation. Based on a multivariate analysis, MELD scores >24, first-degree related donors, cytomegalovirus antigenemia within 3 months, and biliary anastomotic complications within 1 year were found to be risk factor for recurrence. Risk factors for graft loss included MELD scores >24 and first-degree related donors. Recurrence was also found to be a risk factor for graft loss, but not for patient death. The authors suggest that first degree relative donors should be avoided. They also suggest earlier referral to transplantation centers, cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, and efforts to decrease biliary anastomotic complications.

Liver transplantation in chronic liver disease

Liver transplantation is valuable therapeutic option in patients with chronic liver disease especially in patients reaching end stage disease or suffering decompensation. Two scores are of crucial importance in the process of referring patients to the liver transplantation service, the MELD and the Mayo risk scores. The MELD score is of central importance and is used to prioritize patients for referral whereas the Mayo risk score aims to predict outcomes.

Other indications for referral can include quality of life issues such as intractable ascites, severe encephalopathy, intractable pruritus, severe osteoporosis, and recurrent biliary tree infections. Specific indications for liver transplantation are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 
Specific indications for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis

Bone density should be measured in all PSC patients upon diagnosis

Specialist referral

We suggest that care provision should involve a partnership between patients, primary care and hospital-led specialty medicine. Care delivery for an individual patient should encompass patient risk assessment, symptom burden and how local services are configured. All patients should have at least an annual review, which should become more frequent as required if symptoms or complications develop. The timing of referral to specialist regional HPB units will vary and depend on physicians’ experience in caring for patients with PSC, and in biliary intervention. In practice, referral will be at the point where a patient’s clinical management is beyond both the local expertise and knowledge of their responsible physician and team. As a general rule, all symptomatic patients should be under the care of a specialist clinician or HPB centre with an interest and experience in managing PSC. In the absence of effective medical treatment and with the unpredictable natural history of PSC, it is important that patients are referred early for consideration of liver transplantation. Patients with jaundice from suspected parenchymal disease, rising liver disease scores (MELD >11, UKELD >46) or complicated biliary strictures, require discussion with specialist units for consideration of endoscopic, radiological and/or surgical biliary intervention or liver transplantation. Other reasons to consider referral include persistently raised ALP levels,transient elastography of >9.9 kPaor an enhanced liver fibrosis test result of >10.6.Patients with early, asymptomatic, stable disease can usually be managed by non-specialist gastroenterologists or other clinicians with adherence to management guidelines. Centres with a particular interest in PSC may be undertaking clinical trials, and patients should be offered the chance to enter into such trials. All patients with suspected CCA or other malignancies should be referred to the appropriate regional multidisciplinary cancer meeting for review.

Recommendation 15 : We suggest that provision of care should involve a partnership between patients, primary care and hospital-led specialty medicine with consideration made with regard to patient risk assessment, symptom burden and how local services are configured (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).

Recommendation 16 : We recommend that patients with symptomatic, evolving or complex disease should be referred for expert multidisciplinary assessment. Patients with early, stable disease can be managed in general clinics (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).

Recommendation 17 : We suggest that patients with PSC meeting inclusion criteria should be offered referral to a centre participating in clinical trials (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).

Executive summary and recommendations

There are many causes of cholangiopathy and these should be considered in the assessment of all patients presenting with biliary strictures. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has a wide spectrum of symptomatology and stages of disease. Diagnosis is based on the cholangiographic (or histological) features of sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of identifiable causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis. The diagnosis and management of PSC can be difficult and requires specialist referral for advanced disease or patients experiencing significant clinical events. Few randomised controlled trials have been carried out to define best management. Most recommendations derive from small case –control studies, retrospective series and expert opinion. There is little evidence for the use of medical therapy to prevent progression of disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid is not recommended for routine use in newly diagnosed PSC. Non-invasive investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), dynamic liver MRI and/or contrast CT should be performed in patients who have new or changing symptoms or evolving abnormalities in laboratory investigations. Worsening liver biochemistry and/or new high grade or evolving strictures should prompt further investigation for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Patients with PSC should ordinarily not undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) until there has been expert multidisciplinary assessment to justify endoscopic intervention. Colitis should be sought in all patients with PSC using colonoscopy and colonic biopsies. Patients with colitis should then have annual surveillance colonoscopy because of the increased risk of colorectal cancer. In these guidelines, we also review the management of PSC overlap syndromes and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC).

Obeticholic Acid in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding evaluation of the efficacy and safety of OCA in participants with PSC. Approximately 75 participants who provided written informed consent and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:

1. 5 milligrams titrating to 3 mg OCA, 5 mg titrating to 10 mg OCA, or placebo, in a 1: 1: 1 ratio. Participants self-administered investigational product orally, once daily for 2 consecutive 12-week periods. For the first 12 weeks, the participant's dose was 1. 5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo. After 12 weeks, the participant's dose was titrated as follows, providing there were no limiting safety or tolerability concerns in the opinion of the Investigator, while maintaining the trial blind: the 1.

5 mg OCA treatment group titrated to 3 mg, the 5 mg OCA treatment group titrated to 10 mg OCA, and the placebo group remained on placebo. Double-blind treatment continued for a further 12 weeks at that dose. Any participant whose dose was not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, remained on their starting treatment for the remainder of the DB phase to Week 24. Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of concomitant ursodeoxycholic acid use and total bilirubin level. Following completion of the DB phase, participants were asked to reconfirm their consent for participation in the open-label LTSE phase. Drug: Obeticholic Acid Drug: Placebo

- 2014-002205-38
- 2014-002205-38.

For participants with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease:
- Colonoscopy or other appropriate endoscopic procedure within 12 months of Day 0 confirming no dysplasia or colorectal cancer
- Participants with Crohn's Disease must have been in remission as defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index <150.
- Participants with ulcerative colitis must either have been in remission or have had mild disease. Remission was defined as a partial Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual sub-score exceeding 1. Mild disease was defined as a partial Mayo score ≤3 with no individual sub-score exceeding 1 point.
- For participants being administered UDCA as part of their standard of care, the dose must have been stable for ≥3 months prior to, and including, Day 0 and must not have exceeded 20 mg/kilograms/day during this time.
- Participants being administered biologic treatments, immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, or statins, must have been on a stable dose for ≥3 months prior to, and including, Day 0 and should plan to remain on a stable dose throughout the trial. Presence of clinical complications of chronic liver disease or clinically significant hepatic decompensation, including:
- Current Child Pugh classification B or C
- History of, or current diagnosis or suspicion of, cholangiocarcinoma or other hepatobiliary malignancy, or biliary tract dysplasia.
- History of liver transplantation, or current model of end stage liver disease score ≥12

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease [^fc8ddc14]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare pathology seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis. PSC increases patients' morbidity and requires the attention of a multidisciplinary team as those patients require frequent colonoscopies and biopsies due to the elevated risk of malignancy, biliary screening and management of progressive disease that could leave patients in liver failure requiring liver transplant. Some consider this a separate form of IBD in addition to Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. These patients should be monitored closely and managed carefully due to implications of ongoing management on quality of life and survival.
