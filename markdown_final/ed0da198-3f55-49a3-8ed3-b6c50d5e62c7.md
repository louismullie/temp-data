## Question

What is thé cutoff for Hb?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the hemoglobin cutoff is, including how it varies across populations and contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical WHO thresholds and their limitations. Then, I should verify the most recent multinational evidence proposing updated statistical thresholds. Next, I will examine pregnancy-specific and pediatric considerations, followed by transfusion thresholds in adults and special populations. After that, I need to review CKD-specific targets and monitoring. Finally, I should integrate altitude, smoking, and ancestry adjustments, and synthesize practical clinical implications and uncertainties that remain.

> Let me first confirm the historical WHO cutoffs and why they are being questioned. The WHO anemia thresholds — 13.0 g/dL for adult men, 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant adult women, 11.0 g/dL for children 6–59 months, and 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester, 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester, and 11.0 g/dL in the third trimester for pregnancy — were derived in the 1960s from limited, predominantly European and North American populations and have remained largely unchanged since, raising concerns about global applicability and linkage to outcomes [^1122Vp8f] [^116q5b2E] [^111sujdV] [^113D8qwA].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the discrepancy with newer data. Large multinational analyses using rigorously defined healthy reference populations show that the fifth percentile of hemoglobin is substantially lower than WHO thresholds in most settings: approximately 9.65 g/dL for children 6–59 months and 10.81 g/dL for nonpregnant women 15–49 years, suggesting WHO cutoffs are about 1.35 g/dL and 1.19 g/dL too high, respectively, for these groups [^116cVcA4] [^111hLzUE]. Hold on, I should also check the broader lifecycle data; pooled international datasets estimate fifth centiles around 10.4 g/dL for 6–23 months, 11.0 g/dL for 24–59 months, 11.4 g/dL for 5–11 years, 12.2 g/dL for adolescent females and 12.8 g/dL for adolescent males, 12.0 g/dL for adult females, and 13.5 g/dL for adult males, reinforcing that adult sex-specific thresholds diverge after puberty while ancestry differences do not necessitate separate cutoffs [^117VSpoi].

> I need to ensure these statistical thresholds align with physiology. The hemoglobin–soluble transferrin receptor curves demonstrate inflection points around 9.61 g/dL in children and 11.01 g/dL in women, consistent with the onset of tissue iron deficiency and increased erythropoiesis, which supports the plausibility of lower statistical cutoffs reflecting pathophysiology rather than mere statistical artifacts [^114RHEFM] [^116cVcA4].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-specific thresholds. WHO's trimester-specific cutoffs of 11.0, 10.5, and 11.0 g/dL have been challenged by gestational age–specific centiles showing wider physiologic ranges and lower centiles compatible with good maternal and perinatal outcomes; for example, fifth centiles near 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and 10.6 g/dL in the second trimester, with insufficient data for the third trimester in some analyses, while other work proposes continuous centile-based definitions rather than fixed cutoffs across gestation [^117VSpoi] [^113SovAM]. But wait, what if we consider outcome-linked thresholds? Observational meta-analyses associate very low maternal hemoglobin, particularly less than 7–8 g/dL, with markedly increased risks of adverse outcomes, whereas mild anemia around 10.0–10.5 g/dL shows weaker and inconsistent associations, underscoring the need for etiology-aware, timing-sensitive definitions rather than a single fixed threshold [^117U9ZFd] [^1134WNkA].

> Let me consider pediatrics more carefully. The WHO 6–59 month band is likely too broad; emerging data support at least two subgroups, with fifth centiles near 10.4 g/dL for 6–23 months and 11.0 g/dL for 24–59 months, and sex differences emerge after puberty, aligning with developmental hematology and endocrine drivers of hemoglobin concentration [^117VSpoi] [^112Vvy15]. I should double-check that these pediatric thresholds are derived from healthy reference populations with exclusion of iron deficiency, inflammation, and other confounders, which strengthens their validity for case definition in children [^117VSpoi].

> Now, I will examine transfusion thresholds in adults, since these are often conflated with anemia definitions. High-quality evidence supports restrictive transfusion strategies using 7–8 g/dL triggers for most hemodynamically stable adults, including critical care, surgical, and oncologic populations, without excess mortality or major morbidity compared with liberal thresholds of 9–10 g/dL; exceptions include some cardiac surgery, acute coronary syndromes, and neurologic injury contexts where individualized higher thresholds may be reasonable pending further evidence [^116WX4Uc] [^117QbNoA] [^115ypWsB] [^1174U4w4]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric and neonatal contexts; for very preterm neonates, restrictive thresholds vary by postnatal age and respiratory support, typically 7–11 g/dL, reflecting developmental oxygen delivery physiology and trial evidence [^112vSP7r].

> I need to check CKD-specific targets and monitoring cadence. KDIGO and KDOQI define anemia in adults with CKD as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in women, with age-specific pediatric thresholds, and recommend measuring hemoglobin at least annually in stage 3, twice yearly in stages 4–5, and every 3 months in dialysis, while advising individualized ESA use with caution about targeting hemoglobin above 11–12 g/dL due to cardiovascular risk; recent UK guidance operationalizes ESA dose adjustments around 10.5–11.5 g/dL with a population target mean near 11.0 g/dL [^116SofJW] [^1112LeGY] [^113Fvu1a] [^116Tii6A]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FDA mandated interrupting ESA at hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dL; let me verify and correct that — FDA labeling emphasizes using the lowest ESA dose to avoid transfusion and to reduce or interrupt ESA when hemoglobin approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reflecting safety concerns rather than a rigid statutory mandate, which aligns with guideline cautions [^115Z7omM] [^115JCo1f].

> Next, I should review adjustments for altitude, smoking, and ancestry. Altitude increases hemoglobin via hypoxia-driven erythropoiesis; WHO's 2024 update introduces a refined altitude adjustment equation that modestly increases anemia prevalence at 500–3000 m and decreases it above 3500 m compared with older formulas, though physiologists debate the clinical relevance of adjustments below 1500 m where oxygen saturation changes are minimal [^116jqNBb]. Smoking elevates hemoglobin and is typically adjusted by about +0.3 g/dL in women, while ancestry analyses to date do not support ancestry-specific anemia thresholds beyond standard altitude and smoking corrections, reinforcing the use of universal statistical centiles with appropriate adjustments [^117VSpoi].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. First, for global public health surveillance, adopting lower, pooled fifth percentile cutoffs for children and nonpregnant women would reduce overdiagnosis and better reflect pathophysiology, though WHO has not yet universally adopted these revisions pending broader consensus and outcome validation [^116cVcA4] [^111hLzUE]. Second, for individual diagnosis, clinicians should interpret hemoglobin within clinical context, recognizing that restrictive transfusion thresholds of 7–8 g/dL are safe for most stable adults and that CKD care should individualize ESA use with attention to hemoglobin trajectories rather than fixed high targets [^116WX4Uc] [^113Fvu1a]. Third, in pregnancy, I should confirm that fixed cutoffs are imperfect; gestational age–specific centiles and etiology-informed evaluation may outperform rigid thresholds, and very low hemoglobin levels clearly warrant urgent intervention given strong associations with adverse outcomes [^113SovAM] [^1134WNkA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; uncertainties remain. Many proposed statistical thresholds still lack direct linkage to hard clinical outcomes, pregnancy thresholds require more third-trimester and peripartum data, and transfusion decisions in subgroups like acute coronary syndromes or traumatic brain injury need higher-certainty trials; until then, shared decision-making and careful symptom–physiology integration remain essential [^115eXCjM] [^1136bE4u] [^116WX4Uc].

> In summary, I should confirm that the field is moving toward lower, evidence-based statistical thresholds for children and nonpregnant women, gestational age–aware ranges in pregnancy, and restrictive, context-sensitive transfusion policies, all while preserving necessary adjustments for altitude and smoking and acknowledging that ancestry-specific thresholds are not currently supported; this evolution aims to harmonize definitions, reduce misclassification, and align anemia diagnosis with physiology and outcomes [^117VSpoi] [^116WX4Uc] [^116jqNBb].

The hemoglobin (Hb) cutoff for anemia is **< 13.0 g/dL in adult men, < 12.0 g/dL in adult non-pregnant women, and < 11.0 g/dL in children 6–59 months and pregnant women in the first and third trimesters** [^116q5b2E] [^111sujdV]. For pregnancy, **second-trimester anemia is defined as Hb < 10.5 g/dL** [^111sujdV]. These WHO thresholds are widely used for diagnosis and surveillance, but recent evidence suggests that lower cutoffs may better reflect physiological variation in some populations, prompting ongoing re-evaluation [^111jKc1a] [^117VSpoi].

## WHO hemoglobin cutoffs for anemia

The WHO defines anemia using **age-, sex-, and pregnancy-specific Hb thresholds**:

| **Population group** | **Hb cutoff (g/dl)** |
|-|-|
| Adult men (≥ 15 years) | < 13.0 |
| Adult non-pregnant women (≥ 15 years) | < 12.0 |
| Children 6–59 months | < 11.0 |
| Pregnant women (first trimester) | < 11.0 |
| Pregnant women (second trimester) | < 10.5 |
| Pregnant women (third trimester) | < 11.0 |

---

These cutoffs are based on the fifth percentile of Hb distributions in healthy reference populations and are adjusted for altitude and smoking where applicable [^1122Vp8f] [^116jqNBb].

---

## Physiological basis for hemoglobin cutoffs

Hb cutoffs are derived from population distributions of healthy individuals, typically set at the fifth percentile to capture the lower tail of normal variation [^113D8qwA]. This approach assumes that values below this threshold are **statistically abnormal** and may indicate pathological anemia.

---

## Clinical implications of hemoglobin cutoffs

Hb cutoffs guide diagnosis, severity grading, and management. Severity is categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on Hb concentration, which informs treatment decisions and monitoring strategies [^1134WNkA]. However, **fixed cutoffs may not reflect physiological variation** across populations, potentially leading to over- or under-diagnosis in certain groups [^111h3KRE].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Several **limitations and controversies** surround current Hb cutoffs:

- **Population specificity**: WHO cutoffs were derived primarily from Western populations and may not generalize to diverse ethnic and geographic groups [^1122Vp8f] [^112J88Dz].
- **Physiological variation**: Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors influence Hb levels, challenging the universality of fixed cutoffs [^113N11i1].
- **Clinical outcomes**: Hb cutoffs are statistical rather than outcome-based, raising questions about their clinical relevance [^1122Vp8f].

---

## Recent evidence and proposed revisions

Recent studies suggest that **lower Hb cutoffs** may be appropriate for certain populations. For example, a large multinational analysis proposed lower fifth percentile thresholds for children and non-pregnant women, reflecting physiological variation and potentially reducing overdiagnosis [^111jKc1a] [^117VSpoi]. Similarly, a study in Indian adolescents found that WHO cutoffs were higher than population-specific fifth percentiles, supporting the need for population-specific thresholds [^111h3KRE].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **special consideration** when applying Hb cutoffs:

- **Altitude**: Higher altitudes increase Hb due to hypoxia, necessitating altitude-specific adjustments [^116jqNBb].
- **Smoking**: Smoking elevates Hb levels, requiring adjustments to avoid underestimation of anemia [^1153UFYL].
- **Genetic disorders**: Conditions like thalassemia and sickle cell disease affect Hb levels, complicating the use of standard cutoffs [^113N11i1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized assessment** and context-specific thresholds. For example, the British Society of Gastroenterology recommends using Hb cutoffs below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory, while KDIGO provides age-specific thresholds for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^116SeqRE] [^1116VmVe].

---

## Impact of hemoglobin cutoffs on public health

Hb cutoffs significantly influence public health by shaping anemia prevalence estimates, guiding screening programs, and informing policy. Overestimation of anemia prevalence can lead to unnecessary interventions, whereas underestimation may delay necessary treatment [^114DHhpN].

---

## Future directions and research needs

Future research should focus on **developing outcome-based Hb thresholds** linked to clinical outcomes, validating population-specific cutoffs, and integrating genetic and environmental factors into anemia definitions [^111Ucimy]. Such efforts will improve the accuracy and relevance of anemia diagnosis globally [^117VSpoi].

---

The WHO hemoglobin cutoffs for anemia are widely used but face ongoing scrutiny due to population specificity and physiological variation. Recent evidence suggests that **lower, population-specific thresholds may be more appropriate** in some settings, prompting continued research and potential guideline updates [^117VSpoi].

Key Points

Question

Are the current World Health Organization (WHO) hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs to define anemia comparable to statistical and physiological Hb cutoffs calculated using representative surveys from multiple countries collected in the last 20 years?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 79 950 Hb observations from population-based surveys that covered all WHO geographical regions, the WHO cutoffs for defining anemia were higher than the fifth percentile of nearly all countries except the US. This finding held for children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years and was confirmed using a physiological measure of increased red blood cell production.

Meaning

These findings suggest that lower Hb cutoffs based on pooled multinational data can be considered for defining anemia among children and nonpregnant women.

Conclusions

On the basis of data from more than 39 000 individuals from 25 countries examined, the current WHO hemoglobin cutoff levels for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women were found to be significantly higher than the fifth percentile of Hb in apparently healthy individuals from most countries evaluated. Future studies focusing on Hb thresholds associated with functional and clinical health outcomes will improve the understanding of overall disease burden. Until then, revising Hb cutoff level definitions according to pooled multinational data could be considered.

Introduction

Anemia, or low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration insufficient to meet an individual's physiological needs, is the most common blood condition and affects approximately one-third of the world's population. The World Health Organization (WHO) Hb cutoffs to define anemiawere first established in 1968 by experts who stated that, "over 95% of normal individuals are believed to show Hb levels higher than the cutoffs given" (ie, 11.0 g/dL for children and 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Although these cutoffs were derived from a few studies involving European, and North American, (US and Canada) men, children, and pregnant women, they have been applied uniformly among all geographical regions, with adjustments for those residing at higher altitudes or who smoke cigarettes.

Evaluation of the WHO Hb cutoffs has been a subject of active research for decades. These cutoffs were derived from statistical cutoffs not linked with physiological or health outcomes. Furthermore, the appropriateness of these cutoffs for defining anemia among certain population groups, age groups, and ethnicities has been questioned repeatedly. There is an urgent need to reexamine global thresholds to define anemia using data from diverse populations and low-income and middle-income countries to inform public health programs. Thus, our objectives were to test the appropriateness of pooling the fifth percentile Hb cutoff levels from different multinational surveys, compare survey-specific and pooled fifth percentile Hb estimates with the current WHO Hb anemia cutoffs, and examine the validity of Hb cutoffs by using a physiological indicator of erythropoiesis or red blood cell production using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), among children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years. This work could have clinical and programmatic implications for anemia screening and control globally.

### Outcomes using lower vs higher hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion [^117QbNoA]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is a lower vs higher hemoglobin threshold best for minimizing both red blood cell use and adverse clinical outcomes when used to trigger red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients in critical care and acute care settings?

Bottom Line

Compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay.

KDOQI hemoglobin target recommendation — the selected Hb target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, with the words generally and range intentionally chosen to provide flexibility based on patients' needs and responsiveness to ESA therapy; the 2 specific values 11.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL define either a single Hb target range (11.0 to 12.0 g/dL) or a range of possible single-point Hb targets between 11.0 and 12.0 g/dL, explicitly exclude reference to achieved Hb levels, and balance benefits against potential harm in patients with Hb targets greater than 13 g/dL; available RCTs illustrate the distinction between a Hb target range and a discrete Hb target, and the lack of information to support specific Hb cutoff values renders statement 2.1.2 a CPR.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HuriJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Key strengths of this review are the inclusion of both ends of the spectrum for Hb concentrations and the range of adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant. Stratification of results by Hb cutoff and timing of assessment also adds further depth and understanding to these complex relationships. Associations between low Hb and adverse outcomes tend to be stronger earlier in pregnancy while associations between high Hb and adverse outcomes were inconsistent across time points. Mixed findings in the second trimester may point to a need to further examine optimal cutoffs during this period.

Our study is one of the largest systematic reviews to date on this topic, including data collected in 69 different countries over a 30-year time period. As such there is high heterogeneity in our analysis driven by differences in definitions and measurement of exposure (maternal Hb) and outcomes as well as potential true differences by context, perhaps driven by variable etiology of anemia and high Hb. It is important to note that this review examines observational associations that could be confounded by underlying socioeconomic, health or environmental factors and thus cannot establish causality. Furthermore, there are inherent limitations of using dichotomous characterizations of Hb rather than understanding risk across a range of continuous values of Hb. In addition, where data were available we stratified by trimester of pregnancy; however, a closer examination of maternal Hb by week of gestation and application of the new gestational age-specific centiles for maternal hemoglobin concentrations from the INTERGROWTH study would be ideal. Future work with pooled individual level data and standardized adjustment for known confounding factors may allow for greater clarity on associations of hemoglobin level and increased risk of adverse outcomes. Depending on the prevalence of the adverse outcomes, future reporting of relative risk may be preferable. This review is limited by the data available. Notably, there is a lack of data on the etiology of low or high Hb and many gaps remain in understanding the role of timing and cutoffs across preconception and pregnancy. Studies that reported data using multiple Hb cutoffs or time points were more heavily weighted in the overall estimates. Hb is a convenient and widely used biomarker in nutrition and health research, however it remains unclear if the associations with adverse outcomes are being driven by direct alterations in functional Hb for essential functions or by the indirect underlying causes of anemia (e.g. iron deficiency vs. hemoglobinopathy) or high Hb (e.g. excess iron vs. failure of plasma volume expansion). Further research is needed to better understand the implications of the etiology of anemia for redefining optimal Hb cutoffs during pregnancy and optimizing public health programs for women.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^114RHEFM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Anemia screening in clinical practice and public health surveillance guides programs and interventions. Where possible, Hb cutoffs defining anemia and its severity should be guided by functional and clinically relevant outcomes. Although clinical outcomes were not available in this work, we modeled Hb to sTfR concentrations, which physiologically reflect erythropoiesis. The curves of Hb-sTfR concentrations indicate distinct curvilinear and linear erythropoietic drive phases when Hb values are below a threshold (9.61 g/dL in children and 11.01 g/dL in women) (Figure 2). The linear erythropoietic drive phase describes the expected compensatory physiological response to anemia, including increased tissue demand for iron and increased erythroid in the bone marrow. The physiological Hb-sTfR curves support the use of a pooled multinational Hb fifth percentile for defining anemia, as opposed to adopting Hb estimates that are specific to a survey, country, or race/ethnicity, which could lead to proliferation of multiple different Hb cutoffs and, thus, complicate their clinical application and global disease burden quantification, among other factors. We found that in both preschool children and women, regardless of Hb distribution, the population fifth percentile Hb was lower than 9.61 g/dL and 11.01 g/dL, indicating that tissue ID has already ensued (Figure 2). The Hb fifth percentile derived in this analysis may reflect the development of anemia apparently caused by ID. A cautious interpretation is needed when using Hb alone to identify anemia and guide candidate interventions, as evaluating the factors associated with the development of anemia beyond ID, such as malaria (in endemic regions), vitamin A, vitamin B 12, folate, and inherited blood disorders, is essential to guide anemia management.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of our work include the use of a large data set of household-based nutrition surveys with biomarkers of ID, vitamin A deficiency, inflammation, and malaria from healthy and diverse populations from multiple geographical regions. Furthermore, we excluded participants with known select proximal factors associated with risk of anemia to identify apparently healthy persons. Similarly, the physiological Hb-for-sTfR curve analyses yielded Hb thresholds similar to those generated from the fifth percentile of population-specific Hb estimates among children and women. We calculated the Hb fifth percentile from the empirical distribution for robust estimates rather than using close-form expressions (of means and SD), both of which can be affected by Hb measurement issues across surveys. The application of piecewise cubic spline equations enabled complex sTfR-Hb relationships to be captured.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^115ypWsB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia in a national sample of healthy children and adolescents aged 1–19 years in India: a population-based study [^111h3KRE]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

WHO's haemoglobin cutoffs to define anemia were based on five studies of predominantly White adult populations, done over 50 years ago. Therefore, a general re-examination of the existing haemoglobin cutoffs is warranted for global application, in representative healthy populations of children and adults. Such data are scarce in low-income and middle-income countries; however, a 2019, large-scale, nationally representative survey of children and adolescents aged 0–19 years in India (Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey [CNNS]) offered an opportunity for this re-examination. Using this survey, we aimed to assess the age-specific and sex-specific percentiles of haemoglobin and cutoffs to define anaemia in the CNNS population.

Methods

For this population-based study, we constructed age-specific and sex-specific haemoglobin percentiles from values reported for a defined healthy population in the CNNS, which used rigorous quality control measures during sample collection and in the laboratory analyses. To obtain a healthy population, we excluded participants with iron, folate, vitamin B12, and retinol deficiencies; inflammation; variant haemoglobins (haemoglobin A 2 and haemoglobin S); and history of smoking. We considered age-specific and sex-specific 5th percentiles of haemoglobin derived for this healthy population as the study cutoff to define anaemia. We compared these with existing WHO cutoffs to assess significant differences between them at each year of age and sex for quantifying the prevalence of anaemia in the entire CNNS sample.

Findings

Between Feb 24, 2016, and Oct 26, 2018, the CNNS survey collected blood samples from 49486 individuals. 41210 participants had a haemoglobin value, 8087 of whom were included in our study and comprised the primary analytical sample. Compared with existing WHO cutoffs, the study cutoffs for haemoglobin were lower at all ages, usually by 1–2 g/dL, but more so in children of both sexes aged 1–2 years and in girls aged 10 years or older. Aanemia prevalence with the study cutoffs was 19.2 percentage points lower than with WHO cutoffs in the entire CNNS sample with valid haemoglobin values across all ages and sexes (10.8% with study cutoffs vs 30.0% with WHO cutoffs).

Interpretation

These findings support the re-examination of WHO haemoglobin cutoffs to define anaemia. Our haemoglobin reference percentiles, derived from healthy participants in a large representative Indian survey, are suitable for national use in India. Substantial variations in the 5th percentile of haemoglobin values across the 1–19 years age range and between sexes argue against constructing common cutoffs in stratified age groups for convenience.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia in a national sample of healthy children and adolescents aged 1–19 years in India: a population-based study [^112J88Dz]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

An insufficiency in red blood cell mass to adequately deliver oxygen to peripheral tissues is defined as anaemia, from a functional perspective. An accurate case definition is crucial for both individualised clinical care and public health management. Anaemia is conventionally identified when the haemoglobin concentration in blood falls under an age-specific and sex-specific threshold or cutoff. However, the cutoffs proposed by WHO vary substantially from those proposed by other organisations such as the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expert clinical organisations, haematology textbooks, or even individual clinical and research laboratories. However, the WHO cutoffs are used globally by most countries, especially to determine the burden of anaemia in a population.

The existing WHO cutoffs to define anaemia were first proposed in 1968, from five studies of predominantly white adult populations in North America and Europe;, at the time, data from various ages — especially for infants, young children, adolescents, and older people — were not available. In 2000, in addition to adjustments for altitude and smoking, the age group 5–14 years was split to define a lower haemoglobin cutoff for children aged 5 — 11 years, on the basis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2 data. No separate cutoffs were defined for infants younger than 6 months; the reference value for age 2 — 6 months was added in a later WHO document.

A 2019 review of 60 global studies, reported between 1975 and 2018, evaluated haemoglobin variation across the lifecycle. Haemoglobin cutoffs for anaemia similar to WHO recommendations were reported in several studies but tended to be lower for infants, young children, premenopausal women, and older people and higher for men. The haemoglobin cutoffs in children and adolescents from African and Asian regions were substantially lower (1–2 g/dL) in some datasets. However, limited conclusions can be made regarding the normal reference ranges because only a few studies had specifically excluded individuals with iron deficiency or inflammation. There were also uncertainties regarding the optimal testing methods to measure haemoglobin concentration. Although anaemia is defined functionally, its diagnosis is presently based on a haemoglobin cutoff that is statistically derived rather than on functional or health outcomes, which would be ideal. The present haemoglobin cutoffs for anaemia, derived 50 years ago, need reassessment to potentially enhance the evaluation of determinants, burden quantification, and the management of anaemia at the individual and population level.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^111oCyPd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Growing evidence suggests low and high maternal hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations may have adverse consequences for maternal and child health. There remain questions on specific Hb thresholds to define anemia and high Hb as well as how cutoffs may vary by anemia etiology and timing of assessment.

Methods

We conducted an updated systematic review (using PubMed and Cochrane Review) on low (< 110 g/L) and high (≥ 130 g/L) maternal Hb concentrations and associations with a range of maternal and infant health outcomes. We examined associations by timing of Hb assessment (preconception; first, second, and third trimesters, as well as at any time point in pregnancy), varying cutoffs used for defining low and high hemoglobin concentrations and performed stratified analyses by iron-deficiency anemia. We conducted meta-analyses to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

The updated systematic review included 148 studies. Low maternal Hb at any time point in pregnancy was associated with: low birthweight, LBW (OR (95% CI) 1.28 (1.22–1.35)), very low birthweight, VLBW (2.15 (1.47–3.13)), preterm birth, PTB (1.35 (1.29–1.42)), small-for-gestational age, SGA (1.11 (1.02–1.19)), stillbirth 1.43 (1.24–1.65)), perinatal mortality (1.75 (1.28–2.39)), neonatal mortality (1.25 (1.16–1.34), postpartum hemorrhage (1.69 (1.45–1.97)), transfusion (3.68 (2.58–5.26)), pre-eclampsia (1.57 (1.23–2.01)), and prenatal depression (1.44 (1.24–1.68)). For maternal mortality, the OR was higher for Hb < 90 (4.83 (2.17–10.74)) than for Hb < 100 (2.87 (1.08–7.67)). High maternal Hb was associated with: VLBW (1.35 (1.16–1.57)), PTB (1.12 (1.00–1.25)), SGA (1.17 (1.09–1.25)), stillbirth (1.32 (1.09–1.60)), maternal mortality (2.01 (1.12–3.61)), gestational diabetes (1.71 (1.19–2.46)), and pre-eclampsia (1.34 (1.16–1.56)). Stronger associations were noted earlier in pregnancy for low Hb and adverse birth outcomes while the role of timing of high Hb was inconsistent. Lower Hb cutoffs were associated with greater odds of poor outcomes; for high Hb, data were too limited to identify patterns. Information on anemia etiology was limited; relationships did not vary by iron-deficiency anemia.

Conclusion

Both low and high maternal Hb concentrations during pregnancy are strong predictors of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Additional research is needed to establish healthy reference ranges and design effective interventions to optimize maternal Hb during pregnancy.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^116cVcA4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Anemia, defined as low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration insufficient to meet an individual's physiological needs, is the most common blood condition worldwide.

Objective

To evaluate the current World Health Organization (WHO) Hb cutoffs for defining anemia among persons who are apparently healthy and to assess threshold validity with a biomarker of tissue iron deficiency and physiological indicator of erythropoiesis (soluble transferrin receptor [sTfR]) using multinational data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, data were collected and evaluated from 30 household, population-based nutrition surveys of preschool children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years during 2005 to 2016 across 25 countries. Data analysis was performed from March 2020 to April 2021.

Exposure

Anemia defined according to WHO Hb cutoffs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

To define the healthy population, persons with iron deficiency (ferritin < 12 ng/mL for children or < 15 ng/mL for women), vitamin A deficiency (retinol-binding protein or retinol < 20.1 μg/dL), inflammation (C-reactive protein > 0.5 mg/dL or α-1-acid glycoprotein > 1 g/L), or known malaria were excluded. Survey-specific, pooled Hb fifth percentile cutoffs were estimated. Among individuals with Hb and sTfR data, Hb-for-sTfR curve analysis was conducted to identify Hb inflection points that reflect tissue iron deficiency and increased erythropoiesis induced by anemia.

Results

A total of 79 950 individuals were included in the original surveys. The final healthy sample was 13 445 children (39.9% of the original sample of 33 699 children; 6750 boys [50.2%]; mean [SD] age 32.9 [16.0] months) and 25 880 women (56.0% of the original sample of 46 251 women; mean [SD] age, 31.0 [9.5] years). Survey-specific Hb fifth percentile among children ranged from 7.90 g/dL (95% CI, 7.54–8.26 g/dL in Pakistan) to 11.23 g/dL (95% CI, 11.14–11.33 g/dL in the US), and among women from 8.83 g/dL (95% CI, 7.77–9.88 g/dL in Gujarat, India) to 12.09 g/dL (95% CI, 12.00–12.17 g/dL in the US). Intersurvey variance around the Hb fifth percentile was low (3.5% for women and 3.6% for children). Pooled fifth percentile estimates were 9.65 g/dL (95% CI, 9.26–10.04 g/dL) for children and 10.81 g/dL (95% CI, 10.35–11.27 g/dL) for women. The Hb-for-sTfR curve demonstrated curvilinear associations with sTfR inflection points occurring at Hb of 9.61 g/dL (95% CI, 9.55–9.67 g/dL) among children and 11.01 g/dL (95% CI, 10.95–11.09 g/dL) among women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current WHO cutoffs to define anemia are higher than the pooled fifth percentile of Hb among persons who are outwardly healthy and from nearly all survey-specific estimates. The lower proposed Hb cutoffs are statistically significant but also reflect compensatory increased erythropoiesis. More studies based on clinical outcomes could further confirm the validity of these Hb cutoffs for anemia.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^116q5b2E]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of global standards for anemia diagnosis and outdated definitions represent other aspects of the challenge of estimating the burden of anemia. The commonly used thresholds for defining anemia are largely arbitrary. These thresholds, such as those recommended by the WHO, were initially based on Hb distributions observed in limited populations, predominantly from Western countries (Europe, the United States, and Canada) in the 1960s, and were not derived from direct associations with health outcomes. While revising these thresholds might seem straightforward, accurately defining anemia remains highly complex. This complexity arises from recognized differences in biological, geographical, and geopolitical factors, compounded by challenges related to measurement methods, test validity, and accessibility.

Current Hb concentration cutoffs established by the WHO for anemia diagnosis (13.0 g/dL for men aged 15 years and older, 11.0 g/dL for children, and 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women) may not reflect functional outcomes or current clinical practice. Also, they do not appear to be linked with physiological, health, or other relevant outcomes. A cross‐sectional study based on 79 950 Hb observations from 30 global nutrition surveys conducted between 2005 and 2016 across 25 countries revealed that WHO cutoffs are higher than the fifth percentile in most countries, except the United States. This pattern was observed in 13 445 children aged 6–59 months and 25 880 nonpregnant women aged 15–49 years. Elevated levels of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), a biomarker, were used to assess increased demand for iron due to red blood cell production, which can indicate iron deficiency anemia rather than other anemia types. All this has led to incomplete epidemiological definitions: anemia cutoffs should consider intersectional factors such as age, sex/gender, smoking, pregnancy, and underlying health status.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MxBFE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

A critical component of tracking progress towards global targets is having an agreed upon definition of anemia by the global community. WHO Hb cutoffs for defining anemia are currently being re-examined. The WHO anemia cutoffs are based on limited data, in particular for pregnant women, and lack global representativeness and are widely acknowledged as outdated as they do not account for gestational age-specific changes in plasma volume expansion. Current overall anemia cutoffs are defined as < 110 g/L during pregnancy, or trimester-specific anemia cutoffs (first trimester: < 110 g/L; second trimester: < 105 g/L; third trimester: < 110 g/L). Across the literature, there is often inconsistency in the range of Hb cutoffs used to define low and high Hb thresholds, which impacts the prevalence of the problem and likelihood of detecting relationships with adverse maternal and child outcomes. Studies using multiple Hb cutoffs have reported that in some cases only lower cutoff values were associated with adverse outcomes. Few studies have evaluated the long-term health impact of maternal Hb concentrations. An exception is a recent analysis of data from the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project, a study of prospective, population-based data from Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, the United Kingdom and the United States. This analysis provides maternal Hb normative centiles during pregnancy associated with positive birth outcomes as well as adequate child growth and development across the first 1000 days. The results suggest Hb cutoffs during pregnancy that are lower than currently recommended by the WHO. However, key knowledge gaps remain on the optimal thresholds of maternal Hb concentration related to both maternal and infant health, and whether those thresholds vary by anemia etiology or timing of measurement. In response to the WHO call to re-evaluate the evidence on hemoglobin thresholds to define anemia, we previously conducted a systematic review on maternal Hb concentrations and maternal and infant health outcomes including studies through October 2018. Since then, significant new research has been reported on outcomes of interest, such as maternal depression and maternal mortality, that were not included in the previous meta-analysis due to a paucity of studies.

The objective of this study was to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations of low and high maternal Hb concentrations during pregnancy with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Analyses were stratified by timing of Hb assessment (preconception, first, second and third trimesters), Hb cutoff category, and etiology of anemia (iron-deficiency anemia/non-iron deficiency anemia).

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^117HxB8S]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The current WHO cutoff levels were derived from mainly White adultsbut were validated in a multiethnic sample from a single country (US). The results of our multinational pooled fifth percentile Hb estimates were consistent with several studies, that have called for a downward revision of the Hb cutoffs by approximately 1.0 g/dL for a variety of reasons, including a recent 2021 publication by Sachdev et althat suggests the use of lower Hb cutoffs to define anemia in children using data from the 2016 India Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey. However, these prior studies were based on examination of effect sizes from published research or data from individual countries. Our study advances knowledge of Hb distributions across countries as we analyzed expansive individual-level data sets that included Hb, micronutrient biomarkers, infection (malaria), and inflammation. We were able to leverage these biomarkers to identify an apparently healthy subpopulation, which is unique compared with prior validation research of the WHO Hb cutoffs that were limited to iron status of US participants. The low intersurvey variance around the lower tail of the fifth percentile Hb distribution may be explained by anemia etiology, which is multifactorial but may be similar across countries. We adjusted Hb for altitude and smoking (among women), when data were available, thereby reducing their confounding role on Hb. There was low intersurvey variance when analyzing individual-level Hb data of 39 325 apparently healthy individuals, but high interstudy heterogeneity from meta-analysis highlighting the limitation of meta-analyses to directly address this study objective.

Chronic kidney disease anemia — upper hemoglobin limit for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy — contrasts the KDIGO limit of 11.5 g/dL with the FDA's 11 g/dL; the commentary notes there may be a stronger rationale for 11 g/dL and that the FDA has selected 11 g/dL as the Hb cutoff at which they recommend clinicians should either interrupt or hold ESA treatment, concluding, "We therefore continue to endorse the FDA-recommended upper cutoff of 11 g/dL (110 g/L)".

### What constitutes normal hemoglobin concentration in community-dwelling disabled older women? [^116YK4Uw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the associations between hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and (1) 5-year all-cause mortality and (2) serum erythropoietin (EPO), as the basis for the identification of data-driven thresholds, and to assess the clinical relevance of mildly low Hb.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Population based.

Participants

Community-dwelling women aged 65 and older with moderate-to-severe disability — Women's Health and Aging Study I, Baltimore, Maryland, 1992–2000.

Methods

Proportional hazards regression was used to model the relationship between baseline Hb (available for 686 subjects) and time to death. A generalized linear model was used to assess the cross-sectional association between Hb and EPO in 641 subjects.

Results

A curvilinear slope of steady mortality decrease up to the Hb threshold of 13.9 g/dL was observed. Hb of 11 g/dL was independently associated with greater mortality than the World Health Organization (WHO) low-normal cutoff of Hb of 12 g/dL (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–1.4), whereas Hb of 14 g/dL was linked to 24% lower mortality (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63–0.92), after comprehensive adjustment for major health status and disease-burden indicators. A curvilinear, statistically significant slope of steady EPO decrease with increasing Hb up to the threshold of 14.3 g/dL was consistently observed.

Conclusion

The meaningfully lower mortality risk with higher Hb levels provides empirical evidence against the notion that Hb currently perceived as mildly low is clinically benign. Furthermore, the mortality risk gradient observed even within the WHO normal Hb range suggests that Hb levels higher than what is currently recommended might offer clinical advantage. The relationship between Hb and EPO provided supporting physiological evidence for this hypothesis.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^111hLzUE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

By use of data from apparently healthy individuals from 27 surveys representing all WHO geographical regions, we found that the calculated multinational estimates of Hb fifth percentile were 1.35 and 1.19 g/dL lower than the current WHO Hb cutoffs for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women, respectively. Aside from 2 countries, the survey-specific fifth percentile Hb estimates were significantly lower than the WHO cutoffs for anemia. Intersurvey variance around the Hb fifth percentile was less than 4%, which supports the appropriateness of pooling individual Hb data from a multinational sample and deriving a single-population, group-specific cutoff. The statistical fifth percentile Hb pooled results were reinforced by the physiological association between Hb and increased sTfR concentrations (reflective of iron-deficient erythropoiesis) at Hb concentrations very similar to what was derived from the pooled fifth percentile Hb analysis for each population group. Our findings were not affected when using higher ferritin cutoffsfor defining ID, which highlights the robustness of these multinational Hb cutoffs for individuals with marked variations in normative Hb and ferritin concentrations.

Fetal anemia severity classification and thresholds — hemoglobin multiples of the median (MoM) define mild (MoM 0.83–0.65), moderate (MoM 0.64–0.55), and severe (MoM < 0.55) anemia; severe anemia can lead to hydrops fetalis and fetal death, and hydrops related to anemia is rare when hemoglobin is greater than 5 g/dL (corresponding to 0.47 MoM at 18 weeks and 0.36 MoM at 37 weeks); using a fetal hematocrit of less than 30% as a cutoff appears equally reliable and is often used in clinical care.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all pregnant persons be screened for anemia at their first prenatal visit, preferably during the first trimester of pregnancy; ACOG recommends repeat screening at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal supplementation for all pregnant persons with an oral low-dose iron supplement (30 mg/d).

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^114hvtVQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia usually vary between men and women, although this distinction has been challenged. Thresholds can also vary in children and during pregnancy. Haemoglobin concentrations can be lower in African, or Asian populations, but it is unclear whether this discrepancy reflects clinically significant genetic conditions affecting red cells, undefined clinical illnesses, or a different underlying baseline driven by non-clinical genetic variation.

WHO has recognised the need for further evidence for haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia, including the influence of genetic factors (both carrier states for rare genetic conditions such as thalassaemias and haemoglobinopathies, and the role of genetics in overall variation), in order to update global guidelines. Here, we present an analysis utilising multiple large-scale datasets in ethnically diverse populations that included sufficiently detailed clinical and laboratory parameters to enable post-hoc assembly of reference populations of healthy individuals without discernible risk factors for anaemia, in which the fifth centile of haemoglobin distribution can be estimated across the lifecycle. Additionally, we summarised ancestry-specific allele frequencies and effects on haemoglobin concentrations of genetic polymorphisms and structural variants identified through existing large-scale, multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We aimed to provide a rationale for a set of thresholds that can be applied globally for clinical and population use.

Chronic anemia and transfusion thresholds — commentary highlights conservative triggers and individualized assessment. The threshold for transfusion in chronic anemia in the absence of symptoms is approximately 7 g/dL, prior clinical practice used higher Hb goals when Hb concentration targets were greater than 10.0 or 11.0 g/dL, and a careful within-patient assessment of symptoms before and after transfusion may be the best strategy to determine a patient-specific threshold until better evidence is available.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^113tqQKT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The new Hb centiles allow comparisons across countries and regions using the same definitions and thresholds for potential interventions at population level, so as to harmonise efforts by WHO and other public health organisations to prevent and treat nutritional anaemias. Given the importance of evidence-informed interventions to improve maternal and child nutrition, we believe that national and international guidelines on antenatal care should take account of our findings. The fact that the centiles are gestational age-specific should also encourage policymakers to ensure that the gestational age of every pregnancy is estimated as accurately as possible, in line with the WHO 2016 guidelines.

Clearly, compared to the current recommendation, the derived haemoglobin distributions may have major policy implications because, once implemented, fewer pregnant women may be diagnosed with anaemia and the prevalence of low Hb levels will be substantially lower. This arises for two main reasons. Firstly, the current definition is derived from a statistical approach based on four very small studies, whereas the new derived haemoglobin distributions are compatible with the levels of functional health outcomes observed in the healthy populations we studied; secondly, we are presenting Hb trajectories according to gestational age rather than a single fixed cut-off across the whole of pregnancy (Fig. 4), which is an implausible biological concept. However, lowering the threshold for defining anaemia towards the end of pregnancy at individual level might have implications for management; for instance, recognising lower thresholds may allow more targeted treatment for anemia, and may alter management in those women who then have a post-partum haemorrhage.

Finally, considering the indisputable need for pregnancy-specific early warning scores that incorporate maternal Hb changes our findings could be used to facilitate earlier recognition and treatment of the unwell pregnant woman and thereby reduce both maternal morbidity and mortality rates worldwide.

Future research that focuses on obtaining accurate data on plasma volume expansion (using non-invasive methods) during healthy pregnancies would be ideal as this parameter has an impact on many biomarkers in pregnancy. Based on these derived gestation-specific centiles, a study that evaluates the statistically derived cut-offs including upper limit cut-offs and the perinatal risk-associated cut-off levels using large datasets with sufficient severe morbidity and mortality events would help to establish and validate the derived thresholds and would add support to more evidence-based protocols for the care of pregnant women.

By cutoff

Summary estimates were created for high Hb and the odds of LBW, VLBW, PTB, SGA, stillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality by Hb concentration cutoff: ≥ 130, ≥ 140, ≥ 150, and ≥ 160 g/L (Table 2). Overall, there were limited data to evaluate different cutoffs and patterns were not clear. The exception was stillbirth, for which the odds doubled when shifting from a cutoff of ≥ 130 g/L (OR (95% CI) 1.32 (1.09–1.60)) to a cutoff of ≥ 140 g/L (OR (95% CI) 2.30 (1.38–3.85)).

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^113aFxxU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Data management and analyses

Data were stratified by low Hb (< 110 g/L) and high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) and by timing of Hb measurement: preconception, first (≤ 13 weeks), second (14–26 weeks), and third (≥ 27 weeks) trimesters. The overall pregnancy estimates for low (< 110 g/L) and high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) included Hb concentrations measured at any time point during pregnancy (including studies with and without gestational age data). The Hb cutoffs used to define anemia varied across studies; thus, we created standard cutoffs to conduct various analyses (≤ 70, ≤ 80, ≤ 90, ≤ 100, ≤ 110, ≥ 130, ≥ 140, ≥ 150, and ≥ 160 g/L) to create summary estimates across Hb concentrations. Each category was cumulative whereby the estimates reported for the ≥ 130 g/L category include measurements for all studies using an Hb cutoff of ≥ 130, including all studies in the ≥ 140, ≥ 150, and ≥ 160 g/L categories. The reference group varied across studies and was either a cutoff (e.g. ≥ 110 g/L) or reference range (e.g. 110–119 g/L). Separate meta-analyses were conducted for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and non-IDA for LBW, PTB, and SGA. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.2 (Stata Corp. 2015, College Station, TX). Values reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals with significance indicated at P < 0.05. Q- and I 2 values over 50% indicated heterogeneity and a Q-statistic P-value of > 0.10 indicated substantial heterogeneity. Given the significant heterogeneity, we used random effect models and the inverse-variance method for weighting for the meta-analyses.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^117U9ZFd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

By cutoff

Summary estimates were created for low Hb and the odds of LBW, VLBW, PTB, SGA, stillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality by Hb concentration cutoff: ≤ 70, ≤ 80, ≤ 90, ≤ 100, and ≤ 110 g/L (Table 1). The odds of poor birth outcomes generally increased as Hb concentration decreased across cutoffs, with strongest associations at the lowest cutoff of ≤ 70 g/L for LBW (OR (95% CI) 2.06 (1.63–2.61)), PTB ≤ 70 g/L: (OR (95% CI) 2.08 (1.67–2.59)), stillbirth ≤ 70 g/L: (OR (95% CI) 2.85 (1.66–4.90)), perinatal mortality ≤ 70 g/L (OR (95% CI) 4.41 (2.21–8.81)) and neonatal mortality ≤ 70 g/L: (OR (95% CI) 1.83 (1.52–2.19)). The odds of VLBW were highest at ≤ 90 g/L (OR (95% CI) 4.95 (1.60–15.29)); however, limited data existed at lower cutoffs. Odds of SGA were similar across Hb cutoffs ranging from OR (95% CI) 1.31 (1.14–1.51) for ≤ 80 g/L to OR (95% CI) 1.11 (1.03–1.19) for ≤ 110 g/L.

By etiology

Limited information was available to examine the role of etiology of anemia (IDA vs. non-IDA) with regard to birth outcomes (See Supplementary Tables 2, Additional File 1). From the data available, neither IDA (by itself) or non-IDA (by itself) during pregnancy was significantly associated with LBW, SGA, or PTB.

### The prognostic effect of hemoglobin on patients with cancer cachexia: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^113QBEhf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the influence of hemoglobin on cancer cachexia and to determine whether hemoglobin affects the prognosis or quality of life of patients with cancer cachexia and whether these effects are caused by an interaction between hemoglobin and other factors.

Material and Methods

This study was a multicenter cohort of 2715 patients with cancer cachexia diagnosed from June 2012 to December 2019. The primary outcomes and measures were overall survival (OS) time and all-cause mortality. The association between hemoglobin and all-cause mortality was evaluated using hazard ratios (HRs) and the restricted cubic spline model with a two-sided p-value. Optimal stratification was used to determine the threshold value. We also evaluated the cross-classification of hemoglobin and each variable with survival.

Results

Among the 2715 participants diagnosed with cancer cachexia, 1592 (58.6%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 58.8 (11.7) years. The optimal cutoff point for hemoglobin as a predictor of cancer cachexia mortality was 140 g/L for males and 101 g/L for females in our research. The decrease in hemoglobin was positively correlated with all-cause mortality. These associations were consistent across cancer subtypes. In the multivariable analysis, after adjusting for sex, age, TNM stage, tumor type, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, Karnofsky performance status score, and other factors, patients diagnosed with cancer cachexia who had low hemoglobin levels were more likely to have a worse prognosis (HR 2.40; 95% CI, 1.12–1.51).

Conclusion

Our results suggested that the proposed hemoglobin cutoff point would be valuable for prognostic prediction in patients with cancer cachexia, especially for long-term prognosis.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^1136bE4u]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Analysis of thresholds in children younger than 6 months, in pregnant women specifically during the third trimester, and among individuals older than 65 years was not possible due to the scarcity of datasets containing sufficient clinical data and simultaneous collection of haemoglobin and inflammatory and iron parameters. Furthermore, among older populations, datasets contained insufficient numbers of individuals meeting our stringent health criteria. Further work, potentially involving prospective studies with carefully defined clinical inclusion criteria, is needed to more precisely estimate thresholds in these important populations.

In conclusion, this study provides an evidence base to harmonise haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia in children and adults worldwide and to inform global guidelines.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia in a national sample of healthy children and adolescents aged 1–19 years in India: a population-based study [^1141wjTQ]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The mean haemoglobin concentrations at various ages were almost identical in girls for the five analytical samples (appendix 5 p 4). Likewise, the mean concentrations were similar in boys except at ages 11–12 years, for which the value was lower in analytical sample 3 and higher in sample 4 (both by approximately 0.5 g/dL) compared with those in analytical samples 1 and 2 (overlapping 95% CIs, p > 0.05 for all five samples). We plotted the smoothed 5th percentile values from each analytical sample, along with their 95% CIs across all ages (appendix 5 p 5). As stated previously, these CIs overlapped in all instances, and the primary analytical sample was used to derive anaemia cutoffs from the CNNS data and for the comparison with WHO cutoffs.

We assessed the sex-specific smoothed haemoglobin (g/dL) percentiles from ages 1–19 years in the analytical sample 1 (figure 2; appendix 5 p 3). The 50th percentile for haemoglobin rose by 1.5 g/dL between ages 1–9 years, with similar values for boys and girls. Subsequently, up to age 19 years, boys had nearly 2 g/dL higher haemoglobin concentrations, whereas these remained constant in girls. The sex difference in haemoglobin concentrations increased to 1 g/dL at age 14–15 years and widened to 2 g/dL at age 19 years. The 5th percentile cutoffs also rose by 1.5 g/dL from ages 1–8 years, with similar values across sexes. This cutoff gradually increased by 2 g/dL in boys, but remained unchanged in girls up to age 19 years.

The age-specific and sex-specific haemoglobin cutoffs to define anaemia, from this secondary analysis of the CNNS, were lower throughout ages 1–19 years than the WHO recommended cutoffs. For both sexes and across the ages, the WHO cutoff was outside the 95% CI of this study's cutoffs (figure 3). The differences between the study and WHO cutoffs narrowed from approximately 2 g/dL at age 1 year to approximately 1 g/dL at age 6 years, with subsequent variations of 0.4–1.3 g/dL up to age 19 years. By contrast, in girls, the differences between the study and WHO cutoffs narrowed from approximately 1.7 g/dL at age 1 year to approximately 1 g/dL at age 5–6 years, with subsequent variations of 0.8–1.5 g/dL up to age 19 years.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^113D8qwA]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Anaemia develops when the red cell mass is insufficient to meet physiological oxygen-carrying needs and is usually formally diagnosed when the haemoglobin concentration falls below a defined threshold for age and sex. Accurate case definition of anaemia is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and for understanding the magnitude and distribution of this condition as a public health problem. WHO's anaemia definitions aim to reflect the lower fifth centile of the haemoglobin distribution of a reference population of healthy individuals. WHO thresholds were initially proposed in 1958, then updated in 1968, and have remained essentially unchanged since.WHO thresholds were based on studies with restricted measurement of biomarkers of iron and other forms of haematinic deficiency and inflammation. There is limited consensus on anaemia definitions, leading to heterogeneous definitions between sources, expert groups, and public health bodies, translating into inconsistent clinical definitions.

Establishing a valid diagnosis of anaemia is crucial for treating patients and detecting the range of diseases that could underlie this condition. Anaemia can cause clinical effects directly (eg, anaemia causes a substantial burden of disease); however, even in the absence of overt clinical effects, haemoglobin-based thresholds for anaemia are used as important triggers for investigation and optimisation of underlying contributors. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced by acute, recurrent, chronic medical or surgical illness. Inflammation (eg, due to autoimmune disease, infection, cancer, heart failure, and even obesity) suppresses erythropoiesis due to functional iron deficiency and might also reduce red cell survival. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced in renal impairment due to reduced erythropoietin production and functional iron deficiency. Many medications can reduce haemoglobin concentrations idiosyncratically or in a dose–dependent manner. Anaemia can persist weeks or months beyond an acute illness, and normalisation of acute inflammatory markers. Conversely, hypoxia (eg, smoking, respiratory or cardiac disease, obesity or sleep apnoea, or elevated altitude of residence)can increase haemoglobin concentrations. Diagnosis of anaemia lies at the centre of many clinical pathways, such as investigation of gastrointestinal bleeding, preoperative optimisation, screening for haemoglobinopathy, and eligibility for blood donation. Anaemia is an adverse prognostic factor for multiple conditions, including heart failure, major surgery, cancer, and HIV. Most patients admitted to hospital with critical illness are anaemic in hospital, and about half remain anaemic 6 monthsor even 12 months after hospital admission.

### Should hemoglobin be normalized in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^116UZMd7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

In the last decade the nephrology community has learned much about the impact of anemia on patients with kidney disease. Therapy of anemia can correct many of the symptoms which seriously compromise patient function. Despite the obvious benefits, controversy continues regarding the optimal target hemoglobin concentration both in patients prior to dialysis and in dialysis populations. In this editorial we review the clinical data that contribute to this controversy and the physiologic concepts underlying the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, we discuss the need to individualize hemoglobin targets for specific patient populations and the importance of early identification and treatment of anemia in patients with kidney disease. The economic impact of normalizing hemoglobin with the use of erythropoietin and intravenous or oral iron has affected clinical practice over the last decade. Current guidelines published by Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (KDOQI), the European Working Group on Anemia Management, and the Canadian Society of Nephrology all recommend target hemoglobin concentrations and thresholds for initiation of therapy and also suggest the need for reevaluation of current targets in light of new evidence. This editorial supports those guidelines and challenges the reader to critically evaluate current practice in the context of the accumulating data and the physiologic principles discussed herein. The therapy of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is an essential component of care in patients with CKD. However, the effects of therapy will be most impressive when accompanied by the optimal care of all hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with CKD.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^113SovAM]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, these are the first normative ranges of Hb values in pregnancy compatible with good, functional, maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as neonatal and early childhood morbidity, growth and development up to 2 years of age. The 3 rd - 97 th centile range for maternal Hb is large across gestational ages (around 94 to 141 g/L) clearly demonstrating that healthy pregnant women have adaptive mechanisms to achieve adequate health outcomes within a wide range of Hb values. The resource should, therefore, act as a simple narrative to communicate to mothers the meaning of their routine blood test results.

This work also provides a system, at the individual level, for defining normal Hb distributions based on gestational age-specific cut-offs (< 3 rd centile = low Hb concentration; 3rd - 4.99 th centile = high risk of low Hb concentration; 5 th - 9.99 th centile = moderate risk of low Hb concentration; ≥ 10 th centile = normal Hb concentration), an approach that is well accepted in biology and medicine. In addition, previous studies have suggested that high haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with increased pregnancy risks, including antepartum stillbirth and pre-eclampsia. However, these findings are inconsistent, and in part this may be due to using a fixed cut-offs for defining haemoconcentration despite different gestational ages at the time of blood sampling. We believe that studies in this field can be facilitated by our work by allowing uniformity in gestational-age specific definitions of both low and high haemoglobin concentrations.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1121y8V1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Anemia is a major global health challenge affecting an estimated quarter of the world's population, imposing a substantial burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic costs. Although iron deficiency remains the most frequently cited cause, the etiological landscape of anemia is remarkably diverse. It includes deficiencies of other micronutrients (e.g. vitamin B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease and thalassemia), and anemia of chronic disease. Women of reproductive age and young children are especially vulnerable, with iron deficiency anemia contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes, impaired cognitive development, and heightened susceptibility to infection. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are therefore pivotal to controlling this significant public health issue.

Diagnosing anemia, however, is far from straightforward. Hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs established by the World Health Organization (WHO) provide widely accepted thresholds for identifying anemia in the general population, yet these reference values were largely developed and validated in low‐altitude and high‐income settings. Such generalized classifications often fail to capture the complexities of diverse global populations, particularly individuals living in high‐altitude regions (> 2500 m). Due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude, an elevated Hb concentration is a normal physiological adaptation to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. When altitude‐dependent Hb correction cutoffs are applied in these environments, they can inadvertently inflate the prevalence of anemia, labeling many physiologically normal individuals as anemic.

4.3 Historical Evolution ofAdjustment Approaches for High‐Altitude Anemia Diagnosis

Over the decades, multiple formulas have been proposed to standardize Hb adjustments for altitude, yet no single approach has achieved universal acceptance (Table 1). This evolution traces back to the late 1950s and 1960s, when the WHO established universal anemia thresholds largely derived from sea‐level data. At that time, high‐altitude residents were underrepresented, even though their elevated Hb due to hypoxia was well documented. By 1989, WHO and other public health agencies formally recognized the need for altitude corrections, advocating an increase in the anemia cutoffs to account for higher baseline Hb. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, guidelines (e.g. WHO/UNICEF and CDC) introduced specific tables for altitude and smoking adjustment, typically adding a fixed increment to the anemia threshold depending on elevation. However, these methods were often based on limited empirical data, chiefly pre‐1985 studies of Andean men and U.S. children, raising concerns about their global applicability. In the years since, various data‐driven and physiologically modeled formulas have aimed to refine or replace these early corrections, but genetic, ethnic, and regional differences remain insufficiently captured. Most recently, in March 2024, the WHO released updated guidelines on Hb cutoffs for defining anemia in individuals and populations, introducing a revised equation for altitude adjustments starting at 500 m above sea level. This revision represents the culmination of extensive, multiyear reviews integrating diverse data sources, notably impacting anemia definitions for children aged 6–23 months, now established at Hb < 10.5 g/dL. The newly recommended equation modestly increases anemia prevalence at moderate elevations (between 500 and 3000 m) while reducing it at altitudes above 3500 m — an attempt to address earlier formulas' tendency to over‐ or under‐correct in certain regions. However, a concern with this guideline is that arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen transport do not vary significantly between 0 and 1500 m, and no symptoms are observed at these altitudes. According to the new guidelines, individuals living between 500 and 999 m should have their measured Hb value adjusted downward by 0.4 g/dL.

### Risk-adapted cutoffs in colorectal cancer screening by fecal immunochemical tests [^115mXjkk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin are increasingly used in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The use of uniform positivity thresholds (cutoffs) within screening populations is expected to imply lower positive predictive values (PPVs) and higher numbers of colonoscopies needed (numbers needed to scope [NNSs]) to detect advanced neoplasms among screening participants at lower risk compared with those at higher risk. We aimed to assess such variation and its potential implications in a large screening cohort.

Methods

A quantitative FIT (FOB Gold; Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) was conducted in fecal samples collected by 4,332 participants of screening colonoscopy before bowel preparation. Participants were classified into 3 risk groups (low, medium, and high) by tertiles of a previously derived risk-factor-based risk score. We determined the variation of PPVs and NNSs for detecting advanced neoplasms (i.e. CRC or advanced adenoma) when using the same FIT cutoffs and variation of FIT cutoffs that would yield uniform PPVs across risk groups.

Results

When a fixed FIT cutoff of 10 μg/g was used, the PPV increased from 23.3% to 41.8% from the low- to the high-risk group, with NNS decreasing from 4.3 to 2.4 (P < 0.001). Similar variations of PPVs and NNSs across risk groups were observed at higher FIT cutoffs. When risk group-specific cutoffs were defined to achieve fixed PPVs of 25%, 30%, and 35% across all risk groups, cutoffs varied from 5.3 to 11.4, 6.5 to 18.7, and 7.5 to 31.0 μg hemoglobin/g feces, respectively, between high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.05 for all differences).

Discussion

Using risk-adapted cutoffs may help to achieve target levels of PPV and NNS and might be an option to consider for personalized FIT-based CRC screening.

By cutoff

Summary estimates were created for the relationship of high Hb to post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, postpartum depression, prenatal depression, and maternal mortality by Hb concentration cutoff: ≥ 130, ≥ 140, and ≥ 150 g/L (Table 4). The odds of post-partum hemorrhage were similar and non-significant for the first two of these Hb cutoffs (≥ 130 g/L: (OR (95% CI) 1.00 (0.95–1.05)); ≥ 140 g/L (OR (95% CI) 1.00 (0.87–1.14)). The odds of pre-eclampsia were highest when Hb concentration was ≥ 150 g/L (OR (95% CI) 2.38 (1.20–4.69)) compared to a cutoff of ≥ 130 (OR (95% CI) 1.34 (1.16–1.56)). For gestational diabetes, ORs were significant for Hb ≥ 130 g/L (OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.19–2.46)) and ≥ 140 g/L (OR (95% CI) 2.10 (1.65–2.68)). Data were limited for other outcomes.

Approximately one-third of the global population is estimated to have anemia, a condition defined by hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations below specific cutoff points based on age, sex, and physiological status. Anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in pregnancy, with an estimated prevalence of 16% in the United States and 36% worldwide. During pregnancy, anemia is associated with an increased risk of delivery by cesarean section, low birth weight, preterm birth, perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and maternal mortality. Additionally, it may negatively impact neurodevelopment in offspring.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies anemia in pregnant women based on Hb concentration as severe anemia (< 70 g/L), moderate anemia (70–99 g/L), and mild anemia (100–109 g/L). Pregnant women with Hb ≥ 110 g/L are considered non-anemic. However, this classification has been criticized for relying on a limited number of studies conducted in pregnant women in Europe and North America, despite being uniformly applied across all geographical regions. These thresholds were originally derived from statistical cutoffs, defining anemia as an Hb level below the 5th percentile of normal values in pregnant women, without adequately considering the implications for maternal and offspring health. Recently, the WHO conducted a review of its global guidelines for Hb thresholds used to define anemia at both the individual and population levels. The review revealed that the current Hb cutoffs, including those for pregnant women, lack a robust evidence base. Updated WHO recommendations on Hb thresholds for defining anemia are expected to be announced in the future.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^115Z7omM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO anemia guidance — FDA labeling and hemoglobin (Hb) targets emphasize individualized ESA use and cautious lower bounds. The commentary notes, "The FDA emphasized that the Hb target range of 10 to 12 g/dL (100–120 g/L) should be replaced by the practice of using the lowest possible dose of ESA to prevent blood transfusions", and "The FDA now specifies that ESA therapy should be reduced or interrupted if the Hb level exceeds 11 g/dL (110 g/L), but that treatment of anemia in CKD with ESA therapy should be individualized". It states, "KDIGO recommends the initiation of ESA therapy for patients with CKD 5D (CKD stage 5 on dialysis) at the same threshold of less than 10 g/dL, as does the FDA, but adds the additional goal to avoid Hb falling below 9 g/dL", and that "the KDIGO guideline draws attention to the lower boundary of 9 g/dL Hb in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD". The authors caution, "We are concerned that the novel identification of a lower bound of 'acceptability' may increase use of blood transfusion", and add, "although we agree with reducing the Hb level at which ESAs should be reduced or discontinued to 11 g/dL, we recognize that there is a paucity of evidence that an Hb concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk". Regarding quality of life (QoL), evidence cited includes that "The double-blind Canadian normalization of hemoglobin trial… demonstrated that treatment with erythropoietin improves many QoL scores (comparing placebo with mean Hb of 7.4 g/dL to the 2 target arms of 9.5–11.0 and 11.5–13.0 g/dL)", whereas "a Canadian/European trial… reported that higher as compared to lower Hb concentration targets did not result in further positive QoL changes".

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: a British Society for Haematology guideline update [^111Na2Zi]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to correction of preoperative anemia (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view hemoglobin levels < 130 g/L as the threshold at which patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies and enhanced patient blood management measures.

### The prevalence of anaemia depends on the definition: an example from the aboriginal birth cohort study [^114DHhpN]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The cutoffs defining anaemia based on haemoglobin and haematocrit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States (US) are different. We compared the prevalences resulting from these definitions and explored the reasons for the variation observed.

Design

A cross-sectional survey within a cohort study of children recruited at birth at Royal Darwin Hospital.

Setting

Subjects were interviewed in their homes or other convenient location and had a blood sample drawn.

Subjects

Five hundred and seventeen Australian Aboriginal children aged 9–13 years inclusive.

Results

Depending on the criterion used, the prevalence of anaemia in the total group ranged between 6% (95% confidence interval: 4.1–8.4%) and 24.4% (20.7–28.3). Using the WHO criteria, girls aged 12–13 years were identified as a target group, having a two- to-six fold higher prevalence than the other groups. When compared to the US criteria, boys aged 12–13 years had the highest prevalence of anaemia, although this was not significant. Simulations show that the WHO cutoffs are based on inconsistent centiles of the age-sex haemoglobin and haematocrit distributions, and that this largely explains the discrepant results.

Conclusions

This variability in definition could lead to inappropriate identification of target groups for intervention programmes.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^115eXCjM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We defined a healthy population according to iron and vitamin A status, inflammation, and malaria, but were unable to examine other factors associated with anemia, such as inherited blood disorders (eg, sickle cell Hb or thalassemia diagnosed using red blood cell indices such as mean corpuscular volume, or direct laboratory assessment). In addition, some biomarkers of micronutrient status (eg, vitamin A, vitamin B 12, and folate) and reticulocyte Hb content transferrin saturation were either not available for all surveys or were not measured in any of the population-based surveys. Additional research is needed to examine Hb thresholds for other target groups (eg, younger children, pregnant women, or the elderly) and to further explore the potential utility of age-specific and sex-specific Hb cutoffs in children. The healthy inclusion criteria led to exclusion of a large proportion of data, highlighting widespread micronutrient deficiencies and inflammation. No clinical data from hospitals or medical records were used in this analysis, so we were unable to examine possible associations between Hb and clinical outcomes. Recognizing that the Hb-sTfR curve may represent a biological relationship, we acknowledge that thresholds for anemia based on detrimental health and functional outcomes (eg, exacerbation of underlying clinical conditions, reduced work capacity, fatigue, sleep disturbance, prematurity or low birth weight, or impaired child cognitive development) would advance the field.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on anemia in pregnancy, to reduce the incidence and impact of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [^11579Thy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects 32 million pregnant women globally, contributing annually to more than 115000 maternal deaths and 591000 perinatal deaths worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of anemia in pregnancy, with nearly 50% of affected pregnant women. It is now 2025, which is WHO's target year for a 50% reduction in maternal anemia, and the global prevalence of anemia in pregnancy remains more than twice the target of 15%. This calls for a renewed global focus on optimal approaches for reducing the burden and complications of anemia in pregnancy. In this FIGO Childbirth and Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Committee paper, current best evidence on anemia in pregnancy has been reviewed and synthesized, to make recommendations on screening, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of anemia in pregnancy. We recommend that all pregnant women should be screened for anemia in pregnancy at booking and again at 28weeks of pregnancy, with a full blood count (FBC), or packed cell volume/hemoglobin concentration in settings where FBC is not available. A hemoglobin concentration cutoff of less than 11g/dL in all trimesters of pregnancy and during the postpartum period, as well as in all settings and populations, is recommended for the diagnosis of anemia in pregnancy. Routine iron and folic acid supplementation, either alone, or as components of multiple micronutrient supplements, is also recommended during pregnancy. We also made recommendations for malaria and anti-helminthic chemoprophylaxis, hemoglobinopathy screening, iron, folate, and multiple micronutrient supplementation, and blood transfusion in pregnant women with hemoglobinopathies. Finally, the relationship between anemia and postpartum hemorrhage is highlighted.

### Maternal low and high hemoglobin concentrations and associations with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159H5d1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

By cutoff

Summary estimates were constructed for low Hb and the odds of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, postpartum depression, prenatal depression, and maternal mortality by Hb concentration cutoff (Table 3). The odds of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion and pre-eclampsia increased as Hb concentration decreased with a 1.8 to 11.8-fold increase in ORs when shifting from a cutoff of ≤ 110 g/L to a cutoff of ≤ 70 g/L. For maternal mortality, while the overall results for ≤ 110 g/L were non-significant, at lower cutoffs of ≤ 100 (OR (95% CI) 2.87 (1.08–7.67)), and ≤ 90 (OR (95% CI) 4.83 (2.17–10.74)) relationships were significant.

High maternal hb and maternal outcomes

Data across time points and cutoffs were combined to construct summary estimates of the relationship of high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) to postpartum hemorrhage, maternal mortality, transfusion, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, prenatal depression, and postpartum depression (Fig. 3 b). When all data were combined, high Hb (≥ 130 g/L) was significantly associated with odds of maternal mortality (OR (95% CI) 2.01 (1.12–3.61)), gestational diabetes (OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.19–2.46)), and pre-eclampsia (OR (95% CI) 1.34 (1.16–1.56)).

By timing

Limited data were available to examine associations of high maternal Hb with maternal outcomes. During preconception, high maternal Hb was associated with increased odds of gestational diabetes (OR (95% CI) 1.24 (1.11–1.38)) but data were not available for other outcomes. During the first trimester, high maternal Hb was associated with increased odds of gestational diabetes (OR (95% CI) 1.73 (1.10–2.71)). During the second and third trimester, high maternal Hb was associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia (OR (95% CI) 1.27 (1.18–1.36)).

### Serum ferritin threshold for iron deficiency screening in one-year-old children [^116tp5Hq]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal hemoglobin screening for iron deficiency anemia using hemoglobin < 110 g/L at the 1-year-old well child visit. Our retrospective study suggests the need for combined hemoglobin and serum ferritin iron deficiency screening and raising the diagnostic serum ferritin threshold to 24–25 μg/L.

### Fecal hemoglobin levels in prior negative screening and detection of colorectal neoplasia: a dose-response meta-analysis [^115KvcTZ]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Prior studies have shown that individuals with fecal hemoglobin (f-Hb) concentrations just below the positivity cutoff have an increased colorectal cancer risk compared with those with no or low f-Hb. Understanding the dose-response association between f-Hb in a prior screening round and the detection of colorectal neoplasia is crucial for tailoring risk-based screening recommendations.

Methods

We searched the literature to identify studies reporting the association between f-Hb in prior screening round and colorectal neoplasia detection in an average-risk population. Analysis involved a 2-stage approach using log-log regression models to assess dose-response relationships across studies, with effect sizes pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by excluding individual studies in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses examined variations in effects by outcome definitions and detection methods.

Results

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 13 studies with 4,493,672 individuals. All studies demonstrated a positive association between f-Hb in prior screenings and colorectal neoplasia detection. Pooled analysis revealed that individuals with f-Hb concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/g had a 3-, 5-, 8-, and 13-fold higher risk of colorectal neoplasia, respectively, compared with individuals with 0 μg/g. Although significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 97.5%, P < .001) was observed, sensitivity analyses confirmed the consistency of findings. Subgroup analyses indicated that f-Hb concentrations from previous negative tests were especially predictive of advanced neoplasia in subsequent screenings.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the risk of detecting colorectal neoplasia increases with prior f-Hb concentrations in negative tests, supporting the development of risk-stratified screening strategies based on these concentrations.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^115BApDn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

World Health Organization (WHO) hemoglobin thresholds — definition and severity cutoffs in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are specified with hemoglobin (Hgb) in g/dL. Hgb is expressed as grams per deciliter (g/dL). After menarche, the cutoff Hgb in women is 12 g/dL. For children younger than 5 years and pregnant women, a Hgb level below 7 g/dL is deemed as severe anemia. Table values for ages 5–11 years specify healthy ≥ 11.5 g/dL, mild anemia 11–11.4 g/dL, moderate anemia 8–10.9 g/dL, and severe anemia < 8 g/dL.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^117VSpoi]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Detection of anaemia is crucial for clinical medicine and public health. Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago. We sought to establish evidence for the statistical haemoglobin thresholds for anaemia that can be applied globally and inform WHO and clinical guidelines.

Methods

In this analysis we identified international data sources from populations in the United States, England, Australia, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Ecuador, and Bangladesh with sufficient clinical and laboratory information collected between 1998 and 2020 to obtain a healthy reference sample. Individuals with clinical or biochemical evidence of a condition that could reduce haemoglobin concentrations were excluded. We estimated haemoglobin thresholds (ie, 5th centiles) for children aged 6–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–11 years, and 12–17 years, and adults aged 18–65 years (including during pregnancy) for individual datasets and pooled across data sources. We also collated findings from three large-scale genetic studies to summarise genetic variants affecting haemoglobin concentrations in different ancestral populations.

Findings

We identified eight data sources comprising 18 individual datasets that were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. In pooled analyses, the haemoglobin fifth centile was 104.4 g/L (90% CI 103.5–105.3) in 924 children aged 6–23 months, 110.2 g/L (109.5–110.9) in 1874 children aged 24–59 months, and 114.4 g/L (113.6–115.2) in 1839 children aged 5–11 years. Values diverged by sex in adolescents and adults. In pooled analyses, the fifth centile was 122.2 g/L (90% CI 121.3–123.1) in 1741 female adolescents aged 12–17 years and 128.2 g/L (126.4–130.0) in 1103 male adolescents aged 12–17 years. In pooled analyses of adults aged 18–65 years, the fifth centile was 119.7 g/L (90% CI 119.1–120.3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134.9 g/L (134.2–135.6) in 2377 males. Fifth centiles in pregnancy were 110.3 g/L (90% CI 109.5–111.0) in the first trimester (n = 772) and 105.9 g/L (104.0–107.7) in the second trimester (n = 111), with insufficient data for analysis in the third trimester. There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

Interpretation

Our results enable global harmonisation of clinical and public health haemoglobin thresholds for diagnosis of anaemia. Haemoglobin thresholds are similar between sexes until adolescence, after which males have higher thresholds than females. We did not find any evidence that thresholds should differ between people of differering ancestries.

### Anemia in pregnant women: findings from Kuwait birth cohort study [^115YzsUV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The Hb threshold used to define anemia has a significant impact on both public health programs and clinical decision-making. While we selected Hb cutoff point for defining anemia in pregnant women in accordance with the standards set by most organizations, including the WHO, CDC, and ACOG, the appropriateness of this cutoff point has been repeatedly questioned. The Hb threshold below which maternal and/or offspring adverse health outcomes occur remains uncertain. Recently, using multinational data, Addo et al. proposed lowering the Hb cutoff point for defining anemia by 1.35 g/dL in children and 1.19 g/dL in nonpregnant women. Several researchers have also suggested reducing the threshold for these demographic groups, although no similar work has been conducted for pregnant women. In our setting, reducing the Hb threshold by 5 g/L (0.5 g/dL) subsequently decreased the prevalence of anemia to only 15.1%. This new cutoff point aligned with the one used in the UK during the third trimester, which is 105 g/L (10.5 g/dL). This observation underscores that even minor adjustments to the Hb cutoff point can significantly impact the estimated burden of anemia. It highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to establish an evidence-based Hb cutoff point to enable accurate assessment of anemia burden and facilitate comparisons across different settings and time periods.

### Haemoglobin diagnostic cut-offs for anaemia in Indian women of reproductive age [^111FGaUJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The persistent high prevalence of anaemia among Indian women of reproductive age (WRA) despite aggressive long-term iron supplementation could be related to over-diagnosis from an inappropriately high haemoglobin (Hb) diagnostic cut-off. To develop an appropriate cut-off for Indian WRA, we hypothesized that during iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation to a mixed (anaemic/non-anaemic) WRA population, the positive slope of the Hb-plasma ferritin (PF) response in anaemic women would inflect into a plateau (zero-response) as a non-anaemic status is reached. The 2.5th percentile of the Hb distribution at this inflection point will be the diagnostic Hb cut-off for iron-responsive anaemia.

Method

A hierarchical mixed effects model, with a polynomial mean and variance model to account for intraclass correlation due to repeated measures, was used to estimate the response curve of Hb to PF, or body iron stores, in anaemic and non-anaemic WRA (without inflammation), who were receiving a 90-day IFA supplementation.

Results

The Hb response curve at low PF values showed a steep increase, which inflected into a plateau at a PF of 10.1 µg/L and attained a steady state at a PF of 20.6 µg/L. The Hb distribution at the inflection was a normal probability distribution, with a mean of 12.3 g/dL. The 2.5th percentile value of this distribution, or the putative diagnostic Hb cut-off for anaemia, was 10.8 g/dL (~11 g/dL).

Conclusion

The derived Hb cut-off is lower than the current adult values of 12 g/dL and could partly explain the persistently high prevalence of anaemia.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^114Rx8E2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for anemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 11 of the 61 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that a therapeutic trial of iron is appropriate in cases in which a reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dosage or avoidance of ESA and transfusion is desired, transferrin saturations are > 30%, and ferritin concentrations are > 500 μg/L. However, we concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support an upper target or threshold for ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. We agree with the initiation of ESA treatment when hemoglobin (Hb) level is 90–100 g/L; however, we specifically state that an acceptable range for Hb level is 95–115 g/L, with a target of 100–110 g/L, and add caution to individualization above this range due to concerns regarding the safety of ESAs. We agree that ESAs should be used with considerable caution in patients with active malignancy, history of stroke, or history of malignancy, and we suggest initiating ESA therapy at Hb level of 90 g/L and to aim for a Hb level in the range of 90–105 g/L. The reader is encouraged to note the level of evidence and review the entire KDIGO anemia guideline to interpret the guideline statements and commentary appropriately.

Summary

Background

Detection of anaemia is crucial for clinical medicine and public health. Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago.

In pooled analyses, the fifth centile was 122.2 g/L (90% CI 121.3–123.1) in 1741 female adolescents aged 12–17 years and 128.2 g/L (126.4–130.0) in 1103 male adolescents aged 12–17 years. In pooled analyses of adults aged 18–65 years, the fifth centile was 119.7 g/L (90% CI 119.1–120.3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134.9 g/L (134.2–135.6) in 2377 males. Fifth centiles in pregnancy were 110.3 g/L (90% CI 109.5–111.0) in the first trimester (n = 772) and 105.9 g/L (104.0–107.7) in the second trimester (n = 111), with insufficient data for analysis in the third trimester. There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^1125nct2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and data sources

To support clinical and public health guidelines we sought to establish thresholds for children, adolescents, adult men, and adult women including pregnant women (by trimester). We aimed to define the lower fifth centile of the distribution among healthy individuals (ie, a healthy reference population). Central to the design of the analysis was the need to establish a reference population from existing datasets (posteriori approach) through exclusion of individuals with evidence of conditions or circumstances that could influence haemoglobin concentration. We searched for datasets comprising appropriate clinical and laboratory information to enable post-hoc derivation of an apparently healthy reference sample; this approach included assessing national health surveys (using the search terms "country name" AND "national health database") and prospective clinical cohorts, with a focus on countries where malaria was not endemic (ie, with low background inflammation) between May, 2021, and September, 2022 (further details are provided in the appendix, p 5).

Although exclusion criteria were standardised, the available data and their coding varied between studies (eg, in classification of ancestry, consumption of alcohol, terminology, or questions about history of illness). Studies were only selected if both clinical and laboratory data were available. The specific nature of clinical data varied between surveys, and within each survey all available clinical parameters relevant to anaemia were used. This approach resulted in heterogeneous exclusion criteria between surveys, but the optimal healthy population within each survey. Clinical criteria for exclusion included reporting of chronic systemic medical illness; any recent acute illness (2–4 weeks); recent hospital admission (up to 12 months); use of medications (excluding hormonal contraception where possible); current smoking or excess alcohol consumption; and obesity or low bodyweight (ascertained by BMI cutoffs). Where data were available, we excluded individuals living at elevations above 750 m. Missing clinical criteria were not applied as exclusions, except for pregnancy.

### Redefining normal hemoglobin and anemia in singleton and twin pregnancies [^111R3DGq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the benefit of a hemoglobin cutoff of 105 g/L as a trigger for anemia evaluation during the second trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

The present cross-sectional study, conducted at a health center in Israel between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, included pregnant women with hemoglobin values below 105 g/L who were assessed for anemia. Anemia workup included complete blood count, serum ferritin and vitamin B12 measurements, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. The primary outcome was the incidence of nondilutional anemia, defined by a positive workup, across predefined hemoglobin thresholds. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created to identify the best hemoglobin threshold for predicting anemia, mandating further evaluation.

Results

In total, 651 women with singleton and 300 women with twin pregnancies were evaluated for nondilutional anemia. Of these, 340 (52.2%) and 127 (42.3%) women, respectively, had positive workup results. The most common cause was iron deficiency. The hemoglobin values that best predicted positive workup results were 100 g/L in singleton pregnancies and 97 g/L in twin pregnancies.

Conclusion

Anemia evaluation could be unnecessary in pregnant women with a hemoglobin value of 100–105 g/L. Consideration should be given to redefining anemia in singleton and twin pregnancies.

Rationale

The Renal Association (RA) and Royal College of Physicians endorse the NICE Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Managing Anaemia. The reader is referred to these guidelines as well as the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) for Anaemia in CKD and the KDOQI Guidelines for management of anaemia in CKD. The

KDIGO website is a useful site of reference for comparison of evidence based guidelines internationally.

Anaemia is defined as having a Hb value below the established cut off defined by the World Health Organisation. Different defined groups have different cut offs. For adults:
Men and postmenopausal women Hb < 130 g/L
Premenopausal women Hb < 120 g/L

In 2006, KDOQI modified this definition by giving a single criterion for diagnosing anaemia in adult males (Hb < 135 g/L, regardless of age) because the decrease in Hb among males aged > 60 years is often attributable to associated co-morbidities, while KDIGO suggest a diagnosis of anaemia in adults with CKD when the Hb concentration is < 130 g/L in males and < 120 g/L in females.

Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin concentration less than the 5th percentile for age. Hb levels vary by age, and many laboratories use adult norms as references; therefore, the patient's Hb level must be compared with age-based norms to diagnose anaemia.

In addition to gender, age and pregnancy other factors influence Hb level including smoking, altitude, race and genetic disorders (thalassemia and sickle cell disease). In CKD a patient's anaemia should be defined using these same criteria. The degree of renal impairment affects the likelihood of any patient developing anaemia. Although current treatment with ESAs is not recommended unless Hb falls consistently below 110 g/L, other causes of anaemia should be excluded in patients with Hb below normal range. The current definition for anaemia applies to adult patients older than 18 years, of all races and ethnic groups, and living at relatively low altitude (< 1000 m or 3000 ft.). With increasing altitude, endogenous erythropoietin production is increased; as a result, Hb concentration can be expected to increase by about 6 g/L in women and 9 g/L in men for each 1000 m of altitude above sea level.

Intrauterine transfusion — hematocrit targets and thresholds — In general, the final target hematocrit should be approximately 40 — 50%. If the fetal hematocrit is greater than 30%, no transfusion is necessary, although a resampling may be recommended within 1 — 2 weeks, depending on the clinical circumstances, and transfusion to higher levels has been associated with a theoretical increased risk of complications.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^111nHquB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease hemoglobin target — ESA dosing and achieved Hb relative to targets: 10% to 16% dose changes can be an effective maintenance dose-titration strategy; holding ESA doses may lead to steep downward Hb excursions and high amplitude Hb cycling; imposing a fixed 25% dose decrease in response to greater-than-target Hb levels appears to promote greater Hb variability and more greater-than-target Hb values. In practice, when the target Hb is 11 g/dL or greater or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achievement of Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range is associated with lower mortality and less frequent hospitalization rates compared with achievement of lower Hb levels, and the same inverse relationship was seen in RCTs within assigned treatment arms (including arms with targets ≥ 13 g/dL); however, failure to show between-group benefits confirms that the relationship is not causal. The results are consistent with the conclusion that when the target Hb is greater than 11.0 g/dL or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achieved Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range do not constitute increased risk to patients; in general, higher facility- and country-specific achieved mean Hb and a lower percentage below target are associated with increased ESA use, and adjustment for ESA dose administered does not diminish the relationship between baseline Hb and mortality or hospitalization risk.

### Effects of increasing screening age and fecal hemoglobin cutoff concentrations in a colorectal cancer screening program [^116UibHq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Several countries have implemented programs to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC) by using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). These programs vary considerably in age of the population screened and the cutoff concentration of fecal hemoglobin (Hb) used to identify candidates for further evaluation; these variations are usually based on a country's colonoscopy resources. We calculated how increasing the Hb cutoff concentration and screening age affects colonoscopy yield, missed lesions, and demand.

Methods

We collected data from 10,008 average-risk individuals in The Netherlands, 50–74 years old, who were invited for an FIT in the first round of a population-based CRC screening program from November 2006 through December 2008. Fecal samples were collected, and levels of Hb were measured by using the OC-sensor Micro analyzer; concentrations ≥ 10μgHb/g feces were considered positive. Subjects with a positive FIT were scheduled for colonoscopy within 4 weeks. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between age and detection of advanced neoplasia.

Results

In total, 5986 individuals (62%) participated in the study; 503 (8.4%) had a positive test result. Attendance, positive test results, detection of advanced neoplasia, and the FIT's positive predictive value all increased significantly with age (P < .001). Detection of advanced neoplasia ranged from 1.3% in the youngest age group to 6.2% in the oldest group; the positive predictive value of the FIT was 26% in the youngest group and 47% in the oldest group. Increasing the starting age of invitees from 50–74 years to 55–74 years reduced the proportion of subjects who underwent colonoscopy evaluation by 14% and resulted in 9% more subjects with advanced neoplasia being missed. Increasing the cutoff concentration from 10 to 15 μg Hb/g feces reduced the proportion of subjects who underwent colonoscopy evaluation by 11% and resulted in 6% of advanced neoplasia being missed.

Conclusions

In an analysis of an average-risk screening population in The Netherlands, we found that detection of advanced neoplasia by FIT increases significantly with age and fecal Hb cutoff concentration. Increasing the cutoff concentration or screening age reduces the numbers of patients who undergo colonoscopy evaluation in FIT-based CRC screening programs. Our findings provide insight in these effects per age category and cutoff concentration and the consequences in terms of missed lesions.

### Effect of sex, age, and positivity threshold on fecal immunochemical test accuracy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nwdk2]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Quantitative fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin are commonly used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We aimed to quantify the change in CRC and advanced adenoma detection and number of positive test results at different positivity thresholds and by sex and age.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE, selecting articles of FIT for CRC detection in asymptomatic adults undergoing screening. We calculated sensitivity and specificity, as well as detected number of cancers, advanced adenomas, and positive test results at positivity thresholds ≤ 10 μg hemoglobin/g feces, 10 to ≤ 20 μg/g, 20 to ≤ 30 μg/g, and > 30 μg/g. We also analyzed results from stratified by patient sex, age, and reference standard.

Results

Our meta-analysis comprised 46 studies with 2.4 million participants and 6478 detected cancers. Sensitivity for detection of CRC increased from 69% (95% confidence interval, 63%-75%) at thresholds > 10 μg/g and ≤ 20 μg/g to 80% (95% CI, 76%-83%) at thresholds ≤ 10 μg/g. At these threshold values, sensitivity for detection of advanced adenomas increased from 21% (95% CI, 18%-25%) to 31% (95% CI, 27%-35%), whereas specificity decreased from 94% (95% CI, 93%-96%) to 91% (95% CI, 89%-93%). In 3 studies stratified by sex, sensitivity of CRC detection was 77% in men (95% CI, 75%-79%) and 81% in women (95% CI, 60%-100%) (P = 0.68). In 3 studies stratified by age groups, sensitivity of CRC detection was 85% for ages 50–59 years (95% CI, 71%-99%) and 73% for ages 60–69 years (95% CI, 71%-75%) (P = 0.10). All studies with colonoscopy follow-up had similar sensitivity levels for detection of CRC to studies that analyzed 2-year registry follow-up data (74%; 95% CI, 68%-78% vs 75%; 95% CI, 73%-77%).

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of studies that analyzed detection of CRC and advanced adenomas at different FIT positivity thresholds, we found the sensitivity and specificity of detection to vary with positive cutoff value. It might be possible to decrease positive threshold values for centers with sufficient follow-up colonoscopy resources. More research is needed to precisely establish FIT thresholds for each sex and age subgroup.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^112Vvy15]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We estimated the fifth centile of haemoglobin concentration in derived reference populations of healthy children, adolescents, and adults, to estimate statistical thresholds to define anaemia across the lifecycle. Analyses of genetic associations with haemoglobin concentration across different ancestries show no evidence of the presence of any non-clinically significant high-frequency variants. Collectively, our analyses guide a single set of global definitions for anaemia.

Statistical definitions for anaemia differ between adult women and men, with the haemoglobin threshold in women robust to sensitivity analyses based on higher ferritin thresholds (eg, < 45 μg/L) to indicate iron deficiency. Thresholds between sexes diverge in adolescence, increasing in males. Testosterone concentrations are higher in men than in women, and appear to drive correspondingly higher haemoglobin concentrations. A direct effect of testosterone has been observed in previous studies: for example, androgen deprivation in men causes a fall in haemoglobin concentrations that recovers when inhibition is reversed. Despite the same pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentration, male patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia have higher erythropoiesis (eg, soluble transferrin receptor and reticulocyte concentrations) than female patients. Thus, our data do not support proposals that statistical thresholds to define anaemia should be similar between adult men and women, although it is important to recognise that in some studies, similarly reduced haemoglobin concentrations in both sexes have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Future prospective studies with careful consideration of iron status (beyond ferritin), hormone concentrations, and menstrual blood loss are essential to understand the separation of haemoglobin thresholds by sex.

Our analyses were able to incorporate data from children across a broad age range. Our results highlight the increase in haemoglobin concentration and hence threshold for anaemia that occurs across childhood, and especially in early life. Thresholds based on arbitrary age bands are possibly crude and necessitate jarring changes in the definition of anaemia as children grow and develop. Our data suggest the existing single categorisation at age 6–59 months used by WHO is too broad and suggest at least dividing this population into two smaller subcategories (eg, age 6–23 months and 24–59 months). Definitions of anaemia in male and female children can be combined until adolescence. Recent analyses sought to evaluate the effects of reduced haemoglobin concentrations on pregnancy outcomes, and interestingly indicated an increased risk of preterm birth at haemoglobin thresholds below the statistical thresholds proposed here.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### International values for haemoglobin distributions in healthy pregnant women [^111sujdV]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Anaemia in pregnancy is a global nutritional problem associated with increased risks of maternal mortality, Caesarean section, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age, preterm birth, and perinatal and neonatal mortality. It is estimated that, in 2016, 40% of pregnant women (95% CI: 36.4 to 44.7%) had anaemia globally, with the highest prevalence in the WHO regions of South-East Asia (58.2%) and the lowest in the Americas (25.5%). As of 2020, prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years, by pregnancy status (percentage) is considered as an indicator to assess progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by the United Nations Statistical Commissionand reported in the World Health Statistics 2020. Achieving a 50% reduction in anaemia among women 15–49 years of age is relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goaland World Health Organization (WHO) global nutrition target for 2025.

In 1958, a WHO Study Working Group on Iron Deficiency Anaemia met in Geneva, Switzerland and determined that, for adult pregnant women, haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations below 100 g/L were indicative of anaemia. This cut-off was based on the analysis of haematological data derived from studies of apparently normal populations and was intended for use in nutritional surveys in different parts of the world. In 1967, WHO defined maternal anaemia as an Hb concentration below 110 g/L at any gestational age. Other thresholds were suggested by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expert clinical organisations, and individual clinical and research laboratories. WHO currently recommends Hb cut-offs below which individual women should be defined as anaemic, by trimester of pregnancy (first trimester: < 110 g/L; second trimester: < 105 g/L; third trimester: < 110 g/L). WHO also considers a normal Hb range in women by trimester as the assessment basis for blood transfusion, when needed.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^112NjXjk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

DEFINING ANEMIA THRESHOLDS IN MEN AND WOMEN

The WHO definition of anemia uses different Hb thresholds for men and women, but these differences are based largely on population averages for all adults, rather than on specific clinical outcomes related to Hb values < 12 g/dl for women and < 13 g/dl for men. According to the WHO criteria, the prevalence of anemia increases with advancing age to a greater extent in men than in womenas a result of different sex‐related thresholds for diagnosis. However, there is little metabolic or physiological rationale for a different threshold between postmenopausal women and older men. Importantly, women with a Hb concentration between 12.0 and 13.0 g/dl (anemic in men but not in women, according to the WHO definition) experienced a significantly lower QOL than women with Hb > 13 g/dl. Mild anemia, estimated to affect 11.1% in the population over the age of 65, is defined by WHO criteria as Hb levels of 11.0–11.9 in women and 11.0–12.9 g/dl in men. The differences in these ranges (0.9 g/dl in women vs 1.9 g/dl in men) result in different therapeutic guidelines, potentially leading to undertreatment of older women with anemia. Recently, Simonsick et al.examined fatigue and anemia in a cohort of older men and women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. They reported that even subclinical anemia, defined as Hb of 12–12.9 g/dl for women and 13–13.9 g/dl for men, was associated with fatigability. They also demonstrated that fatigability was predictive of subsequent clinical anemia. The observation that reduced QOL is observed in older women with Hb values up to 13 g/dl implies that the threshold for anemia in postmenopausal women should be similar to that in men. Such a change in diagnostic criteria would allow mild anemia in older people to be defined in the same range, and to be treated according to the same guidelines, in both sexes.

### Severity of anemia during pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^1134WNkA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most widespread nutritional deficiency among pregnant females in the world. According to the latest report of the World Health Organization, in most countries, the prevalence of anemia among pregnant and nonpregnant females aged 15 to 49 years increased from 2012 to 2016. The current worldwide progress is not on track in terms of achieving the nutrition target set by the 65th World Health Assembly, which is aiming for a 50% reduction in anemia prevalence among females of reproductive age by 2025. A total of 40.05% of pregnant females worldwide had anemia during pregnancy in 2016, with the highest prevalence (48.15%) in Southeast Asia. Because of the high prevalence of anemia, any adverse maternal and fetal outcomes associated with anemia during pregnancy would have a great public health impact.

The World Health Organizationrecommends the definition of severe, moderate, and mild anemia for pregnant women as hemoglobin concentrations of less than 70 g/L, 70 to 99, and 100 to 109 g/L (to convert g/L to g/dL, divide by 10.0), respectively. Although studieshave reported adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with anemia during pregnancy, the associations may vary when the severity of anemia is considered. Several studies, reported similar or even lower risks of low birthweight and stillbirth in pregnant females with mild anemia compared with those who had normal hemoglobin concentrations. Some guidelineshave recommended a hemoglobin cutoff lower than 110 g/L to define anemia during pregnancy; however, these recommendations still lack evidence and further work is needed to validate them. Furthermore, because of the large sample size requirements, little is known regarding the association between maternal anemia and rare adverse outcomes such as maternal death. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the association between the severity of anemia during pregnancy and the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes through a retrospective cohort analysis of 18 948 443 pregnant females in China.

### Fecal hemoglobin and calprotectin are equally effective in identifying patients with inflammatory bowel disease with active endoscopic inflammation [^111e6PD4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal calprotectin can be used as a noninvasive tool to assess inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the diagnostic accuracy of calprotectin is modest, and therefore additional markers are needed. We compared the efficacy of fecal hemoglobin and calprotectin as markers for endoscopic inflammation in patients with IBD.

Methods

Consecutive patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy collected a stool sample before bowel preparation. Experienced endoscopists assessed the presence of inflammation in each colonic segment. Fecal calprotectin and hemoglobin were analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operator characteristic statistics were used to determine cutoff values for calprotectin and hemoglobin.

Results

A total of 176 surveillance colonoscopies were performed in 164 patients, of which 83 patients had Crohn's disease, 74 had ulcerative colitis, and 7 IBD-unclassified. Median (interquartile range) calprotectin and hemoglobin concentrations were 137 mg/kg (interquartile range, 33–494) and 0.51 μg/g (interquartile range, 0.18–8.50), respectively. For calprotectin, a cutoff value of 140 mg/kg predicted endoscopic inflammation with 86% sensitivity, 72% specificity, 64% positive predictive value, 90% negative predictive value, and an area under the curve of 0.87. For hemoglobin, a cutoff value of 1.51 μg/g indicated endoscopic inflammation with 74% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 72% positive predictive value, 84% negative predictive value, and an area under the curve of 0.81. Combining both tests did not increase the predictive accuracy substantially compared with calprotectin or hemoglobin alone (area under the curve, 0.88).

Conclusions

Fecal hemoglobin can identify patients with IBD with active inflammation with a predictive accuracy similar to calprotectin.

### Hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion in young children hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia [^1176NxNR]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations advise against blood transfusion in hemodynamically stable children with iron deficiency anemia. In an observational study of 125 children aged 6 through 36 months, hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia, we found that hemoglobin level predicted red blood cell transfusion (area under the curve 0.8862). A hemoglobin of 39 g/L had sensitivity 92% and specificity 72% for transfusion.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115s12Mi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia guidelines — hemoglobin targets and transfusion — state that the selected hemoglobin (Hb) target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL and that the Hb target should not be above 13.0 g/dL; they also state that no single Hb concentration justifies or requires transfusion and that the target Hb should not serve as a transfusion trigger. The epoetin alfa prescribing information lists when administered to target a Hb > 12 g/dL and that the Hb concentration should not exceed 12 g/dL, while labeling lists Hb < 10 g/dL as a starting Hb in chronic kidney disease. The guideline notes that selection of Hb target and selection of Hb level to initiate therapy are separate but related steps in medical decision-making and that to avoid achieved Hb > 12 g/dL would require a Hb target as low as 9.2 g/dL.

### Fecal occult blood testing when colonoscopy capacity is limited [^116CxSUV]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) can be adapted to a limited colonoscopy capacity by narrowing the age range or extending the screening interval, by using a more specific test or hemoglobin cutoff level for referral to colonoscopy, and by restricting surveillance colonoscopy. Which of these options is most clinically effective and cost-effective has yet to be established.

Methods

We used the validated MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model to estimate the number of colonoscopies, costs, and health effects of different screening strategies using guaiac FOBT or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) at various hemoglobin cutoff levels between 50 and 200 ng hemoglobin per mL, different surveillance strategies, and various age ranges. We optimized the allocation of a limited number of colonoscopies on the basis of incremental cost-effectiveness.

Results

When colonoscopy capacity was unlimited, the optimal screening strategy was to administer an annual FIT with a 50 ng/mL hemoglobin cutoff level in individuals aged 45–80 years and to offer colonoscopy surveillance to all individuals with adenomas. When colonoscopy capacity was decreasing, the optimal screening adaptation was to first increase the FIT hemoglobin cutoff value to 200 ng hemoglobin per mL and narrow the age range to 50–75 years, to restrict colonoscopy surveillance, and finally to further decrease the number of screening rounds. FIT screening was always more cost-effective compared with guaiac FOBT. Doubling colonoscopy capacity increased the benefits of FIT screening up to 100%.

Conclusions

FIT should be used at higher hemoglobin cutoff levels when colonoscopy capacity is limited compared with unlimited and is more effective in terms of health outcomes and cost compared with guaiac FOBT at all colonoscopy capacity levels. Increasing the colonoscopy capacity substantially increases the health benefits of FIT screening.

### Preoperative risk management programs at the top 50 orthopaedic institutions frequently enforce strict cutoffs for BMI and hemoglobin A1c which may limit access to total joint arthroplasty and provide limited resources for smoking cessation and dental care [^1136pXJM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Performing elective orthopaedic surgery on patients with high BMI, poorly controlled hyperglycemia, and who use tobacco can lead to serious complications. Some surgeons use cutoffs for BMI, hemoglobin A1c, and cigarette smoking to limit surgery to patients with lower risk profiles rather than engaging in shared decision-making with patients about those factors. Other studies have suggested this practice may discriminate against people of lower income levels and women. However, the extent to which this practice approach is used by orthopaedic surgeons at leading hospitals is unknown.

Questions/Purposes

(1) How often are preoperative cutoffs for hemoglobin A1c and BMI used at the top US orthopaedic institutions? (2) What services are available at the top orthopaedic institutions for weight loss, smoking cessation, and dental care? (3) What proportion of hospital-provided weight loss clinics, smoking cessation programs, and dental care clinics accept Medicaid insurance?

Methods

To investigate preoperative cutoffs for hemoglobin A1c and BMI and patient access to nonorthopaedic specialists at the top orthopaedic hospitals in the United States, we collected data on the top 50 orthopaedic hospitals in the United States as ranked by the 2020 US News and World Report 's "Best Hospitals for Orthopedics" list. We used a surgeon-targeted email survey to ascertain information regarding the use of preoperative cutoffs for hemoglobin A1c and BMI and availability and insurance acceptance policies of weight loss and dental clinics. Surgeons were informed that the survey was designed to assess how their institution manages preoperative risk management. The survey was sent to one practicing arthroplasty surgeon, the chair of the arthroplasty service, or department chair, whenever possible, at the top 50 orthopaedic institutions. Reminder emails were sent periodically to encourage participation from nonresponding institutions. We received survey responses from 70% (35 of 50) of hospitals regarding the use of preoperative hemoglobin A1c and BMI cutoffs. There was no difference in the response rate based on hospital ranking or hospital region. Fewer responses were received regarding the availability and Medicaid acceptance of weight loss and dental clinics. We used a "secret shopper" methodology (defined as when a researcher calls a facility pretending to be a patient seeking care) to gather information from hospitals directly. The use of deception in this study was approved by our institution's institutional review board. We called the main telephone line at each institution and spoke with the telephone operator at each hospital asking standardized questions regarding the availability of medical or surgical weight loss clinics, smoking cessation programs, and dental clinics. When possible, researchers were referred directly to the relevant departments and asked phone receptionists if the clinic accepted Medicaid. We were able to contact every hospital using the main telephone number. Our first research question was answered using solely the surgeon survey responses. Our second and third research questions were addressed using a combination of the responses to the surgeon surveys and specific hospital telephone calls.

Results

Preoperative hemoglobin A1c cutoffs were used at 77% (27 of 35) of responding institutions and preoperative BMI cutoffs were used at 54% (19 of 35) of responding institutions. In the secret shopper portion of our study, we found that almost all the institutions (98% [49 of 50]) had a medical weight loss clinic, surgical weight loss clinic, or combined program. Regarding smoking cessation, 52% (26 of 50) referred patients to a specific department in their institution and 18% (9 of 50) referred to a state-run smoking cessation hotline. Thirty percent (15 of 50) did not offer any internal resource or external referral for smoking cessation. Regarding dental care, 48% (24 of 50) of institutions had a dental clinic that performed presurgical check-ups and 46% (23 of 50) did not offer any internal resource or external referral for dental care. In the secret shopper portion of our study, for institutions that had internal resources, we found that 86% (42 of 49) of weight loss clinics, 88% (23 of 26) of smoking cessation programs, and 58% (14 of 24) of dental clinics accepted Medicaid insurance.

Conclusion

Proceeding with TJA may not be the best option for all patients; however, surgeons and patients should come to this consensus together after a thoughtful discussion of the risks and benefits for that particular patient. Future research should focus on how shared decision-making may influence patient satisfaction and a patient's ability to meet preoperative goals related to weight loss, glycemic control, smoking cessation, and dental care. Decision analyses or time trade-off analyses could be implemented in these studies to assess patients' tolerance for risk.

Clinical Relevance

Orthopaedic surgeons should engage in shared decision-making with patients to develop realistic goals for weight loss, glycemic control, smoking cessation, and dental care that consider patient access to these services as well as the difficulties patients experience in losing weight, controlling blood glucose, and stopping smoking.

### Clinical practice guideline for red blood cell transfusion thresholds in very preterm neonates [^112vSP7r]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common medical intervention to treat anemia in very preterm neonates; however, best transfusion practices, such as thresholds, remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop recommendations for clinicians on the use of RBC transfusions in very preterm neonates.

Evidence Review

An international steering committee reviewed evidence from a systematic review of 6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared high vs low hemoglobin-based or hematocrit-based transfusion thresholds. The steering committee reached consensus on certainty-of-evidence ratings and worked with a panel from stakeholder organizations on reviewing the evidence. With input from parent representatives and the stakeholder panel, the steering committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations.

Findings

A systematic review of 6 RCTs encompassing 3483 participants (1759 females [51.3%]; mean [SD] age range, 25.9–29.8 [1.5–3.0] weeks) was used as the basis of the recommendations. The ranges for higher hemoglobin concentration (liberal) vs lower hemoglobin concentration (restrictive) threshold study arms were similar across the trials. However, specific thresholds differed based on the severity of illness, which was defined using variable criteria in the trials. There was moderate certainty of evidence that low transfusion thresholds likely had little to no difference in important short-term and long-term outcomes. The recommended hemoglobin thresholds varied on the basis of postnatal week and respiratory support needs. At postnatal weeks 1, 2, and 3 or more, for neonates on respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 11, 10, and 9 g/dL, respectively; for neonates on no or minimal respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 10, 8.5, and 7 g/dL, respectively (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0).

Conclusions and Relevance

This consensus statement recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy, with moderate certainty of evidence, for preterm neonates with less than 30 weeks' gestation.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals… [^1153UFYL]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Hb values were further adjusted for smoking among women. World Health Organization Hb cut points for anemia are 11. 00 g/dL for children and
12. 00 g/dL for nonpregnant women. To convert Hb to grams per liter, multiply by 10. Q / df indicates test of Cochrane Q statistic for heterogeneity at the given df. Question Are the current World Health Organization hemoglobin cutoffs to define anemia comparable to statistical and physiological Hb cutoffs calculated using representative surveys from multiple countries collected in the last 20 years. Findings. Conclusions and Relevance Current WHO cutoffs to define anemia are higher than the pooled fifth percentile of Hb among persons who are outwardly healthy and from nearly all survey-specific estimates. The lower proposed Hb cutoffs are statistically significant but also reflect compensatory increased erythropoiesis.

More studies based on clinical outcomes could further confirm the validity of these Hb cutoffs for anemia. Anemia, or low hemoglobin concentration insufficient to meet an individual's physiological needs, is the most common blood condition and affects approximately one-third of the world's population. 1, 2 The World Health Organization Hb cutoffs to define anemia1 were first established in 1968 by experts who. stated that, "over 95% of normal individuals are believed to show Hb levels higher than the cutoffs given". 3 Although these cutoffs were derived from a few studies involving European4, 5 and North American6, 7 men, children, and pregnant women, they have been applied uniformly among all geographical regions, 3 with adjustments for those residing at higher altitudes or who smoke cigarettes.
8.

Density plots demonstrated that the entire Hb distribution of the healthy subpopulation was right-shifted compared with the overall population, irrespective of adjusting Hb for smoking or altitude, suggesting that apparently healthy and iron-replete individuals were identified. The healthy subgroup had lower prevalence of anemia on the basis of WHO cutoffs1:

23. 4% compared with
40. 9% for children, and 13. 0% compared with
22. 3% for women.

### Don't administer packed red blood cells in a young healthy… [^112fTavQ]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

The hemoglobin transfusion threshold used in multiple studies has varied from 6. 0 to
10. 0 g/dL. The optimal hemoglobin/hematocrit criterion for transfusion remains controversial in several clinical settings. Nevertheless, compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a lower hemoglobin threshold is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay. Hospital mortality remains lower in patients randomized to a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion versus those randomized to a higher hemoglobin threshold. The decision to transfuse should be based on a combination of both clinical and hemodynamic parameters.

### Red blood cell transfusion-AABB guidelines… [^116WX4Uc]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL. For pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds. For most patient populations, results provided moderate quality evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes. Recommendation 1: for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. In accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most trials, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.

5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for those undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Recommendation 2: for hospitalized adult patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders, the panel suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL. Recommendation 3: for critically ill children and those at risk of critical illness who are hemodynamically stable and without a hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac condition, or severe hypoxemia, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL.

Recommendation 4: for hemodynamically stable children with congenital heart disease, the international panel suggests a transfusion threshold that is based on the cardiac abnormality and stage of surgical repair: 7 g/dL, 9 g/dL, or 7 to 9 g/dL. Conclusions and Relevance It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

### Don't routinely transfuse stable, asymptomatic hospitalized patients with a hemoglobin level greater than 7–8 grams… [^116vGbMH]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple factors need to be considered in transfusion decisions, including the patient's clinical status and oxygen delivery ability. Arbitrary hemoglobin or hematocrit thresholds should not be used as the only criterion for transfusions of packed red blood cells.
