## Question

Will the Bp drop suddenly if we do dialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether blood pressure can drop suddenly during hemodialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is defined and how often it occurs. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the roles of ultrafiltration, plasma refilling, and vasoregulatory responses. Next, I will examine contributing factors like dialysate temperature, sodium and potassium profiles, and patient susceptibility. After that, I should review the clinical consequences and risk stratification. Finally, I will consider prevention and management strategies and synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and frequency so I don't overstate the risk. Intradialytic hypotension is commonly defined as a sudden drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a nadir systolic BP below 90 mmHg, often accompanied by symptoms requiring intervention, and it complicates roughly 15–30% of dialysis sessions depending on the definition and cohort, with some studies reporting up to 17% of sessions and affecting the majority of patients at least once over time [^115UHWKY] [^116GD8TS] [^113st91L].

> Wait, let me verify the core mechanism before moving on. The primary driver is rapid ultrafiltration that outpaces plasma refilling from the interstitium, reducing intravascular volume and cardiac preload; when compensatory vasoconstriction and autonomic responses are inadequate, cardiac output and blood pressure fall, and in some patients there is paradoxical sympathetic withdrawal and venous pooling that further worsens the drop, sometimes via adenosine-mediated pathways and the Bezold-Jarisch reflex [^11692aYi] [^1133xtva] [^116wdmhw].

> Hold on, I should review splanchnic mechanisms because they can precipitate abrupt hypotension even when the ultrafiltration rate seems modest. Early dialysis can cause a centripetal redistribution of blood from the splanchnic bed to the central circulation, followed by ischemia-induced splanchnic vasodilation that suddenly increases venous capacity and shifts blood away from the heart, producing a precipitous fall in preload and blood pressure despite ongoing refilling, which helps explain why IDH can appear suddenly mid-session [^115S4FPF].

> I need to check how dialysate temperature influences this. Warm dialysate promotes peripheral vasodilation and worsens IDH, whereas cool dialysate at or below core temperature enhances vasoconstriction, preserves central blood volume, and reduces IDH frequency; randomized and observational data support cooling strategies, though long-term outcome benefits remain uncertain and individual tolerance varies [^116p3RMw] [^116ngFeG].

> Let me consider sodium-related dynamics next. High dialysate sodium can transiently maintain plasma volume and reduce IDH but may promote sodium loading, interdialytic weight gain, and hypertension; conversely, lower dialysate sodium can reduce interdialytic BP burden but may increase IDH risk if not individualized, so sodium profiling must be used judiciously and tailored to the patient's volume status and symptoms [^113LKQ1z] [^116ngFeG].

> I should double-check potassium effects because they can be counterintuitive. Rapid reductions in serum potassium during dialysis can acutely decrease peripheral vascular resistance and precipitate hypotension, and lower dialysate potassium has been associated with more intradialytic hypotension episodes, whereas higher potassium baths may mitigate early-session pressure drops, underscoring the need to balance arrhythmia risk against hemodynamic stability [^114325nT].

> Next, I should review patient-specific susceptibility so I don't miss high-risk phenotypes. Older age, diabetes, autonomic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, low predialysis BP, and high interdialytic weight gains all increase IDH risk, and impaired baroreflex function is common in ESRD, limiting compensatory responses to volume shifts and contributing to sudden drops during treatment [^116GD8TS] [^1114sPGp] [^116wdmhw].

> But wait, what about the clinical consequences and how we define "significant" hypotension. IDH is associated with immediate symptoms such as dizziness, cramps, and nausea, impairs dialysis adequacy, and is linked to vascular access thrombosis, hospitalization, and mortality; large observational data also associate peridialytic BP falls of 30 mmHg or more with higher mortality and cardiac arrest risk, highlighting the prognostic weight of even transient hemodynamic instability [^115UHWKY] [^116o3y9p] [^114yeeD7].

> I will now examine prevention and mitigation strategies to ensure the answer is actionable. Reducing ultrafiltration rate by extending session time, treating more frequently, or targeting lower interdialytic weight gains is foundational; cool dialysate, sodium profiling used selectively, and UF profiling with higher early removal and slower late rates can improve hemodynamic stability; biofeedback systems that adjust UF or dialysate conductivity in response to BP or blood volume signals reduce IDH in some studies, though evidence quality varies and individualized thresholds remain challenging [^116jRbyD] [^116ngFeG] [^111HCBJx] [^117BwQBm].

> Hold on, I should verify acute management details so I don't omit basics. When IDH occurs, standard nursing actions include stopping or reducing ultrafiltration, placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position, and administering saline boluses; midodrine can raise nadir BP in some patients but evidence for consistent symptom reduction and hard outcomes is limited and mixed, so it should be reserved for selected cases after addressing volume, temperature, and UF rate [^115jQ7Po] [^112HQeG7].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Yes, blood pressure can drop suddenly during hemodialysis, and this is a predictable complication driven primarily by rapid ultrafiltration exceeding plasma refilling, compounded by vasoregulatory failure, splanchnic blood shifts, and treatment factors such as warm dialysate and rapid electrolyte changes; with modern definitions, IDH occurs in roughly 15–30% of sessions, can be abrupt and symptomatic, and carries meaningful short- and long-term risks, but it is also modifiable through individualized prescription adjustments, volume control, temperature strategies, and vigilant monitoring [^115UHWKY] [^116GD8TS] [^11692aYi] [^116ngFeG].

Dialysis can cause a **sudden BP drop** due to rapid ultrafiltration, plasma refilling failure, autonomic dysfunction, and dialysate-related factors [^11692aYi]. This is called intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and is common, occurring in **15–50% of sessions** depending on definition and patient factors [^115UHWKY] [^116GD8TS]. IDH is associated with symptoms, organ ischemia, and higher mortality, so prevention focuses on **individualized UF rates**, longer or more frequent dialysis, sodium/temperature profiling, and careful medication timing [^116ngFeG] [^116jRbyD] [^114NNzWY].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of sudden BP drop during dialysis

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie sudden BP drops during dialysis:

- **Ultrafiltration and plasma refilling**: Rapid fluid removal can outpace plasma refilling from the interstitium, reducing intravascular volume and cardiac output, causing hypotension [^11692aYi] [^1133xtva].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Impaired baroreflex and sympathetic responses in ESRD blunt compensatory vasoconstriction, increasing IDH risk [^1114sPGp] [^116wdmhw].

- **Dialysate-related factors**: Warm dialysate causes vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance; low sodium or bicarbonate and rapid potassium shifts can also destabilize hemodynamics [^116QuPJ6] [^114HiSuR] [^114325nT].

- **Cardiac factors**: Diastolic dysfunction and limited cardiac reserve reduce tolerance to volume shifts, precipitating hypotension [^11692aYi].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance of intradialytic hypotension

IDH is **common and clinically meaningful**:

- **Incidence**: Occurs in 15–50% of sessions, varying by definition and population [^115UHWKY].

- **Symptoms**: Dizziness, nausea, cramps, and syncope are frequent and impair quality of life [^116GD8TS] [^115U13L2].

- **Organ ischemia**: IDH can cause cardiac, cerebral, and mesenteric ischemia, contributing to morbidity and mortality [^113S6jWM] [^112bdVDm].

- **Mortality**: IDH is linked to higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially with large BP drops [^114yeeD7] [^116o3y9p].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing susceptibility to sudden BP drop

Certain patients are **more prone to IDH**:

| **Factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Age (> 65 years) | Reduced autonomic function and cardiac reserve [^116GD8TS] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Autonomic neuropathy and vascular stiffness [^112Nfvbc] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Impaired cardiac function and limited compensatory responses [^11692aYi] |
| High interdialytic weight gain | Requires higher UF rates, increasing IDH risk [^113xJZZb] |
| Autonomic dysfunction | Blunted baroreflex and sympathetic responses [^1114sPGp] |
| Medications (e.g. antihypertensives) | Exacerbate hypotension during UF [^112HQeG7] |

---

## Preventive strategies and management of sudden BP drop during dialysis

Effective **prevention and management** include:

- **Individualized UF rates**: Tailor UF to plasma refilling capacity to avoid excessive volume removal [^1133xtva] [^113xJZZb].

- **Extended dialysis duration**: Longer or more frequent sessions reduce UF rates and IDH risk [^116jRbyD] [^113Lomn6].

- **Dialysate temperature and sodium profiling**: Cooler dialysate and sodium modeling improve hemodynamic stability, though sodium profiling must be used cautiously [^116ngFeG] [^116p3RMw].

- **Medication management**: Adjust antihypertensives and consider midodrine for refractory IDH [^112HQeG7] [^114NNzWY].

- **Monitoring and biofeedback**: Continuous BP and blood volume monitoring enable real-time UF adjustments [^113Lomn6] [^117BwQBm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized care** and evidence-based strategies:

- **KDIGO**: Recommends individualized BP/volume management, extended dialysis, and cautious use of sodium/temperature profiling [^116ngFeG] [^1127c38q].

- **KDOQI**: Advocates UF rate optimization, sodium restriction, and regular dry weight reassessment [^116jRbyD] [^116rKnEB].

- **UK Kidney Association**: Supports individualized BP targets, UF rate management, and medication review [^117DDDYK] [^114NNzWY].

---

Dialysis can cause a **sudden BP drop** via ultrafiltration, autonomic dysfunction, and dialysate effects, with IDH common and consequential. Prevention hinges on individualized UF, extended dialysis, and careful use of dialysate/medication strategies to reduce IDH and its complications [^115UHWKY] [^116ngFeG].

### Effect of cool vs. warm dialysate on toxin removal: rationale and study design [^117FQ1rC]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment modification

Study sessions will be discontinued, should adverse-effects such as acute hypotensive episode (defined by sudden change in blood pressure – drop of 20 mm Hg or SBP < 100) or chest pain, uneasiness, or cramps manifest. Although these are anticipated to be at low event occurrence rate, the event will be medically recorded and dealt with usual clinical practice. During the session, if a patient complains about temperature being too high or too low, then the dialysate temperature will be adjusted to his/her routine prescription and subject will be removed from the study. A report of all such adverse events will be provided to the ethics board.

Outcome measure

Primary outcome measure

The objective of this clinical study is to investigate the effect of dialysate temperature on removal of both small and large-sized toxins. To quantify the removed toxin mass in an individual study session, the spent dialysate sample will be analyzed for toxin concentration. The removed toxin mass will potentially depend on the pre-dialysis toxin concentration. If pre-dialysis toxin concentration is high then there is a possibility that more toxin mass will be removed; hence removed toxin mass assessed by spent dialysate will be scaled with respect to pre-dialysis serum toxin concentration. This scaled removed toxin mass for both study sessions will be compared using standard statistical t -test. The toxin reduction ratio will also be calculated using pre- and post-dialysis toxin concentrations.

Secondary outcome measure

Dialysate temperature can potentially change the hemodynamic response. For each study session, patient blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be recorded at every 5 minutes during the whole study session. If any sudden change in BP or HR is noticed, the dialysis nurses will be informed and appropriate clinical action will be taken. If hemodynamic response is indicative of hypotensive episode, then study session will be suspended. The schematic flow chart of the study is presented in Figure 1.

### Wearable health devices and personal area networks: can they improve outcomes in haemodialysis patients? [^114Cmqcx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

MONITORING DURING DIALYSIS AND BEYOND: TOWARDS A CLINICAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

Patients on haemodialysis spend considerable time in different and often separated ecosystems, i.e. the dialysis clinic, hospital and their home environment. With haemodialysis, they undergo an intensive treatment that has profound pathophysiologic effects. There is substantial evidence suggesting that impaired organ perfusion during dialysis can result in irreversible organ damage. Blood pressure (BP), which is at best an indirect marker of organ perfusion, is measured discontinuously during dialysis, whereas symptomatic drops in BP may suddenly occur when ventricular filling is critically reduced. Recently, several studies addressed the relevance of changes in central venous oxygen saturation (scvO 2), which can be measured continuously by an optical probe connected to the blood line in patients with a central venous catheter, as a surrogate marker of upper body perfusion and haemodynamic status. Changes in scvO 2 were related to ultrafiltration (UF) rate but also independently to outcome. These are just examples of variables that could be monitored continuously with wearable and unobtrusive technologies (near-infrared spectroscopy, PPG or other optical methods). Non-invasive monitoring and interpretation of multiple physiological signals in combination with dialysis treatment parameters and patient characteristics can be aided by mathematical models and/or AI, which might result in a more precise prediction of pending organ ischaemia or sudden intradialytic hypotension and trigger alerts before a clinical event ensues. A preliminary example of such an approach was presented by Barbieri et al. in which an artificial neural network predicted nadir systolic BP and heart rate with reasonable accuracy. In the future, such models could be combined with UF feedback control systems that automatically adjust UF rate or treatment time when the algorithm would predict impending drops in tissue perfusion or BP. These developments, which might also be of great relevance for home haemodialysis patients, may contribute to a clinical intelligence system surrounding dialysis treatments in the future (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Example of a 'clinical intelligence system'.

These developments logically would first build upon already existing telehealth systems for home dialysis patients and evolve from there. Smart automated recognition of meaningful events, and automated data reliability indicators will increasingly become key to avoid 'drowning' clinicians in a flood of raw traces and false alarms.

### Pathophysiology of dialysis hypotension: an update [^11692aYi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Dialysis hypotension occurs because a large volume of blood water and solutes are removed over a short period of time, overwhelming normal compensatory mechanisms, including plasma refilling and reduction of venous capacity, due to reduction of pressure transmission to veins. In some patients, seemingly paradoxical and inappropriate reduction of sympathetic tone may occur, causing reduction of arteriolar resistance, increased transmission of pressure to veins, and corresponding increase in venous capacity. Increased sequestration of blood in veins under conditions of hypovolemia reduces cardiac filling, cardiac output, and, ultimately, blood pressure. Adenosine release due to tissue ischemia may participate in reducing norepinephrine release locally, and activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, perhaps in patients with certain but as yet undefined cardiac pathology, may be responsible for sudden dialysis hypotension. Patients with diastolic dysfunction may be more sensitive to the effects of reduced cardiac filling. The ultimate solution is reducing the ultrafiltration rate by use of longer dialysis sessions, more frequent dialysis, or reduction in salt intake. Increasing dialysis solution sodium chloride levels helps maintain blood volume and refilling but ultimately increases thirst and interdialytic weight gain, with a possible adverse effect on hypertension. Blood volume monitoring with ultrafiltration or dialysis solution sodium feedback loops are promising new strategies. Maintaining tissue oxygenation via an adequate blood hemoglobin level seems to be important. Use of adenosine antagonists remains experimental. Given the importance of sympathetic withdrawal, the use of pharmacologic sympathetic agonists is theoretically an attractive therapeutic strategy.

### To cool, or too cool: is reducing dialysate temperature the optimal approach to preventing intradialytic hypotension? [^116p3RMw]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Abnormal decreases in blood pressure during hemodialysis are frequent in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with hemodialysis, and thought to be largely due to an inadequate cardiovascular response to the rapid blood volume decline. Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and cardiac instability during dialysis can increase risks for negative health consequences and is possibly preventable though several types of interventions. One intervention that holds promise for prevention of IDH in hemodialysis patients is to reduce the temperature of the dialysate to or below the patient's core temperature. A considerable number of randomized studies have demonstrated a short term benefit of using a cooler dialysate temperature for the prevention of IDH and improved cardiac stability. Despite this, a key observational study was not able to show long term improvements with lower dialysate temperatures utilized in routine clinical practice, albeit possibly confounded by indication. It appears that cooling the dialysate may be reasonable to consider on an individual basis for patients who suffer from persistent IDH if they can tolerate the adjustment and it is effective. However, careful assessment of the etiology of IDH should be performed when considering treatment options. In this review, we detail the current body of evidence on the effectiveness of using low dialysate temperatures for prevention of IDH in ESRD patients, and suggest areas where further research is needed.

### Blood pressure in hemodialysis: targets? [^114eE8y1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the absence of 'hard' clinical-trial evidence to define optimal blood pressure (BP) targets and validate different BP measurement techniques, management of hypertension in hemodialysis is based on expert opinions. In this review, we provide a comparative evaluation of out-of-dialysis BP monitoring versus dialysis-unit BP recordings in diagnosing hypertension, guiding its management and prognosticating mortality risk.

Recent Findings

Owing to their high variability and poor reproducibility, predialysis and postdialysis BP recordings provide inaccurate reflection of the actual BP load outside of dialysis. Contrary to the reverse association of peridialytic BP with mortality, elevated home and ambulatory BP provides a direct mortality signal. Out-of-dialysis BP monitoring, even when done in the clinic, is a reliable approach to manage hypertension in the dialysis unit. Whenever none of these measures are available, median intradialytic SBP can provide a better estimate of interdialytic BP levels compared with peridialytic BP measurements.

Summary

Although out-of-dialysis BP monitoring have better diagnostic accuracy and prognostic validity, randomized trials are needed to ascertain BP targets for managing hypertension in hemodialysis patients.

### Management of blood pressure in adults, children and young people on dialysis: UK kidney association clinical practice guideline [^117DDDYK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

People with end stage kidney disease receiving dialysis have a very risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, affecting around 90% of dialysis patients. Conversely, intradialytic hypotension in haemodialysis patients is associated with debilitating symptoms as well as the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Blood pressure management in dialysis patients involves accurate measurement of blood pressure, setting a target blood pressure, adequate fluid volume management, lifestyle changes, modification of dialysis and dialysate, and the use of medication with proven efficacy in these patients. However, globally there is no published contemporary clinical practice guideline to assist health care professionals to manage blood pressure in dialysis patients. This is mainly because of a dearth of good quality evidence to inform guideline recommendations. Here, we present a comprehensive guideline to manage blood pressure in dialysis patients based on a thorough systematic review of literature. The guideline development committee comprised a multidisciplinary group of nephrology healthcare professionals and a patient. The evidence underpinning the guidance is often of moderate to low quality, influencing the strength of the recommendations. Therefore, the committee have come up with a list of research recommendations with a view to informing future guidelines. It is envisaged that this guideline will improve the care and outcomes of dialysis patients in the UK and elsewhere.

### Haemodynamic consequences of changing potassium concentrations in haemodialysis fluids [^11684Pv9]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Kidneys are responsible for long-term potassium homeostasis; this exposes patients with end-stage renal disease to a high risk of hyperkalaemia. Recovering potassium homeostasis is one of the important objective of dialysis. Considering that its location is mainly intracellular (98% of the pool), its potential removability during a haemodialysis session is quantitatively modest (between 40 and 80 mmol corresponding to 1–2% of total body potassium). As a consequence, even if, in order to be suitable, potassium removal during dialysis should be equal to the amount accumulated during the inter-dialytic phase, in clinical practice the potassium concentration in the dialysate is usually adjusted with the suboptimal goal of avoiding pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia.

The importance of the body content and serum concentration of potassium to control blood pressure remains controversial. Epidemiological data suggest a role for potassium depletion as a co-factor in the development and severity of hypertension, while dietary potassium inversely correlates with blood pressure. In animal models, an acute decrease in serum potassium concentration produces vasocostriction mediated by the vascular endothelium and an increase in myocardial contractility; the opposite effect is observed if it increases.

In haemodialysis nephrologists are faced with sudden changes in blood pressure and haemodynamic fragility phases that have a multi-factorial origin; ultrafiltration, decrease in osmolarity with imbalance and correction of metabolic acidosis play a predominant role. Despite this, and thanks to some strategies based on current practice, with particular reference to calcium and magnesium concentration in the dialysate, dialysate temperature and ultrafiltration and sodium concentration profiles, pressure stability is guaranteed as a general rule. Some electrolytes, particularly sodium and bicarbonate, can be modulated in profiles with the purpose of better respecting the gap in osmolarity or concentration that is established during the haemodialysis session, but their haemodynamic effect still remains controversial.

Serum potassium is an electrolyte whose concentration - in order to guarantee a negative balance - varies rapidly and significantly during dialysis, frequently resulting in going from pre-dialysis hyperpotassaemia to intra-dialysis hypopotassaemia. In a study performed by Dolson, designed to analyze the consequences of acute potassium changes on haemodynamics, differences in intra-dialytic blood pressure were not found between the groups treated with dialysates containing 1, 2 or 3 mmol/l of potassium. However, at the end of the dialysis session those patients treated with the lower potassium concentrations showed what was called a "rebound hypertension".

### Sudden cardiac death in chronic kidney disease: epidemiology and prevention [^116o3y9p]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Annual cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher than in the general population. The rate of sudden cardiac death increases as the stage of CKD increases and could be responsible for 60% of cardiac deaths in patients undergoing dialysis. In hemodialysis units treating patients with CKD, cardiac arrest occurs at a rate of seven arrests per 100,000 hemodialysis sessions. Important risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with CKD include hospitalization within the past 30 days, a drop of 30 mmHg in systolic blood pressure during hemodialysis, duration of life on hemodialysis, time since the previous dialysis session, and the presence of concomitant diabetes mellitus. As a result of the adverse cardiomyopathic and vasculopathic milieu in CKD, the occurrence of arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and sudden cardiac death could be exacerbated by electrolyte shifts, divalent ion abnormalities, diabetes, sympathetic overactivity, in addition to inflammation and perhaps iron deposition. Impaired baroreflex effectiveness and sensitivity, as well as obstructive sleep apnea, might also contribute to the risk of sudden death in CKD. The likelihood of survival following cardiac arrest is very low in dialysis patients. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiac arrest could reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD. Cardioverter-defibrillator implantation decreases the risk of sudden death in patients with CKD. The decision to implant a cardioverter-defibrillator should be influenced by the patient's age and stage of CKD.

### Hypotension and hypovolemia during hemodialysis: is the usual suspect innocent? [^117VAEnH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Hypotension during intermittent hemodialysis is common, and has been attributed to acute volume shifts, shifts in osmolarity, electrolyte imbalance, temperature changes, altered vasoregulation, and sheer hypovolemia. Although hypovolemia may intuitively seem a likely cause for hypotension in intensive care patients, its role in the pathogenesis of intradialytic hypotension may be overestimated.

### Hemodialysis-induced hypotension: impact of technologic advances [^1133xtva]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis-induced hypotension is one of the most serious complications in renal replacement therapy. The main cause of intradialytic hypotension is hypovolemia due to an imbalance between the amount of fluid removed and the refilling capacity of the intravascular compartment. Hypotension occurs when compensatory mechanisms for hypovolemia are overwhelmed by excessive fluid removal. As long as renal replacement therapy is limited to only a few hours per week, intradialytic hypotension will continue to be a relevant problem. Research has mainly focused on enlarging the compensatory capacity for ultrafiltration-induced hypovolemia. This article critically discusses the technical approaches that have been introduced into therapy in recent years with the promise of reducing dialysis-induced hypotensive episodes.

### Blood pressure control in dialysis patients [^117TJXTj]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is present in most patients on hemodialysis, and evidence suggests that it is not well controlled. In this review we discuss the pathogenesis of hypertension in these patients and the reasons that short-duration, intermittent hemodialysis makes blood pressure treatment especially difficult. We provide suggestions for targeting volume management as a basis for optimal hypertension treatment.

### Recent advances in the prevention and management of intradialytic hypotension [^114spxrM]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension continues to play a significant role in the morbidity and in some cases the mortality associated with maintenance hemodialysis. Greater precision in the determination of dry weight using bioimpedance technology and biofeedback systems designed to prevent rapid fluctuations in blood volume have recently been shown to decrease the frequency of this complication. Pharmacologic strategies designed to maintain peripheral vascular resistance in patients with insufficient release of endogenous vasoconstrictors continue to be explored. The sudden development of intradialytic hypotension may respond to specific antagonists to hypotensive mediators.

### Blood pressure management in hemodialysis: what have we learned? [^116pTeTZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent developments in the field of hypertension in hemodialysis patients.

Recent Findings

Despite the fact that hypertension is the most common complication of end-stage kidney disease, no evidence-based blood pressure (BP) targets exist for hemodialysis patients. There is growing evidence that outcomes are better predicted by out-of-office BP values, such as home or ambulatory BP monitoring. Intradialytic hypertension is associated with increased risk of death or hospitalization, and is probably mediated by volume overload. BP management should focus on volume control: dry weight 'probing' is well tolerated and effective in lowering BP, as are other strategies that minimize expansion of the extracellular fluid volume, such as avoidance of hypernatric dialysate. We discuss each of these issues in our review.

Summary

Modest advances in the understanding of hypertension have occurred in the past 2 years. Clinical trials that focus on BP targets and treatment choices are essential to guide future practice.

### Blood pressure management in hemodialysis patients: what we know and what questions remain [^114CeUy8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Despite having thousands of blood pressure (BP) readings on individual dialysis patients over the course of a year, our knowledge about the optimal assessment of BP, the mechanisms underlying hypertension and its management remain incomplete. Observational studies reveal that BP is lower at home than when measured in the dialysis unit. However, we do not know if using home vs. in-center measurements to guide treatment decisions improves BP control and/or clinical outcomes. Moreover, a recent US study suggests that typical hemodialysis patients are unlikely to adhere to home monitoring over the long term. Volume excess is one of probably many factors mediating hypertension in this population. A randomized clinical trial of aggressively challenging dry weight in patients without overt signs of fluid overload was shown to reduce BP, but there was an increase in vascular access thrombosis and intradialytic hypotension episodes. Long-term studies have not been done; thus, we do not know whether "squeezing dry weight" as a means to control BP is of more benefit than harm. Daily or prolonged nocturnal dialysis consistently has been shown to lower BP. To what extent this is a result of enhanced solute clearance vs. removal of excess volume is not clear. Use of bioimpedance or relative blood volume monitoring to guide fluid management has been tested in small studies, but more data are needed to determine whether their use impacts clinical outcomes. Well-designed clinical trials to determine whether a specific antihypertensive drug class is of benefit, independent of BP lowering, are lacking. The BP target that optimizes outcomes HD patients is also unknown. Observational studies consistently show poorer survival with predialysis BP < 140/90 mmHg, although such studies likely are confounded by low BP due to cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. In this review, we discuss what is known and the questions that remain regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, etiology, and management of hypertension in hemodialysis patients.

CONCLUSION

Managing BP and volume in dialysis requires an individualized approach with integration of numerous clinical, dialysis treatment, and patient factors.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^116GD8TS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Often competing, though sometimes associated with fluid control, is intra-dialytic hypotension, which also has immediate consequences familiar in the dialysis unit, including dizziness and cramps, as well as more long-term adverse effects. For example, Sands studied the occurrence of intra-dialytic hypotension (defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 30mmHg, to below 90mmHg) in 1137 patients in 13 dialysis facilities, over an average period of 3 months. With this definition, hypotension complicated 17.2% of sessions, affecting 74.9% of patients at least once, and 16.2% of patients on at least one third of their sessions. Those most prone to intra-dialytic hypotension were older, more comorbid and with lower pre-dialysis blood pressure, with associated sessional factors including high ultrafiltration volume and non-achievement of target weight. Outcomes associated with intra-dialytic hypotension included shortened survival and increased hospital admission.

### Blood pressure instability during hemodialysis [^116wdmhw]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on hemodialysis have chronic hypertension. However, hypotension is a frequent complication of hemodialysis, probably because of impaired baroreflex function. Less frequently, increases in pressure can be a complication of hemodialysis. Detailed studies of patients with these abnormalities in arterial pressure during hemodialysis may yield insights into the regulation of arterial pressure during ESRD.

### Can advances in hemodialysis machine technology prevent intradialytic hypotension? [^113Lomn6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension remains a frequent problem in routine outpatient hemodialysis. Although hypotension can be reduced by more frequent dialysis sessions and longer session duration, these options are not available for many patients. Advances in hemodialysis machine technology have led to the development of relative blood volume monitoring. However, multicenter trials seeking to document a reduction in the frequency of intradialytic hypotension have been disappointing. Further technological advances using "fuzzy" logic systems have been introduced; they track the fall in relative blood volume and then adjust either or both the ultrafiltration rate and dialyzate sodium concentration to maintain a preprogrammed fall in relative blood volume that is likely to be hemodynamically uneventful. Although these systems have been reported to reduce the frequency of serious intradialytic hypotensive episodes, they have not been successful in preventing them probably due to underlying issues with the use of relative blood volume monitoring. More attention needs to be focused on reducing ultrafiltration rates by reducing interdialytic weight gains. Successfully improving patient motivation and education, emphasizing dietary sodium restriction, lowering dialyzate sodium concentrations will all go a long way toward this goal. Technology has much to offer but will not solve this persistent problem.

### Intradialytic hypotension and splanchnic shifting: integrating an overlooked mechanism with the detection of ischemia-related signals during hemodialysis [^115S4FPF]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

In the most simple analysis, a patient's hematocrit during hemodialysis will rise when the rate of ultrafiltration exceeds the rate at which the fluid is mobilized from extravascular spaces; the greater the rise in hematocrit, the lower blood volume is and the more likely intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is to occur. A secondary mechanism of IDH may be due to sudden shift of blood volume away from the heart under conditions of borderline cardiac filling. A substantial portion of blood volume resides in the splanchnic venous system. During the early part of dialysis, a centripetal shift of red cells from this anatomical region to the central circulation has been documented to occur. The magnitude of this shift is unpredictable, and it may depend on the level of splanchnic vasoconstriction predialysis. The amount of splanchnic shift may also be reduced in patients with autonomic dysfunction. Once this central shift in blood volume has occurred, it can be reversed during further ultrafiltration due to ischemia-induced release of vasodilatory molecules that cause dilation of upstream splanchnic arterioles; this causes increased transmission of arterial pressure to the splanchnic veins, acutely increasing their capacity. The increased splanchnic venous capacity may cause a sudden shift of blood away from the central circulation to fill these veins under conditions where cardiac filling has already been reduced. The result can be severe IDH due to insufficient cardiac filling and cardiac output. One fruitful preventive approach might be to continuously monitor the blood or dialysate for the sudden appearance of such ischemia-related molecules or other signals which may herald not only dialysis hypotension but tissue stunning, warning that the fluid removal rate should be immediately reduced.

### The effect of treatment time, dialysis frequency, and ultrafiltration rate on intradialytic hypotension [^113xJZZb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Dialysis treatment time, the frequency of dialysis treatments, and the rate of fluid ultrafiltration-each impacts the incidence of intradialytic hypotension. These factors influence blood pressure independently and together. The strongest evidence supports that rapid ultrafiltration increases the likelihood of intradialytic hypotension and that combined strategies leading to a reduction in ultrafiltration rate have the greatest impact on reducing intradialytic hypotension. A practical approach to avoiding the effects of ultrafiltration on systemic hemodynamics would be to set a maximum ultrafiltration rate needed to achieve the desired fluid removal and vary the duration of the treatment to achieve that target volume. Randomized, controlled clinical trials of such strategies are warranted.

### Blood pressure and mortality in long-term hemodialysis-time to move forward [^116RVrpM]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Contrary to the direct, graded, and causal relationship of hypertension with cardiovascular outcomes in the general population, among dialysis patients, blood pressure (BP) recorded either predialysis or postdialysis displays a U-shaped curve with mortality. This paradoxical phenomenon of lower BP or a decline in BP over time being associated with increased mortality and higher BP being associated with a lower mortality is described as "reverse" epidemiology of hypertension, raising substantial controversy on whether BP lowering causes harms or benefits among dialysis patients. Unlike the inverse relationship of peridialytic BP with mortality, elevated BP recorded outside of dialysis is directly associated with poor long-term outcomes. Apart from the timing and technique of BP measurement, the U-shaped association of BP with mortality is also modified when accounting for factors related to patient's clinical characteristics and level of illness, dialysis practices, and patterns as well as factors related to the methodology of survival analysis. Most importantly, deliberate BP lowering with antihypertensive drugs is associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this review, we explore the complex association of peridialytic, intradialytic, and interdialytic BP with outcomes among dialysis patients. We conclude with recommendations for a wider use of out-of-dialysis BP monitoring as a tool to better evaluate the cardiovascular risk and optimize the management of hypertension in this high-risk population. Rather than more cohort studies, we call for randomized trials to test the level of BP in dialysis patients that is optimal for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Blood pressure and blood volume: acute and chronic considerations in hemodialysis [^115WpvAF]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is highly prevalent yet poorly controlled in the majority of dialysis patients and represents a significant burden of disease, with rates of morbidity and mortality greater than those in the general population. In dialysis, blood volume plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, with expansion of extracellular volume increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Within the current paradigm of dialysis prescription the majority of patients remain chronically volume expanded. However, management of blood pressure and volume state is difficult for clinicians with a paucity of randomized evidence adding to the complexity of nonlinear morbidity and mortality associations. With dialysis itself as a significant cardiac stressor, control of volume state is critical to minimize intradialytic hemodynamic instability, aid in preservation of cardiac anatomy and prevent progression to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review explores the relationship of blood volume to blood pressure and potential targets for management in this at risk population.

### Intradialytic blood pressure abnormalities: the highs, the lows and all that lies between… [^113S6jWM]. American Journal of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Frequent blood pressure (BP) measurements are necessary to ensure patient safety during hemodialysis treatments. Intradialytic BPs are not optimal tools for hypertension diagnosis and cardiovascular risk stratification, but they do have critical clinical and prognostic significance. We present evidence associating intradialytic BP phenomena including fall, rise and variability with adverse clinical outcomes and review related pathophysiologic mechanisms and potential management strategies.

Summary

Observational studies demonstrate associations between intradialytic hypotension, hypertension and BP variability and mortality. Lack of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria has hampered data synthesis, and prospective studies investigating optimal management strategies for BP phenomena are lacking. Mechanistic data suggest that cardiac, gut, kidney and brain ischemia may lie on the causal pathway between intradialytic hypotension and mortality, and endothelial cell dysfunction, among other factors, may be an important mediator of intradialytic hypertension and adverse outcomes. These plausible pathophysiologic links present potential therapeutic targets for future inquiry. The phenomenon of intradialytic BP variability has not been adequately studied, and practical clinical measures and treatment strategies are lacking.

Key Messages

Intradialytic BP phenomena have important prognostic bearing. Clinical practice guidelines for both intradialytic hypotension and hypertension exist, but their underlying evidence is weak overall. Further research is needed to develop consensus diagnostic criteria for intradialytic hypotension, hypertension and BP variability and to elucidate optimal treatment and prevention strategies for each BP manifestation.

### Shorter delivered dialysis times associate with a higher and more difficult to treat blood pressure [^1173tjEt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Shorter delivered dialysis times are associated with increased all-cause mortality. Whether shorter delivered dialysis times also associate with an increase in blood pressure (BP) and reduce the ability of probing dry weight to lower BP is unclear.

Methods

Among patients participating in the Dry-Weight Reduction in Hypertensive Hemodialysis Patients (DRIP) trial, interdialytic ambulatory BP was recorded at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Median intradialytic BP was also calculated at each dialysis treatment and associated with the delivered daily dialysis time.

Results

The median time on dialysis at baseline was 3.6 h per treatment (range 2.5–4.5 h). At baseline, modeled median intradialytic systolic BPs were higher among those who received fewer hours of dialysis. Among subjects who did not have their dry weight probed (control group), the median intradialytic systolic BP continued to be elevated. Probing dry weight (ultrafiltration group) provoked a drop in median intradialytic systolic BP regardless of the delivered dialysis time. However, the reduction in BP was achieved after fewer sessions of dialysis when delivered dialysis was longer in duration. The pattern of change was confirmed using interdialytic ambulatory BP monitoring.

Conclusions

Fewer hours of delivered dialysis are associated with a higher systolic BP. Upon probing dry weight, compared with shorter dialysis treatment times, 4 h of delivered dialysis per session provokes reductions in systolic BP over fewer dialysis treatment sessions. Reduction of BP may lag dry-weight reduction when shorter dialysis is delivered.

### Blood pressure target for the dialysis patient [^111zZyfq]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

The appropriate blood pressure (BP) target for dialysis patients remains controversial. Although there have been remarkable advances in this area in the general population, extrapolation of these data to dialysis patients is not possible. Observational studies in dialysis patients suggest that low BP is associated with worse outcomes. However, this is likely a result of confounding, considering that among dialysis patients with fewer cardiovascular comorbidities and longer survival, a more linear relationship exists between BP and mortality. Use of home BP measurements and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) measurements are more useful from a prognostic standpoint than in-center predialysis BP measurements. Large clinical trial data are, however, lacking and firm recommendations on BP targets for dialysis patients are not possible.

Definitions of intradialytic hypotension and hypertension

In a typical dialysis treatment session, BP decreases from preto post-dialysis; the magnitude of this reduction most closely relates to the magnitude of UF. Intradialytic hypotension is a serious complication of HD, associated with vascular access thrombosis, inadequate dialysis dose, and mortality. Intradialytic hypotension prevalence ranges from 15% to 50% of HD treatments, depending on the definition (Table 2).

Any symptomatic decrease in BP or a nadir intradialytic SBP of < 90 mm Hg should prompt reassessment of BP management. This reassessment includes, but is not limited to, UF rate, dialysis treatment time, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), dry-weight estimation, and antihypertensive medication use, in concordance with discussions in the following sections. Avoidance of intradialytic hypotension should not come at the expense of maintaining euvolemia or ensuring adequate dialysis time. Data on intradialytic hypotension during home HD or intermittent PD techniques are scarce.

Intradialytic hypertension is the phenomenon of BP increase during or immediately after a dialysis session, and it involves activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin–angiotensin systems, endothelial stiffness, volume excess, and other mechanisms. Intradialytic hypertension has an estimated prevalence of 5%–15%, depending on the definition used (Table 2). Defining it as an SBP increase of > 10 mm Hg from pre- to post-dialysis accurately identifies persons with persistently elevated interdialytic BPand demonstrates an association with hospitalization and mortality. An SBP increase of > 10 mm Hg from pre- to post-dialysis into the hypertensive range in at least 4 of 6 consecutive dialysis treatments should prompt a more extensive evaluation of BP and volume management, including out-of-unit BP measurements and a critical assessment of dry weight. Currently, there are no data on intradialytic hypertension in home HD or PD.

BP variability

Fluctuations of BP over the very short-term (beat-by-beat), short-term (within 24 hours), mid-term (day-by-day), and long-term (visit-to-visit) are associated with target-organ damage, cardiovascular events, and mortality in patients on HD. – However, whether BP variability is a modifiable risk factor or a marker of underlying pathology (e.g. volume shifts, arterial stiffness) remains uncertain. There are no studies of interventions targeting BP variability, so no treatment recommendations can be made, and further research is needed (Table 1).

### Blood pressure and volume management in dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1127c38q]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) and volume control are critical components of dialysis care and have substantial impacts on patient symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular complications. Yet, developing consensus best practices for BP and volume control have been challenging, given the absence of objective measures of extracellular volume status and the lack of high-quality evidence for many therapeutic interventions. In February of 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference titled Blood Pressure and Volume Management in Dialysis to assess the current state of knowledge related to BP and volume management and identify opportunities to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes among individuals receiving maintenance dialysis. Four major topics were addressed: BP measurement, BP targets, and pharmacologic management of suboptimal BP; dialysis prescriptions as they relate to BP and volume; extracellular volume assessment and management with a focus on technology-based solutions; and volume-related patient symptoms and experiences. The overarching theme resulting from presentations and discussions was that managing BP and volume in dialysis involves weighing multiple clinical factors and risk considerations as well as patient lifestyle and preferences, all within a narrow therapeutic window for avoiding acute or chronic volume-related complications. Striking this challenging balance requires individualizing the dialysis prescription by incorporating comorbid health conditions, treatment hemodynamic patterns, clinical judgment, and patient preferences into decision-making, all within local resource constraints.

Adverse effects of dialysis — potential risks: early concerns included inflammatory response and depletion of blood constituents such as platelets and clotting factors, as well as removal of low-molecular-weight hormones, vitamins, and other vital molecules; membranes were developed to be "biocompatible"; more recently, concern has been raised about transient intra- and postdialysis reductions in blood pressure, serum potassium, and serum phosphorus with other electrolyte and protein changes that may amount to a "perfect storm" of stress with potential acute cardiac and long-term brain and cardiovascular effects; frequent and more prolonged dialysis, while improving solute and volume removal, could enhance blood-membrane interaction, increase burden on patients and caregivers, and even accelerate loss of native kidney function and vascular access damage.

### The effect of ascending-descending ultrafiltration and sodium profiles on blood pressure in hemodialysis patients: a randomized cross-over study [^113ARfjH]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Hypotension is among the major complications arising during HD, which has been further acknowledged as the leading cause of discomfort in the patients affected. The results of the present study accordingly established that the patients' BP in the group receiving the A/D-UF profiling did not drop during HD, but remained in the same range until the end. Nevertheless, the patients' BP in the routine HD group gradually dropped, and this condition aggravated up until the session completed.

One of the main concerns related to the use of the UF profiling for HD has been thus the interdialytic increase in BP, which seems to be a rise in BP before this procedure. In the present study, no significant difference was further observed in the mean SBP among the patients before HD in the A/D-UF profiling group. Thus, it was concluded that the application of the A/D-UF profile did not produce a sudden increase in the interdialytic BP, and this alleviated the concerns about the growth in BP following this treatment method, which had been until that time brought up in some studies.

Upon the review of previous research into the effect of the A/D-UF profile on patients' BP during HD, no similar study was found. Therefore, the results of other investigations in this domain were considered. As an example, Tang et al. (2016) assessed the effect of the linear sodium profiling on BP in 13 HD patients at a hospital in China, and presented that the mean SBP after HD was higher in the intervention group than the controls, which was consistent with the results of the present study. This type of profiling seemed to help maintain the filling of the intravascular volume status in patients during HD, and further adjusted weighing intervals in keeping with the filling volume of the vessels. In addition, it prevented many complications for the duration of HD induced by hypotension, as well as insufficient interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and failure to reach dry weight at the end of each session. Moreover, Ghafouri-Fard et al. (2010) reflected on the effect of the linear and step-wise sodium and UF profiles on hypotension and muscle cramps on 26 patients undergoing HD at a hospital in Isfahan, Iran, and showed that the use of both profiles as trouble-free and low-cost methods could stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status during HD by adjusting the sodium concentration and the UF extraction rate.

### Prevalence of intradialytic hypotension, clinical symptoms and nursing interventions – a three-months, prospective study of 3818 haemodialysis sessions [^116zfYub]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

It is evident that the prevalence of dialysis hypotension is influenced by the dialysis settings. Shorter treatment times, higher ultrafiltration rates and relatively high dialysate temperatures are all risk factors for dialysis hypotension. Notably, in the present study dialysis duration was 3.5, to 4.5 h, ultrafiltration rate was relatively low (8.5 ± 3.3 ml/kg/h) and dialysate temperature was set at 36.0 or 36.5 °C. These dialysis settings may have contributed to the low prevalence of dialysis hypotension in our study relative to other studies.

A fall in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or a fall in MAP ≥ 10 mmHg occurred in more than three quarters of dialysis sessions. At patient level, as much as 96.8% of patients had a decrease in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in MAP ≥ 10 mmHg in more than 20% of dialysis sessions. It follows that a decrease in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or a fall in MAP ≥ 10 mmHg is so common that it is not specific for symptomatic dialysis hypotension. Notably, in most (58.2%) dialysis sessions that fulfilled the hypotension component of the EBPG definition, there was no clinical event or intervention. This raises the question whether a decrease in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in MAP ≥ 10 mmHg discriminates between patients with and without symptomatic dialysis hypotension. Various factors may affect predialysis blood pressure like stress due to transportation to the dialysis unit and anxiety for puncture of the fistula. When predialysis blood pressure is used as the reference point, part of the early intradialytic fall in blood pressure may be explained by the relief of stress/anxiety, e.g. after successful puncture of the fistula, and not by dialysis-specific haemodynamic stress. Conversely, haemodialysis may exert haemodynamic stress, including cardiac stunning, even in the absence of a significant blood pressure drop. Indeed, in this study, 3.0% of dialysis sessions were complicated by a clinical event without fulfilling the hypotension component of the definition. In our view, the starting point for a definition of symptomatic dialysis hypotension should be the occurrence of a clinical event and/or a nursing intervention instead of a minimum fall in SBP.

### Patterns in blood pressure medication use in US incident dialysis patients over the first 6 months [^113PZ1uV]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study evaluates BP medication prescription patterns in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in the first 6 months after dialysis initiation. Observational studies attempting to compare medication effectiveness should account for the time-varying nature of BP medication prescriptions, particularly in the first 6 months and if follow-up extends beyond 6–12 months. Given that most patients are prescribed multiple medications, investigators should consider study designs that incorporate medication combinations. Finally, prescription patterns after dialysis initiation differ by modality, and study designs should account for these differences. Further research is necessary to determine the effects of BP medication patterns on intermediate outcomes such as BP variability, and key clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, sudden cardiac death, and quality of life.

### Autonomic dysfunction as a mechanism of intradialytic blood pressure instability [^1114sPGp]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the principal endogenous defense mechanism that maintains blood pressure in the setting of hypotension. Disruption of the ANS impairs this ability and can contribute to blood pressure instability, including hypotension and hypertension. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the ANS and the consequences of its dysfunction in patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with dialysis. We also discuss possible mechanisms of this autonomic dysfunction that may need future investigation.

### Feedback control in hemodialysis [^117BwQBm]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

3 "FUZZY LOGIC" BIOFEEDBACK BASED ON BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT

Biofeedback systems have also been described that use blood pressure readings as the input variable. In this scenario, a fall in blood pressure triggers the automated response from the dialysis machine (e.g. reducing UF rate). Mancini et al. conducted a study using automatic blood pressure stabilization system (ABPS) that adopted a "fuzzy logic" approach, which is a problem‐solving control system methodology based on ambiguous, imprecise, or noisy input, to reduce the ultrafiltration rate if blood pressure values fell below a specified value, and increase ultrafiltration up to a maximum specified rate when blood pressure is above the threshold. Across 1372 dialysis treatments in 55 patients, IDH was reduced by 25.3% during biofeedback sessions compared to control sessions using conventional hemodialysis. However, there are some caveats with this approach, most importantly the difficulties in setting the critical blood pressure for individuals, particularly when considering that significant IDH may occur without symptoms, and that the hemodynamic stress of dialysis can invoke subclinical organ ischemia in the absence of traditional definitions of IDH. Biofeedback systems that use blood pressure as the input also need frequent measurements — in the study of Mancini et al. cuff measurements were taken every 5 min, which may not be tolerated by all patients. In the future, advances may come from approaches to continuously measure beat‐to‐beat blood pressure during hemodialysis coupled to predictive algorithms for IDH so that the feedback loop can be more responsive, and there are examples of such systems currently in development.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116rKnEB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Control of volume and blood pressure in hemodialysis (HD) patients emphasizes sodium restriction, avoidance of high dialysate sodium practices, careful ultrafiltration each treatment, and sustained efforts to reach and keep true dry weight. The guideline notes that "Reembracing the time-honored and useful, yet inexpensive, tool of dietary salt restriction should serve to promote the health of HD patients", and that "use of a high dialysate sodium concentration and sodium profiling should be discouraged". During volume control, "the development of hypotension during dialysis or hypertension between dialysis treatments should not be construed as a failure of volume control to normalize blood pressure", and "The lag phenomenon noted previously should be taken into consideration when evaluating patients with persistent hypertension". It also highlights "application of appropriate ultrafiltration with every dialysis treatment", "the incessant vigilance to target and subsequently to maintain a true dry weight (which is subject to change because of loss or gain of nonfluid body tissue)", and "confirmation that a patient is compliant with a sodium-restricted diet", noting that "an intense, totally committed, and prolonged effort — with a high degree of motivation — is required from caregivers, as well as from the patients themselves".

### Hypotension and hypovolemia during hemodialysis: is the usual suspect innocent? [^115Rg8qU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We congratulate Bitker et al. on this study because it challenges common clinical practice. We fully support their conclusion that intradialytic hypotension "should not necessarily lead to reduction of fluid removal by hemodialysis but should prompt hemodynamic evaluation of cardiovascular status to reliably classify patients regarding their preload dependence status". Hypervolemia and impaired cardiac function were almost certainly highly prevalent. Because hemodialysis can severely impair tissue perfusion without overt clinical signs and fluid dynamics during ultrafiltration might be considerably different between ICU patients and chronic hemodialysis, individual hemodynamic assessment could be more comprehensive than PLR alone. The assessment should include the clinical context, the hemodynamic status pre dialysis, and an independent judgment if a preload maneuver shows the expected effects.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^111wFwoB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis blood pressure and volume status — Among maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients, hypertension is prevalent: in the HEMO Study less than 30% were normotensive (among 1,238 patients), and in another cohort of 2,535 adults, 86% were hypertensive with only 30% controlled, 58% inadequately treated, and 12% untreated. Each 10 mm Hg increase in mean arterial blood pressure is correlated independently with progressive concentric LVH, de novo ischemic heart disease, and de novo congestive cardiac failure, and cardiovascular disease is responsible for at least 50% of HD deaths in the United States. Attempts to accelerate ultrafiltration may precipitate hypovolemia and hypotension; normal saline is frequently administered and ultrafiltration is slowed or discontinued, which may leave the targeted fluid excess unremoved and expand extracellular volume, leading to more sodium and water accumulation between sessions with persistent hypertension. In HD patients with reduced vascular and cardiac compliance, blood pressure goals may need to be higher and vigorous contraction of plasma volume should be avoided during ultrafiltration when hypotension is prone to occur; however, some have recommended that attempts be made to decrease these high pressures as much as possible to achieve optimal survival. Some dialysis patients with low predialysis blood pressures have a high mortality rate, and in a small number of patients blood pressure paradoxically increases after dialysis.

### Pro: ambulatory blood pressure should be used in all patients on hemodialysis [^115BZCZ8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

In the adult population in general and among people with chronic kidney disease in particular, it is now well established that hypertension is a major driver of renal disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although the contribution of hypertension to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients on long-term dialysis continues to be debated, a major barrier to detect hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular events in these patients has been the inability to diagnose hypertension. Largely to blame has been the easy availability of pre-dialysis and post-dialysis blood pressure recordings in stark contrast to ambulatory blood pressure measurements in dialysis patients to accurately diagnose the presence or control of hypertension. It is increasingly becoming clear that out-of-office blood pressure recordings are superior to clinic recordings in making a diagnosis, assessing target organ damage, evaluating prognosis and managing patients with hypertension. In this debate, I have been asked to defend the position that ambulatory blood pressure recordings should be systematically applied to all patients on hemodialysis.

### Management of intradialytic hypertension: current evidence and future perspectives [^116yvfSs]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Intradialytic hypertension (IDH), that is, a paradoxical rise in blood pressure (BP) during or immediately after a hemodialysis session, affects approximately 10–15% of the hemodialysis population. It is currently recognized as a phenomenon of major clinical significance as recent studies have shown that BP elevation extends to the whole interdialytic interval and associates with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The pathophysiology of IDH is complex involving volume and sodium overload, endothelial dysfunction, excess renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system activation, and other mechanisms. For several years, there was a scarcity of studies regarding IDH treatment; recently, however, several attempts to examine the effect of nonpharmacological and pharmacological measures on BP levels in IDH are made. This review attempts to summarize this latest evidence in the field of management of IDH and discuss areas for future research.

### Postdialysis blood pressure rise predicts long-term outcomes in chronic hemodialysis patients: a four-year prospective observational cohort study [^1168RU7C]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

BP measurements

Brachial artery BP was measured with the mercury sphygmomanometer in seated position. Predialysis BP was measured at the beginning of HD after 15 minutes of quiet rest. Postdialysis BP was measured at the end of HD 15 minutes after disconnecting from the dialysis circuit. Both predialysis and postdialysis BP were measured in the seated position. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as (SBP + 2 × DBP)/3. Pulse pressure (PP) was calculated from the SBP and DBP (PP = SBP - DBP). Postdialysis BP rise or drop was defined by the difference between postdialysis and predialysis BP values. The variability of postdialysis SBP alteration of each patient was also examined. We first calculated the percentage of postdialysis SBP alteration in each HD sessions as (postdialysis SBP - predialysis SBP)/predialysis SBP * 100%. A total of 25 postdialysis SBP alteration percentages were obtained from each patient. We further calculated the standard deviation of these 25 data, which was defined as the variability of postdialysis SBP alteration of each patient. Ultrafiltration volume was defined as the amount of fluid removed within an HD session. All of the BP values and ultrafiltration volume were averaged from 25 consecutive HD sessions during a 2-month period.

Laboratory measurements

Blood samples were collected before the mid-week HD session. Samples were centrifuged within 1 hour of collection and then immediately sent to the central laboratory for analysis. Laboratory data were recorded as the average of 3 months' data. All measurements were determined in a single central laboratory.

Clinical outcomes

After baseline assessments, all patients were followed for 4 years or until death. Patients who received a kidney transplantation were censored at the time of transplantation. Clinical outcomes were death due to non-cardiovascular etiologies and cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac arrest, fatal arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and stroke. For cardiovascular mortality, patients were also censored at the time of other causes of death. The causes of death were determined by the attending physicians who had no knowledge of patient grouping according to postdialysis BP alterations. In cases of death that did not occur in our hospital, family members were interviewed by telephone to ascertain the cause and time of death.

### Management of intradialytic hypertension: the ongoing challenge [^116J2MwP]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

There is no widely accepted definition of intradialytic hypertension. Arbitrary clinical definitions have included an increase in blood pressure during or immediately after hemodialysis, a rise in blood pressure during the second or third hour of dialysis, and an increase in blood pressure that is resistant to ultrafiltration. To date, no studies have evaluated the prevalence and prognostic importance of intradialytic hypertension. The pathogenesis of intradialytic hypertension is complex and is due in part to extracellular fluid volume expansion, increased cardiac output, activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system, increased circulating vasoactive substances resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction, erythropoietin use, and fluctuations in electrolytes and removal of antihypertensive medications during the dialysis procedure. Management strategies of intradialytic hypertension are based on expert opinion using the pathophysiologic principles described above. We conclude that additional epidemiologic, basic science, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the prevalence, prognostic importance, pathophysiology, and potential treatment of intradialytic hypertension.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in hemodialysis patients: a critique and literature review [^113bLV4J]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring has been in use for nearly four decades. In that time, the advantages of using a more reproducible and accurate method to assess the true contribution of blood pressure to the cardiovascular risk profile of patients have steadily become more clearly established, balanced by the additional expense and expertise involved. In nephrology, and in particular in dialysis patients, there are significant difficulties in accurately registering truly representative blood pressure values and understanding the relationship between blood pressure, end-organ damage, and patient mortality. This arises because of the way in which hemodialysis acutely changes blood pressure values as well as the widespread abnormality of diurnal blood pressure rhythm seen in dialysis patients. Use of ABP monitoring can go some way to overcoming these obstacles. In this review we critically examine the use of ABP monitoring in the understanding of blood pressure control in dialysis patients.

### Hypotension and hypovolemia during hemodialysis: is the usual suspect innocent? [^111NNvo1]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In the current issue, Bitker et al. report the prevalence and risk factors of hypotension during intermittent hemodialysis in ICU patients. Hypotension during intermittent hemodialysis occurs in around 50–60% of critically ill patients and in 25–50% of chronic renal failure patients. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and incompletely understood. In intensive care patients, intradialytic hypotension may cause problems in volume management and metabolic control.

Therapeutic interventions to correct hypotension, if necessary, should be oriented to the pathophysiology rather than to symptoms alone. In chronic hemodialysis patients, risk factors of hypotension include shifts in extracellular volume, osmolarity, and electrolytes, dialysis-induced temperature changes, and altered vasoregulation. Their relevance in ICU patients undergoing hemodialysis is less clear. Even small volume shifts may cause hypotension in ICU patients with limited cardiovascular reserves. Hence, acute volume shifts or sheer hypovolemia and decreased cardiac output may intuitively seem to be likely causes of intradialytic hypotension in the ICU. This assumption is contradicted by Bitker et al. Although hypotension was common (in 57% of 107 sessions), only every fifth hypotensive episode was associated with preload dependence, defined as increased stroke volume following passive leg raising (PLR). The hypotensive episodes were frequent despite proactive control of dialysate temperature and sodium concentration and limited blood flow, known risk factors of intradialysis hypotension. Since hypotension occurred early and after minor ultrafiltration, altered vasomotor tone was considered the likely explanation. This is consistent with observations during chronic hemodialysis. Accordingly, reduced ultrafiltration would not be the most rational intervention, although frequent in clinical practice.

### Challenges in blood pressure measurement in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis [^117DSauq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The association between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing hemodialysis remains controversial. This may relate in part to the technique and device used and the timing of the blood pressure measurement in relation to the hemodialysis procedure. Emerging evidence indicates that standardized hemodialysis unit blood pressure measurements or measurements obtained at home, either by the patient or using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor, may offer advantages over routine hemodialysis unit blood pressure measurements for determining cardiovascular risk and treatment. This review discusses the available evidence and implications for clinicians and clinical trials.

### Association of all-cause mortality with pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure and its peridialytic change in chronic hemodialysis patients [^114yeeD7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular (CV) mortality remains the most common cause of death among hemodialysis (HD) patients. In the general population, high blood pressure (BP) is associated with higher CV risk. Hypertension is common among HD patients with a prevalence between 60% and 90%, and has been associated with increased CV morbidity and mortality. Yet, the association between BP and outcomes in the dialysis population is somewhat controversial. Foley et al. reported that both high and low pre- and post-HD BP were associated with increased mortality among patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis.

Absence of an accepted, 'normal' BP range for dialysis patients is a major barrier for developing definitions for BP-related clinical outcomes. A major concern is the timing of the measurement of clinically actionable BP. While some experts advocate for interdialytic BP measurements (home BP; ambulatory BP monitoring), others favor in-center BP measurements (pre-HD; post-HD; peridialytic BP change) for clinical decision-making. The problem is further compounded by the lack of definitive evidence as to which of these BP measurements are more strongly associated with outcomes. To date, pre- and post-HD BP levels form the basis of the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines. While conflicting data exist, more studies based on large cohorts of patients show elevated mortality in patients with low — rather than high — pre-HD BP, particularly low systolic BP (SBP). To further complicate matters, some large epidemiologic studies using peridialytic SBP change (defined as post-HD minus pre-HD SBP) have shown a U-shaped association with adverse outcomes.

Although during HD a decline in BP is seen in the majority of cases, a peridialytic SBP increase can occur in up to 15% of prevalent HD patients and has been associated with adverse outcomes. Park et al. reported that both large peridialytic SBP falls and rises were associated with higher mortality.

The pathophysiology of both increases and decreases of BP, as well as intradialytic BP variability, is not fully understood and is mostly multifactorial. Factors associated with the development of intradialytic hypotension include, next to fluid removal during dialysis, an impaired vasoreactivity, a reduced sympathetic response, older age, atherosclerosis and poor cardiac reserve. Intradialytic hypertension has been associated with chronic fluid overload, increased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) and intradialytic hypoxemia, among others.

### Modifying the dialysis prescription to reduce intradialytic hypotension [^114HiSuR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The dialysis prescription can have a substantial impact on the frequency of intradialytic hypotension (IDH). Plasma volume will decline to a greater extent when the ultrafiltration (UF) rate is rapid (high interdialytic weight gains and/or short treatment time), favoring IDH. The relationship of the target weight to the euvolemic weight determines the size of the interstitial fluid compartment, which is a major determinant of the rate of plasma refilling during UF. The higher the dialysate sodium, the smaller the decline in plasma volume for any given amount of UF. Use of a dialysate temperature that prevents a positive thermal balance during dialysis will allow peripheral vascular resistance to be maintained and minimize IDH. A higher ionized calcium during treatment facilitates an increase in cardiac output, a benefit that may be particularly notable in patients with depressed cardiac ejection fraction. Low dialysate magnesium, potassium, and bicarbonate may all favor IDH, although insufficient data are available for definitive conclusions. The choice of antihypertensive medication and the treatment schedule must be carefully considered in patients with IDH. The future integration of technology to monitor blood pressure, plasma volume, and thermal and sodium balance into a computer-based biofeedback system will very likely go a long way toward reducing the frequency of IDH.

### Haemodynamic consequences of changing potassium concentrations in haemodialysis fluids [^114325nT]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A rapid decrease of serum potassium concentrations during haemodialysis produces a significant increase in blood pressure parameters at the end of the session, even if effects on intra-dialysis pressure are not seen. Paradoxically, in animal models potassium is a vasodilator and decreases myocardial contractility. The purpose of this trial is to study the precise haemodynamic consequences induced by acute changes in potassium concentration during haemodialysis.

Methods

In 24 patients, 288 dialysis sessions, using a randomised single blind crossover design, we compared six dialysate sequences with different potassium profiles. The dialysis sessions were divided into 3 tertiles, casually modulating potassium concentration in the dialysate between the value normally used K and the two cut-off points K+1 and K-1 mmol/l. Haemodynamics were evaluated in a non-invasive manner using a finger beat-to-beat monitor.

Results

Comparing K-1 and K+1, differences were found within the tertiles regarding systolic (+5.3, +6.6, +2.3 mmHg, p < 0.05, < 0.05, ns) and mean blood pressure (+4.3, +6.4, -0.5 mmHg, p < 0.01, < 0.01, ns), as well as peripheral resistance (+212, +253, -4 dyne.sec.cm-5, p < 0.05, < 0.05, ns). The stroke volume showed a non-statistically-significant inverse trend (-3.1, -5.2, -0.2 ml). 18 hypotension episodes were recorded during the course of the study. 72% with K-1, 11% with K and 17% with K+1 (p < 0.01 for comparison K-1 vs. K and K-1 vs. K+1).

Conclusions

A rapid decrease in the concentration of serum potassium during the initial stage of the dialysis-obtained by reducing the concentration of potassium in the dialysate-translated into a decrease of systolic and mean blood pressure mediated by a decrease in peripheral resistance. The risk of intra-dialysis hypotension inversely correlates to the potassium concentration in the dialysate.

### Blood pressure and volume management in dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^114AZNDW]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, mounting evidence has highlighted blood pressure (BP) and volume status as key mediators of outcomes among individuals receiving maintenance dialysis. – Qualitative data suggest that suboptimal BP and volume management negatively affect quality of life. – Efforts to develop consensus best practices in managing BP and volume in dialysis have been hampered by an absence of widely available, accurate, and objective measures of extracellular volume status, as well as a lack of high-quality evidence. As such, related practice patterns vary considerably, both within local communities and throughout the world.

In February 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference, Blood Pressure and Volume Management in Dialysis, in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference is the second of 4 conferences planned on dialysis (see Chan et al.for the first report, on dialysis initiation). Participants, who included both physicians and patients, considered how BP and volume management can be optimized and individualized across dialysis modalities and resource settings.

### Haemodiafiltration versus high-flux haemodialysis-a consensus statement from the euDial working group of the ERA [^113w9PaU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Key consensus points

CV mortality appears to occur less frequently in patients treated by HDF than in those undergoing high-flux HD. However, this effect cannot be generalized to the entire dialysis population, as its size depends on both the patient's overall health and the delivered convection volume (target > 23 l/session).
There is no difference in the risk of sudden cardiac death between patients treated by HDF and those treated by high-flux HD.
HDF does not reduce the frequency of intradialytic hypotensive episodes compared to high-flux HD.

Rationale

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^116RzMd9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Rationale for guideline 4.2 — blood pressure and extracellular volume management in hemodialysis notes that hypertension affects 60% to 90% of HD patients and that clinical benefits of hypertension treatment in HD have not been established. Considering extracellular volume (ECV) expansion as a contributor to elevated BP, it is the opinion of the Work Group that reducing ECV should be the first line of treatment; achievement of true dry weight is necessary for control of BP, while failure to achieve target dry weight associates with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested whether one method of BP control is superior to another in improving outcomes. The best method to assess achievement of dry weight could be accomplished gradually (over 4–12 weeks or longer), and in the Dry Weight Reduction Intervention (DRIP) trial, 150 HD patients were randomized 2:1 to gradual dry weight reduction (0.1 kg reduction per 10 kg body weight) versus usual care; with an average weight loss of ~1.0 kg, gradual dry weight reduction resulted in an additional ~ 7 mm Hg greater reduction in ambulatory BP at 8 weeks, although adverse events including hypotension and seizures were noted with dry weight probing.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^112bdVDm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis intradialytic hypotension — risks, monitoring, and weight reassessment are highlighted as follows: "Hypotension during dialysis has many adverse effects and potential life-threatening consequences", and "By impairing tissue perfusion, low blood pressures can compromise dialysis adequacy". Overzealous ultrafiltration "may contribute to loss of RKF and, in predisposed patients, coronary and/or cerebral ischemia". To mitigate this, "dry weight should be systematically reevaluated after each dialysis treatment". For longitudinal tracking, "It was suggested that a dialysis log summarizing the relevant information, such as body weights, blood pressures, and intradialytic incidents, is essential to provide a longitudinal dynamic view of ECF volume and blood pressure changes". Blood volume monitoring "has been recommended", although device performance has shown "varying degrees of success" with both "satisfactory results" and "disappointing results", and "Further studies are required to clarify this important issue". Some patients may require altered ultrafiltration schedules, as "Some patients may require slow ultrafiltration during a longer time than 4 hours 3 times weekly".

### How can we prevent intradialytic hypotension? [^111HCBJx]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) produces uncomfortable symptoms for the patient and reduces the efficiency of dialysis.

Recent Findings

IDH may be an important cause of vascular access thrombosis. Automatic biofeedback-controlled dialysis changes dialysate conductivity and ultrafiltration during dialysis. A number of trials suggest that automatic feedback-controlled dialysis improves IDH in part by improvement in myocardial stunning and preservation of cardiac function. However, the effects of automatic biofeedback dialysis are inconsistent between studies and sample sizes are small. Acetate even in small amounts may trigger IDH especially in predisposed patients. Cool temperature dialysate causes vasoconstriction, activates the sympathetic nervous system, preserves central blood volume, and mitigates IDH. Increasing the treatment time to at least 4h three times a week and limiting dialysate and dietary sodium intake are effective ways to reduce IDH. Ultrafiltration profiling needs further work, but it appears that removing more fluid during the first hour of dialysis and reducing the rate later on may also reduce IDH.

Summary

Adequate prescription and frequency of dialysis treatments, limiting dietary and dialysate sodium, ultrafiltration profiling, automatic biofeedback-controlled dialysis, avoidance of acetate, and cool temperature dialysate may be effective strategies to reduce IDH.

Dialysis hypertension diagnosis and blood pressure (BP) measurement — For patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, EURECA-m specifies modality-specific methods and hypertension thresholds. For ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), use a minimum of 24-h monitoring without dialysis; when feasible, 44-h midweek interdialytic monitoring, and define hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. For home BP, average readings from both morning and evening over 6 nondialysis days (hemodialysis) or over 7 consecutive days (peritoneal dialysis), with hypertension defined as ≥ 135/85 mm Hg. For office BP, measure midweek on a nondialysis day and average 3 readings; hypertension is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. All measurements should follow a 5-minute rest with the patient sitting and with back and arm supported.

### Blood pressure measurement in hemodialysis patients [^115MkDnA]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Measurement of blood pressure (BP) poses some unique challenges in hemodialysis patients. Timing of BP measurement in relation to dialysis, changes in interdialytic weight gain, and inconsistent BP measurement technique in dialysis units contribute to the variability of BP readings in this population. This may contribute to the equivocal relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes documented in several epidemiologic studies in this population. Home BP readings are promising, but need to be validated as a measure of the burden of hypertension in this population. It is important to standardize BP measurement in all hemodialysis units according to published guidelines to improve the management of hypertension. Future research studies should carefully validate the technique used to measure BP.

### Rationale and design of the sodium lowering in dialysate (SoLID) trial: a randomised controlled trial of low versus standard dialysate sodium concentration during hemodialysis for regression of left ventricular mass [^111DgLno]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

There is a range of clinical evidence that supports the crucial role of for LV hypertrophy in SCD among dialysis patients. In a multitude of studies, the presence of LV hypertrophy is a strong independent mortality risk. In a landmark study, LV hypertrophy was associated with a relative risk for death of 2.9, even when adjusted for age, known coronary artery disease, diabetes, and blood pressure (BP). Of equal importance, recent studies have demonstrated that that the effect of lipid lowering therapy is attenuated in patients with kidney disease, reinforcing the lesser role of sudden rupture of lipid rich plaques as a mechanism of SCD in this group. On balance, LV hypertrophy is regarded as a prime and causal risk factor for SCD, and the regression of LV hypertrophy accepted as a validated surrogate primary end point for interventions aiming to reduce CV mortality in dialysis patients.

Persistently elevated blood pressure (BP) and extra-cellular fluid (ECF) overload due to positive salt and water balance are significant contributors to on-going LV hypertrophy with conventional (non-extended-hours) dialysis. Current methods to control these factors with either drug therapy or ultra-filtration in patients on conventional dialysis can be effective but are often inadequate in routine clinical practice. The most effective intervention to improve LV hypertrophy is extended-hours or frequent HD. A randomised controlled trial of extended-hours HD demonstrated a 7.7% reduction in LV mass over a 6month period for patients dialysed in this manner, as opposed to a stable LV mass in those dialysed conventionally. Similar findings were published in the Frequent Haemodialysis Network trial. In both studies, regression of LV mass was associated with improved measures of BP and ECF volume control. Several observational studies have reported similar findings.

### Effect of cool vs. warm dialysate on toxin removal: rationale and study design [^116QuPJ6]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Improving toxin removal can potentially improve the hemodialysis (HD) patient outcome. In this context, the decades old HD procedure progressed from low efficiency low-flux dialysis to high efficiency high-flux dialysis and currently towards increased acceptance for convection based hemodiafiltration (HDF). However, in all these extracorporeal renal replacement therapies, toxin removal is primarily impaired by inter-compartmental resistance. Overcoming this resistance seems to be the single most effective method for improved toxin removal. Intra-dialytic exercise may reduce this resistance by vasodilation. Exercise increases the cardiac output and reduces peripheral vascular resistance as the vasculature dilates. This vasodilation may be augmented by increased body core temperature due to exercise. However, intra-dialytic exercise is still considered an intervention in routine dialysis setting, not a norm. Also, HD patients with significant muscle wasting may not be able to exercise during dialysis. How then can we induce the vasodilation without exercise or can we increase the body core temperature without exercise?

Dialysate temperature is an easy maneuver which can change the blood temperature, a surrogate of body core temperature. Warm dialysate can increase the body core temperature, resulting in vasodilation and increased mobilization of sequestered toxins to intravascular compartment. The contrary physiological change i.e. vasoconstriction can similarly be induced by cool dialysate and this is often recommended for prevention of intra-dialytic hypotensive (IDH) episodes. IDH is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg or a drop of more than 20 mmHg that results in clinical symptoms, and occurs in 20–30% of treatments. Cool dialysate induced vasoconstriction may reduce the toxin mobilization from remote inaccessible body compartments to intravascular compartment, thus hindering the toxin removal, which is contrary to the fundamental objective of HD. Hence, although cool dialysate helps in prevention of intra-dialytic episodes in short-term, prolonged usage may lead to poor patient outcome by impaired toxin removal. If cool dialysate does hinder toxin removal, then for at least 70–80% non-hypotensive HD patients, the benefits of warm dialysate may be realized.

### Special situations: intradialytic hypertension / chronic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension [^115dMH17]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a comorbidity that is present in the majority of end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis. This population is particularly unique because of the dynamic nature of blood pressure (BP) during dialysis. Modest BP decreases are expected in most hemodialysis patients, but intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic hypertension are two special situations that deviate from this as either an exaggerated or paradoxical response to the dialysis procedure. Both of these phenomena are particularly important because they are associated with increased mortality risk compared to patients with modest decreases in BP during dialysis. While the detailed pathophysiology is complex, intradialytic hypotension occurs more often in patients prescribed fast ultrafiltration rates, and reducing this rate is recommended in patients that regularly exhibit this pattern. Patients with intradialytic hypertension have a poorly explained increase in vascular resistance during dialysis, but the consistent associations with extracellular volume overload point toward more aggressive fluid management as the initial management choices for these patients. This up to date review provides the most recent evidence supporting these recommendations as well as the most up to date epidemiologic and mechanistic research studies that have added to this area of dialysis management.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^114j1Tnq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) targets in PD — observational data indicate higher mortality in people with systolic BP < 111 mm Hg but no effect of higher BPs up to a systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg; a longer term study demonstrated a lower risk of death for those with higher BP in the first 6 months of PD, no effect through year 5, and then higher mortality thereafter; consequently, it has been suggested that BP targets in persons treated with PD be relaxed to accept a systolic BP up to 159 mm Hg while avoiding hypotension, and there is no general recommendation for managing BP in people with PD at this time.

### Cardiac arrest and sudden death in dialysis units [^111oUkvU]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

For patients with end-stage renal disease and their providers, dialysis unit-based cardiac arrest is the most feared complication of hemodialysis. However, relatively little is known regarding its frequency or epidemiology, or whether a fraction of these events could be prevented.

Methods

To explore clinical correlates of dialysis unit-based cardiac arrest, 400 reported arrests over a nine-month period from October 1998 through June 1999 were reviewed in detail. Clinical characteristics of patients who suffered cardiac arrest were compared with a nationally representative cohort of > 77,000 hemodialysis patients dialyzed at Fresenius Medical Care North America-affiliated facilities.

Results

The cardiac arrest rate was 400 out of 5,744,708, corresponding to a rate of 7 per 100,000 hemodialysis sessions. Cardiac arrest was more frequent during Monday dialysis sessions than on other days of the week. Case patients were nearly twice as likely to have been dialyzed against a 0 or 1.0 mEq/L potassium dialysate on the day of cardiac arrest (17.1 vs. 8.8%). Patients who suffered a cardiac arrest were on average older (66.3 ± 12.9 vs. 60.2 ± 15.4 years), more likely to have diabetes (61.8 vs. 46.8%), and more likely to use a catheter for vascular access (34.1 vs. 27.8%) than the general hemodialysis population. Sixteen percent of patients experienced a drop in systolic pressure of 30 mm Hg or more prior to the arrest. Thirty-seven percent of patients who suffered cardiac arrest had been hospitalized within the past 30 days. Sixty percent of patients died within 48 hours of the arrest, including 13% while in the dialysis unit.

Conclusions

Cardiac arrest is a relatively infrequent but devastating complication of hemodialysis. To reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events on hemodialysis, the dialysate prescription should be evaluated and modified on an ongoing basis, especially following hospitalization in high-risk patients.

### Definitions of intradialytic hypotension [^113nZbhF]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common and often distressful complication of hemodialysis. However, despite its clinical significance, there is no consensus, evidence-based medical definition for the condition. Over the years, numerous definitions have been implemented in both the clinical and research settings. Definition inconsistencies have hindered data synthesis and the development of evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and treatment of IDH, as well as prevented accurate estimation of the population burden of IDH and patient risk assessment. Most existing IDH definitions are comprised of one or more of the following components: (1) intradialytic BP criteria (requisite BP declines or minimum BP thresholds), (2) the provision of interventions aimed at restoring effective arterial volume, and/or (3) patient-reported symptoms. Remarkably, there are insufficient data to inform IDH definition construction, and it remains unknown if a single, universal definition can adequately capture the condition across patient subgroups, and in clinical and research settings.

### Blood pressure targets for hemodialysis patients [^113S1Wbj]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The association between blood pressure (BP) and mortality is unique in hemodialysis patients compared with that in the general population. This is because of an altered benefit-risk balance associated with BP reduction in these patients. An adequately designed study comparing BP targets in hemodialysis patients remains to be conducted. The current evidence available to guide dialysis providers regarding treatment strategies for managing hypertension in this population is limited to large observational studies and small randomized controlled trials. In this opinion article, we review these data and discuss the key points regarding BP management for hemodialysis patients. Our aim is to provide a practical opinion regarding BP targets that nephrologists can incorporate into clinical practice, with a focus on moving away from dialysis unit BPs and focusing on out-of-dialysis unit BPs.

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^114UuLNa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The notion of treatment effect heterogeneity for common interventions in high-risk patients is not unprecedented in cardiovascular medicine. An example of this within an individual trial can be found in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial, where there was a significant association of heart failure class and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy with mortality. Patients with New York Heart Association class III heart failure derived no benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy but those with New York Heart Association class II heart failure benefited greatly. The 5-year mortality rates in the New York Heart Association classes III and II placebo groups were 46% and 32%, respectively. This same dynamic can be seen across trials as well. In the Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis trial, a high-risk population of dialysis patients derived no benefit from statin therapy. The rates of death and nonfatal MI in the control group of this population were 14 per 100 person-years and 2.5 per 100 person-years, respectively. Contrary to this, in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An International Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin trial, a much lower risk population of patients who were in generally good health derived a significant benefit from statin therapy. The same rates of death and nonfatal MI in the control group of this population were 1.25 per 100 person-years and 0.33 per 100 person-years, respectively.

In the recently published International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease trial, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease derived no benefit from an invasive compared with conservative strategy and were more likely to experience a stroke or a composite of death from any cause or initiation of dialysis. The 3-year rates of death and nonfatal MI in the control group of this population were 27.8% and 15.9%, respectively. In the main trial, which excluded CKD patients with chronic kidney disease, fewer events were experienced in the invasive group, and there was a significant reduction in angina and no evidence of harm. The 3-year rates of death and nonfatal MI in the control group of this population were 4.3% and 8.5%, respectively.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^112A782n]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and ACE inhibitor/ARB considerations in hemodialysis (HD) — it is now generally accepted that the decrease in renal function observed in most patients treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is reversible and reno-protective, even in patients with CKD stage 5; however, the drug-induced decrease in GFR causes an increase in levels of BUN, creatinine, and other solutes and may decrease urine output, and irreversible loss of renal function may occur in patients with ischemic renal disease treated with ACE inhibitors. Severe hypertension is well known to damage normal kidneys acutely and can cause ongoing damage over years, and control of hypertension after initiating dialysis therapy has been associated with improvement in RKF, sometimes allowing discontinuation of dialysis therapy; these patients should be identified from the beginning, and special attention should be given to controlling blood pressure for the purpose of preserving and possibly improving RKF.

### Intermittent hemodialysis as a rewarming strategy for severe hypothermia in patients without renal failure: a case report [^1126ZwTy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

When using IHD to treat patients for hypothermia or poisoning caused by dialyzable toxins in patients without renal dysfunction and/ or hyperkalemia, there is no need for any net potassium removal. In such situations, it is appropriate to use a dialysate potassium (K) concentration of 4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range, if available. In our case, the patient received potassium of 60 mEq in the emergency department, and at the time of IHD, a 4 K bath was unavailable, so a 3 K bath was utilized.

It is essential to be aware of the risk of hazardous core temperature after-drop when actively rewarming a hypothermic patient. This complication may occur when both the patient's extremities and trunk are warmed simultaneously. The problem is that the cold, acidic blood that has pooled in the narrowed blood vessels of the extremities returns to the core circulation, causing the temperature and pH to drop further. Additionally, the transition from the cold environment to a warmer one causes the peripheral blood vessels to dilate, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure, inadequate blood supply to the heart, and even ventricular fibrillation. This may explain why some patients experience fatal heart rhythms during rewarming. However, combining active core rewarming techniques with active external rewarming can help minimize the risk of rewarming shock and after-drop in patients with severe hypothermia. In the event of an after drop, pressor support can be used to maintain appropriate blood pressure while continuing with the warming process.

We conducted an analysis incorporating our case with eight previously reported case of severe hypothermia without renal dysfunction treated via hemodialysis, detailed in Table 3. The observed average rewarming rate during hemodialysis was 1.88 °C per hour, which is consistent with the results reported by Mendrala et al. An important prognostic factor identified is that delays in the rewarming process are closely associated with increased mortality rates. D.F. Danzl et al. performed a retrospective study of hypothermia outcomes over 25 years ago, factors linked to death within 24 h included prehospital cardiac arrest, low or absent blood pressure upon arrival, high blood urea nitrogen levels, and the requirement for endotracheal intubation.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^113Rw8ps]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Maintenance dialysis — BP goals and evidence signals: The 2012 KDIGO BP guideline and the ACC/AHA guideline do not recommend BP goals in patients receiving maintenance dialysis due to lack of evidence, and the subsequent 2012 KDIGO BP in CKD guideline elected to not address hypertension diagnosis or management in the setting of dialysis due to lack of sufficient evidence. Most observational data from the dialysis population show a "U"- or "J"-shaped relationship between BP and mortality. The 2005 K/DOQI guideline for CVD in dialysis patients made a grade C recommendation for a predialysis BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg and a postdialysis BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg, but acknowledged the lack of strong evidence supporting any specific BP threshold for initiating and titrating antihypertensive medications or for reducing dry weight.

### Low dialysate sodium and 48-h ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension: a randomized crossover study [^115wkiFG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is the most common risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing hemodialysis with an estimated prevalence around 85%, and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events.

Sodium and water removal during the hemodialysis session represents a major determinant of blood pressure (BP) fluctuations in ESKD; as such, the usual trajectory of BP levels through the intra- and interdialytic interval is a decrease in BP during hemodialysis, as a response to ultrafiltration, followed by a more gradual increase during the interdialytic interval. However, apart from this specific pattern of BP change during dialysis, a smaller subset of patients experience a diverse response, i.e. a "paradoxical" rise in BP during or immediately after dialysis which is usually referred to as intradialytic hypertension (IDH).

Over the course of the last decade, accumulating evidence demonstrated that IDH is a phenomenon that occurs in approximately 10%–15% of the dialysis population, while patients with IDH exhibit an increased risk for cardiovascular events, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, compared to patients exhibiting the usual pattern of BP fall during dialysis. The pathophysiological background of this condition is multifactorial and several mechanisms have been proposed to be implicated in the development of IDH. Among them, volume and sodium overload are listed among the important contributors to the pathogenesis of the phenomenon.

Previous studies in patients with IDH attempted to decrease intradialytic sodium gain and subsequently BP rise through modification of dialysate sodium. In a randomized crossover study in 16 patients with IDH, low dialysate sodium concentration was associated with lower intradialytic systolic BP (SBP) over a 1-week period compared with high (5 mEq/L higher than serum sodium) dialysate sodium. A non-randomized study examined the effect of low (136 mEq/L) compared with standard (140 mEq/L) dialysate sodium on peridialytic and intradialytic BP, with similar results. The only previous study using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), evaluated 11 patients with IDH to assess the effect of individualized isonatremic vs hyponatremic vs standard dialysate sodium of 140 mEq/L, showing a reduction in 24-h BP during the hyponatremic phase.

### Postdialysis blood pressure rise predicts long-term outcomes in chronic hemodialysis patients: a four-year prospective observational cohort study [^117XySWz]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The blood pressure (BP) of a proportion of chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients rises after HD. We investigated the influence of postdialysis BP rise on long-term outcomes.

Methods

A total of 115 prevalent HD patients were enrolled. Because of the fluctuating nature of predialysis and postdialysis BP, systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP before and after HD were recorded from 25 consecutive HD sessions during a 2-month period. Patients were followed for 4 years or until death or withdrawal.

Results

Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that patients with average postdialysis SBP rise of more than 5 mmHg were at the highest risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as compared to those with an average postdialysis SBP change between -5 to 5 mmHg and those with an average postdialysis SBP drop of more than 5 mmHg. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that both postdialysis SBP rise of more than 5 mmHg (HR, 3.925 [95% CI, 1.410–10.846], p = 0.008) and high cardiothoracic (CT) ratio of more than 50% (HR, 7.560 [95% CI, 2.048–27.912], p = 0.002) independently predicted all-cause mortality. We also found that patients with an average postdialysis SBP rise were associated with subclinical volume overload, as evidenced by the significantly higher CT ratio (p = 0.008).

Conclusions

A postdialysis SBP rise in HD patients independently predicted 4-year cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Considering postdialysis SBP rise was associated with higher CT ratio, intensive evaluation of cardiac and volume status should be performed in patients with postdialysis SBP rise.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114NNzWY]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the quality of dialysis prescription, intra-dialytic hypotension will still occur, in some patients more than others, for which prompt nursing intervention is essential. Common measures include leg raised positioning, ceasing ultrafiltration, and fluid administration (saline being as good as albumin and far cheaper). Measures for "simple" intra-dialytic hypotension should be coupled with assessment for underlying intercurrent illness (such as infection or cardiac arrhythmia) or less commonly a specific dialysis complication (such as air embolism or dialyser reaction). Frequent intervention should lead to re-assessment of target weight / ultrafiltration setting and a medication review - in some cases predialysis hypertension may be preferable to dialysis intolerance. Specific pharmacological measures are rarely used but the alfa-agonist Midodrine has reasonable supportive evidence: in meta-analysis the average improvement (increase) in systolic/diastolic post-dialysis blood pressure was 12.4/7.7mmHg.

Guideline 4.2 - Paediatric fluid considerations

In growing children we recommend clinical assessment of fluid status and target weight, and dietetic assessment, at least monthly. [1C]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment with a validated objective measure of fluid status such as bioimpedance, on a monthly basis or more frequently during periods of rapid growth or illness. [2C]

We recommend regular assessment of ultrafiltration tolerance, using extended times to avoid excessive ultrafiltration rates. [1D]

Rationale

Assessment of target weight in children and adolescents is particularly challenging as it needs frequent adjustment in line with growth or periods of illness. This is particularly true for infants and adolescents during rapid phases of growth. Overestimation of target weight will result in chronic fluid overload leading to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas chronic under-hydration is likely to detrimentally affect residual kidney function and lead to increased symptomatic hypotension both during and immediately post-dialysis. Hypotensive tendency is also multifactorial and cannot alone be relied on to ascertain a patient's target weight. It is therefore essential that target weight is adjusted at least on a monthly basis following clinical assessment, in conjunction with dietetic review.

### Serious adverse events in patients with target-oriented blood pressure management: a systematic review [^112D8z74]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of serious adverse events

Only the ACCORD and SPRINT studies provided a definition of serious adverse events that conformed to the definition from the ICH Working Group. All the other studies had unclear definitions of serious adverse events (Supplementary Table 3).

Moreover, often, each particular serious adverse event was either not clearly defined or not reported. In the SPRINT study, hypotension was defined as a symptomatic low blood pressure without specific blood pressure cut-offs; syncope was a sudden temporary loss of consciousness; and an injurious fall was a fall that resulted in either an emergency department evaluation or hospitalization. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported when it was listed in the hospital discharge summary or noted in the emergency department. In the VALISH study, an AKI was defined as a doubling of serum creatinine to a level more than 2.0 mg per 100 mL or the introduction of dialysis.

### The lived experiences of patients undergoing hemodialysis with the concept of care: a phenomenological study [^112uJkVM]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

High-quality dialysis

Since hemodialysis is very sensitive process, patient care and control during dialysis is important. Thus, a meticulous care during dialysis is highly important for the participants:

'Some personnel don't set up the machine based on my condition and my blood pressure drops'. (Participant 7)

'Every time during dialysis they control my blood pressure five times; I'm afraid of drops in my blood pressure during dialysis; I have spasm in my legs'. (Participant 13)

An unbroken or advanced dialysis machine was another issue that the participants referred to and stated that a high-quality dialysis is almost impossible without a well-functioning dialysis machine:

'The machines are broken and don't lose weight well; we're thirsty between two dialysis; we drink water and get short of breath; our pressure drops under the dialysis; they disconnect us quickly from the machine and going home we are not well'. (Participant 4)

Accordingly, the participants considered high-quality dialysis as a part of care and emphasized the importance of a meticulous care during dialysis and the proper functioning of the dialysis machines.

Based on the results of the research, the lived experience of dialysis patients shows that care for these patients means empathy, accompaniment in meeting daily needs, social support and concern, and high-quality dialysis. These concepts thus have to be considered in the care plans designed for these patients by the medical staff, domiciliary caregivers and social agents.

Technical intradialytic strategies for managing BP and volume

Temperature biofeedback.

Cooling the dialysate temperature through various methods (e.g. lowering temperature relative to measured body temperature or lowering temperature to a set threshold — 35 °C or 36 °C — irrespective of body temperature) has been associated with hemodynamic stability, – and lowering temperature to 0.5 °C below body temperature is well tolerated by most patients. An ongoing trial (MY TEMP,) is evaluating the effect of dialysate cooling on cardiovascular events.

Blood volume monitoring.

Evidence is conflicting regarding whether relative blood volume monitoring can predict intradialytic hypotension –; however, evidence suggests that relative blood volume monitoring is of prognostic value. In the randomized Crit-Line Intradialytic Monitoring Benefit (CLIMB) trial, mortality and hospitalization rates were higher among patients undergoing intradialytic blood volume monitoring versus conventional clinical monitoring. However, the interpretation of the trial is limited by the atypically low hospitalization and mortality rates and questions regarding study protocol adherence. In children, although there are no RCT data, evidence indicates that a relative blood volume–guided UF algorithm improves BP control.

UF profiling.

RCT data on UF profiling, independent of relative blood volume monitoring and sodium profiling, are scarce, with a crossover RCT published in 2000 demonstrating no benefit.

Isolated UF.

Isolated UF is commonly used, but currently there is limited evidence to support this approach.

Sodium profiling.

Although data to support sodium profiling are scant, one meta-analysis suggests that stepwise versus linear sodium profiling is associated with greater hemodynamic stability. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) suggest that the routine use of sodium modelling/profiling to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension is associated with increased all-cause mortality. Sodium profiling must be used judiciously, as it may result in sodium loading and hypervolemia.

Bioimpedance.

Data from a study of 15 patients indicate that bioimpedance may have a role for assessing the relationship between plasma refilling and tissue hydration during dialysis, but evidence is currently insufficient to justify routine use for intradialytic volume management. As reported above, bioimpedance may have a role in extracellular volume management.

Hemodiafiltration.

Convective therapies such as hemodiafiltration may have a role in preventing intradialytic hypotension. An RCT including 146 patients demonstrated a significant reduction in intradialytic hypotension in the hemodiafiltration group compared with regular HD, and others have demonstrated better hemodynamic stability with increasing convection volume prescriptions. Further research is needed.

### Intradialytic hypertension: a less-recognized cardiovascular complication of hemodialysis [^1142A2x2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypertension, defined as an increase in blood pressure during or immediately after hemodialysis that results in postdialysis hypertension, has long been recognized to complicate the hemodialysis procedure, yet often is largely ignored. In light of recent investigations suggesting that intradialytic hypertension is associated with adverse outcomes, this review broadly covers the epidemiologic characteristics, prognostic significance, potential pathogenic mechanisms, prevention, and possible treatment of intradialytic hypertension. Intradialytic hypertension affects up to 15% of hemodialysis patients and occurs more frequently in patients who are older, have lower dry weights, are prescribed more antihypertensive medications, and have lower serum creatinine levels. Recent studies associated intradialytic hypertension independently with higher hospitalization rates and decreased survival. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms of intradialytic hypertension are uncertain, it likely is multifactorial and includes subclinical volume overload, sympathetic overactivity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelial cell dysfunction, and specific dialytic techniques. Prevention and treatment of intradialytic hypertension may include careful attention to dry weight, avoidance of dialyzable antihypertensive medications, limiting the use of high-calcium dialysate, achieving adequate sodium solute removal during hemodialysis, and using medications that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or decrease endothelin 1 levels. In summary, although intradialytic hypertension often is underappreciated, recent studies suggest that it should not be ignored. However, further work is necessary to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of intradialytic hypertension and its appropriate management and determine whether treatment of intradialytic hypertension can improve clinical outcomes.

### Management of blood pressure in adults, children and young people on dialysis: UK kidney association clinical practice guideline [^115jQ7Po]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that dialysis patients may omit prescribed antihypertensives prior to haemodialysis sessions, either on advice of healthcare professionals or by their own decision. We were unable to find evidence to support this practice. However, it is reasonable to assume that, where a person takes one or more antihypertensive medications early in the morning on 4 days of the week and 6 or more hours later than this on the remaining 3 days, this may increase BP variability. Observational studies have established increased short- and long-term BP variability as independent predictors of all-cause and CV mortality and major adverse CV events in people on haemodialysis. Considering that the TIME study found that evening dosing of antihypertensive medication did not differ from morning dosing in terms of major CV outcomes in the general population, we suggest that clinicians discourage omission of antihypertensives prior to dialysis sessions and instead encourage consistent night-time dosing of antihypertensive medication in those patients for whom such medication is thought to be contributory to IDH. We acknowledge that the efficacy of this approach should be tested in a clinical trial.

We found limited evidence to support pharmacological approaches to management of IDH. Evidence to support the use of midodrine is inconclusive. A meta-analysis, published in 2004, included 10 studies with 117 participants and reported nadir BP 13.3/5.9 mmHg higher in those receiving midodrine, but no consistent benefit in terms of symptom reduction. All included studies had significant methodological flaws (e.g. none were of parallel group design) and were subjective to substantial risk of bias. A retrospective cohort study of 3083 patients, albeit not necessarily with confirmed IDH and subject to confounding by indication, found an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.37, 1.31 and 1.41 for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization and hospitalization for CV causes respectively for those prescribed midodrine vs. controls.

Prevalence of dialysis hypotension at patient level

Since the occurrence of dialysis hypotension may not be evenly distributed over patients, we also analyzed which proportion of patients fulfilled the separate items as well as the full EBPG definition. We specifically analyzed which proportion of patients fulfilled the EBPG criteria for IDH in 0 to 10%, in 10 to 20% or in > 20% of dialysis sessions. We found that 89.9% of patients had a decrease in SBP of ≥ 20 mmHg in more than 20% of dialysis sessions (Table 3). As much as 96.8% of patients had either a decrease in SBP of ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in MAP ≥ 10 in more than 20% of dialysis sessions.

Table 3

Ten (8.1%) patients fulfilled the full EBPG definition of dialysis hypotension in more than 20% of dialysis sessions (Table 3).

Similar analyses were performed for alternative cut-offs for SBP showing that 74.2% of patients had a decrease in SBP ≥ 30 mmHg and 52.4% of patients had a decrease in SBP ≥ 40 mmHg in more than 20% of the dialysis sessions. A total of 6.5% of patients had a decrease in SBP ≥ 30 mmHg in combination with a clinical event and a nursing intervention in more that 20% of dialysis sessions; 5.6% of patients had a decrease in SBP ≥ 40 mmHg in combination with a clinical event and a nursing intervention in more than 20% of dialysis sessions.

### Prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117Tx46M]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

According to studies the frequency of SCD increases with the time of dialysis treatment and with the time that passed from their previous dialysis session and it is highest among individuals with diabetes. It was observed that the frequency of deaths of HD patients was higher than the expected ratio in the 12 h period from the beginning of dialysis treatment and on the last day of the dialysis-free weekend interval. The rate of cardiac arrest among patients with diabetes who were undergoing dialysis was 110 events per 1,000 patient-years at year one and rose to 208 events per 1,000 patient-years at year four. In the already mentioned study by Herzog et al. the survival rates after cardiac arrest were 32% at 30 days and 17% at 1 year after dialysis and dropped to 13% at 1 year in patients with diabetes.

Among other risk factors for SCD it is worth mentioning the hospitalization within 30 days after dialysis and a decrease of 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during hemodialysis. Moreover, patients with ESRD and diabetes are at higher risk of sudden death than non-diabetic ESRD patients.

Previous studies have noted a number of factors occurring with HD that could lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD since changes associated with renal failure and hemodialysis-related disorders overlap. It was revealed that ventricular arrhythmia is present in 90% and supraventricular arrhythmia in 80% of dialysis patients. Cardiac arrhythmias are exacerbated by dialysis and several hours after it. During dialysis, many changes occur that favor electrical instability, including disturbances in serum electrolytes, variations in various metabolite concentrations, acid–base balance alterations, the decrease in circulating blood volume, sympathetic overactivity as well as inflammation and possibly iron deposition. Too low concentration of potassium in the dialysate, diabetes mellitus, advanced age and dialysis performed after the weekend break are important factors that increase the risk of SCD. The study by Karnik et al. showed that patients who died in the first 12 h interval had a lower mean serum potassium level in the prior monthly tests than those dying in the 60–72 h interval. Moreover, iron overload in ESRD increases the risk of SCD due to QT prolongation.

### Impact of drugs on intradialytic hypotension: antihypertensives and vasoconstrictors [^112HQeG7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication of hemodialysis and is associated with numerous adverse outcomes including cardiovascular events, inadequate dialysis, loss of vascular access, and death. It is estimated that approximately 20%-30% of all dialysis sessions are affected by IDH. In seeking ways to reduce the occurrence of IDH, dialysis providers often turn to pharmacological approaches: withholding antihypertensive medications prior to hemodialysis or administering vasoconstrictor medications. This review will focus on what is known about the relation between antihypertensive medications and IDH, and summarize studies that have examined the efficacy of vasoconstrictor medications on IDH, including midodrine, arginine vasopressin, and droxidopa. However, there is currently scant evidence that any pharmacological approach is particularly effective in reducing IDH. Additional studies of potential treatments for IDH are needed, and should examine not only hemodynamic effects such as changes in nadir blood pressure during dialysis, but also on patient-centered and clinical outcomes such as symptoms of IDH, quality of life, and cardiovascular events.

### Blood pressure variability among chronic dialysis patients: recent advances in knowledge [^111PdB2W]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent evidence linking blood pressure variability (BPV) to adverse clinical outcomes in the chronic hemodialysis patient population.

Recent Findings

BPV is an increasingly recognized poor prognostic factor in the general population. A growing body of evidence suggests that both short-term and long-term BPV are associated with adverse events among chronic dialysis patients. Over the last 18 months, several studies have linked long-term BPV (considered dialysis treatment to dialysis treatment) to all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Similar results have been demonstrated for short-term (considered as intradialytic) BPV and clinical outcomes. Further studies substantiating these findings and examining potential BPV mitigation strategies are needed. Additionally, a BPV metric that is easily calculated and tracked in the clinical setting is necessary before BPV can become a routine component of clinical monitoring.

Summary

Recent observational data demonstrate an association between short-term and long-term BPV and adverse outcomes among chronic hemodialysis patients. Further research is needed to identify strategies that mitigate this risk and to translate these findings into clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^116bWpf3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis access pressure monitoring — measurements of pressure from the HD circuit were not originally designed to assess access dysfunction and are now used to determine whether the prescribed dialyzer blood flow can be delivered without generating excessive negative pressures. At high negative pressures, displaced flow by up to 15% may occur and excessively negative pressures can result in hemolysis. The pressure required to infuse blood back into the access is recorded as the venous drip chamber pressure (VDP) or DVP, and there still is no alarm for detecting accidental withdrawal of the needle outside the body; exsanguinations have occurred.

Prevalence of hypotension, clinical events and nursing interventions

As much as 63.8% of dialysis sessions were complicated by a decrease in SPB of ≥ 20 mmHg (Table 2). A decrease in MAP ≥ 10 mmHg occurred in 71.2% of dialysis sessions. A decrease in SBP of ≥ 20 mmHg or MAP ≥ 10 was present in 77.7% of dialysis sessions.

Values are given as number (percentage)

The total number of patients with clinical events and nursing interventions is lower than the separate items since some patients had more than one clinical event and/or intervention

Abbreviations: BP blood pressure, SBP systolic blood pressure. MAP mean arterial blood pressure

A total of 21.4% of dialysis sessions was complicated by a clinical event. The most frequent clinical event was muscle cramp, occurring in 8.8% of dialysis sessions (Table 2). Nursing interventions were carried out in 8.5% of dialysis sessions. The most frequent nursing intervention was stop of ultrafiltration, which was applied in 7.0% of dialysis sessions.

Figure 3 shows the relations and overlap of the 3 components of the EBPG definition of IDH. Notably, in most (58.2%) dialysis sessions that fulfilled the hypotension component of the EBPG definition, there was no clinical event or intervention. In another 11.7% of dialysis sessions that fulfilled the hypotension component of the definition, a clinical event occurred but no nursing intervention was carried out. A combination of a decrease in SBP of ≥ 20 mmHg or MAP ≥ 10 mmHg with a clinical event and nursing intervention (full EBPG definition) occurred in 6.7% of dialysis sessions. Of the dialysis sessions, 3.0% were complicated by a clinical event without fulfilling the hypotension component of the definition. In 0.5% of dialysis sessions, both a clinical event occurred and a nursing intervention was performed without fulfilling the hypotension component of the definition.

### Low achieved systolic blood pressure related to kidney protection in diabetic and non-diabetic high-risk hypertensive patients [^1129H9DC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants were followed for 4–6 years to a maximum of 72 months, with monthly visits during the initial six months after randomization and later at six-month intervals. BP was measured at each visit using a calibrated sphygmomanometer or validated digital device with an appropriate size cuff as required by the protocol though the choice of measurement device was not harmonized between study centers because VALUE was not primarily a BP study but a hypertension outcome trial.

Patients were seated quietly for 5 min before the measurement of such standard research BP. BP was measured in the morning, 24 hours after the last dosing. Measurements were performed 3 times during each visit. Mean BP at each visit was defined as the average of all 3 readings. Monitoring was performed by the Novartis Medical Department with headquarters in Basel, Switzerland and East Hanover, NJ, USA, known for their strict monitoring routines including high quality-work with source data verification.

Blood samples were collected and analyzed at central labs located in Europe, North and South America, Israel, Australia, and South-Africa. Serum creatinine was measured at baseline and thereafter yearly.

Kidney and cardiovascular outcomes

The primary goal of the studywas to determine the time to the occurrence of the first cardiac event, which included a combination of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, death from revascularization procedures or heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, and emergency procedures to prevent myocardial infarction. The secondary endpoints were all cardiovascular events, fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalized heart failure, cardiovascular-, non-cardiovascular-, and all-cause mortality. Pre-specified secondary kidney endpointsincluded worsened kidney function by at least a 50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline, captured at a minimum of two occasions with at least 4 weeks apart, and ESKD as need for dialysis and/or kidney transplantation. To ensure impartiality, the endpoint committee was not informed of the treatment assignments when assessing events. Thus, the current paper reports the protocol-defined pre-specified kidney endpoints, as they were reported by study investigators during the trial and approved by the VALUE Trial expert Endpoint Committee. However, since VALUE is the only mega-trial ever performed comparing head-to-head blocker of the renin-angiotensin system with amlodipine, explorative analyses of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will likely be reported in the future. Regarding proteinuria, this was not quantified in VALUE and thus not reported.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115vivoA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — fluid management and interdialytic weight targets emphasize that "dietary sodium should be restricted and use of a high dialysate sodium concentration and sodium profiling should be avoided"; during fluid reduction, "net fluid losses ideally should not exceed 1 to 2 kg/wk" and "weight gain between dialyses should not exceed 1 kg during the week and 1.5 to 2 kg during the weekend". During dry weight probing, "in 90% of patients, ECF volume becomes normal within a few weeks, but the elevated blood pressure continues to decrease for another 8 months or longer", reflecting a "lag phenomenon", and the figure notes "The secondary decrease in blood pressure seen at 5 months… was observed in all 8 patients studied". As patients lose excess fluid and their hypertension improves, "therapy with antihypertensive medications can be systematically tapered or discontinued".

### Low dialysate sodium and 48-h ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension: a randomized crossover study [^11678fzp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study confirms previous observations on significant reductions with low dialysate sodium of both post-dialysis and intradialytic SBP. These effects were recorded with a dialysate sodium level of 137 mEq/L (i.e. slightly higher than the average low dialysate levels of previous studies, ranging between dialysate sodium of 135 to 136.4). The intervention was well tolerated and safe, as indicated by the infrequent hypotensive episodes noted. SBP rise was not fully eliminated, but substantially attenuated with low dialysate sodium and a difference in mean intradialytic SBP of about 6 mmHg between the two interventions was observed; this effect was numerically lower than that in the study of Inrig et al. probably due to the greater differences in dialysate sodium concentrations compared therein. Patients randomized to receive low-then-standard dialysate sodium (Group A) had greater BP drops with low sodium compared with patients who received standard-then-low dialysate sodium. This is consistent with the observations from Inrig et al. suggesting the presence of carry-over effect in both studies. In our case, this could be, at least partially, attributed to the use of the standard dialysate sodium during the washout period, which led to longer exposure of all participants to this concentration (higher than the baseline serum sodium levels in most participants) during the study.

### Factors which may influence cardiovascular disease in dialysis and transplant patients – blood pressure (chapter 10) [^114swSNn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Many renal units still fail to return blood pressure data to the Renal Registry. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the percentage of HD patients achieving the combined blood pressure standard (< 140/90 pre-dialysis) averages 43% (inter unit range 16–60%) and post-dialysis (< 130/80) average 48% (range 22–66%). On average 27% (range 12–48%) of PD patients achieve the standard of < 130/80 and 26% of renal transplant patients (range 16–40%). Over the last 8 years there has been no significant change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure achievement. Better comorbidity data returns are required by the Registry to perform blood pressure survival analyses.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^116jRbyD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy — volume and blood pressure control, treatment time and ultrafiltration rate. We recommend that patients with low residual kidney function (< 2 mL/min) undergoing thrice weekly hemodialysis be prescribed a bare minimum of 3 hours per session (1D). Consider additional hemodialysis sessions or longer treatment times for patients with large weight gains, high ultrafiltration rates, poorly controlled blood pressure, difficulty achieving dry weight, or poor metabolic control such as hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and/or hyperkalemia (Not Graded). We recommend both reducing dietary sodium intake as well as adequate sodium/water removal with hemodialysis to manage hypertension, hypervolemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy (1B). Prescribe an ultrafiltration rate for each session that balances euvolemia, blood pressure control, and solute clearance while minimizing hemodynamic instability and intradialytic symptoms (Not Graded).

### Β-blocker use in long-term dialysis patients… [^117BCetY]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions In dialysis patients without a previous documented history of HF, β-blocker use was associated with a lower risk of new HF, cardiovascular death, and death from any cause. No such associations were seen for dialysis patients with a previous history of HF. These results are hypothesis generating only and should be confirmed in randomized trials. Logistic regression analysis of factors independently associated with medications for the development of a propensity score revealed that the following factors were independently associated with use of β-blockers: previous CHD, peritoneal dialysis, higher systolic BP, aspirin use, and lower use in patients with diabetes mellitus. Other factors significantly associated with de novo HF in adjusted analysis were older age, diabetes mellitus, hemodialysis, and lower serum albumin levels.

The decreased risk of HF associated with β-blocker use was proportional over time, although by visual inspection there was some disparity in unadjusted risk of HF in the first year by β-blocker use, after which the risk of HF was similar. Figure 2 shows the results of Cox regression analysis limited to specific subgroups. β-Blocker use was independently associated with a lower risk of de novo HF, a composite outcome of HF and cardiovascular death, and all-cause death, even in models limited to patients taking β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers. β-Blocker use retained its statistical significance even in adjusted models limited to patients with or without diabetes mellitus, CHD, or hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis, although the number of diabetic patients in whom noncardioselective β-blockers were used was insufficient to calculate hazard ratios.

In the present study, in long-term dialysis patients without a known previous history of HF, use of β-blockers was independently associated with a lower subsequent risk of de novo HF, combined HF and cardiac death, and all-cause death. β-Blockers were used by only 20% of patients in this cohort regardless of the presence of previous HF. Cardioselective β-blockers are also less prone to peripheral vasoconstriction7 and, perhaps most important, have a lower risk of hyperkalemia than noncardioselective β-blockers, 7, 24 which may partly explain why they were used more frequently than noncardioselective β-blockers.

### Association of impaired diurnal blood pressure variation with a subsequent decline in glomerular filtration rate… [^115RSseo]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

The creatinine levels increased by more than 50% in 2 dippers and in 32 nondippers. These findings persisted after adjustment for other predictors of GFR decline. Conclusion Blunted diurnal blood pressure variation is associated with a subsequent deterioration in renal function that is independent of SBP load and other risk factors for renal impairment. In most individuals, there is a physiologic decline in nocturnal systolic BP of at least 10% from daytime values. 1 Patients lacking a nocturnal decline in BP have been termed nondippers, while those with normal diurnal BP variation are termed dippers. 2 Nondipping has been associated with chronic kidney disease, 3–5 hypertension in older persons, 6, 7 obstructive sleep apnea, 8 and metabolic derangements such as Cushing syndrome, 9 types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, 10–13 and insulin resistance14 independent of mean 24-hour SBP.

Although the correlation of nondipping with existing CKD has been previously reported, 3–5, 17–19 we present the first longitudinal data showing that nondipping is associated with a subsequent decline in renal function independent of baseline renal function, mean 24-hour SBP, and other risk factors for renal impairment. In our patient sample, the dippers had a mean GFR change of 1. 3% from baseline, suggesting no overall change in their renal function, because it is unlikely that GFRs actually increased. In contrast, the nondippers exhibited a mean GFR change of –15. 9%. This finding persisted after rigorous adjustment for confounding variables using a propensity score method.

In summary, although the physiologic mechanism for our findings remains incompletely understood, it is clear that nondipping is a risk factor for deterioration of renal function, independent of mean 24-hour SBPs per se. This relationship appears to be independent of DM, baseline CKD, and antihypertensive treatments. We suggest that this relationship may be mediated through increased renal and systemic SNS activity and perhaps via insulin resistance. Further elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for impaired diurnal BP variation among patients with and without renal disease may clarify the pathogenesis of CKD in the general population and the associated cardiovascular morbidity.
