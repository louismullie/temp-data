## Question

42 year old female with a BMI of 24 kg sees you for six week history of poly poly 10 pound weight loss. He has a history of diabetes diagnosed one years ago and her blood level has been well control with diet exercise and metformin during the time today fasting blood glucose level is 320 mg/dL and her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1%. Adding which of the following would be appropriate?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication should be added for a 42-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, BMI 24 kg/m², a 6-week history of polyuria, polydipsia, and 10-pound weight loss, a current fasting glucose of 320 mg/dL, and an A1c of 11.1% on metformin monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the severity of hyperglycemia and whether this constitutes metabolic decompensation. Then, I should verify guideline thresholds for initiating insulin. Next, I will consider whether to continue metformin and which insulin regimen to start. Finally, I will review alternatives if insulin is declined and outline monitoring and titration plans with safety checks for renal function and hypoglycemia risk.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity. A fasting glucose of 320 mg/dL and an A1c of 11.1% with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unintentional weight loss indicate severe hyperglycemia and likely catabolism, which meets criteria for metabolic decompensation and warrants insulin initiation rather than simply adding another oral agent [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo].

> Wait, let me verify the insulin thresholds so I don't overstate this. Multiple high-credibility guidelines advise initiating insulin when there is marked hyperglycemia, symptomatic hyperglycemia, or A1c greater than 10% and/or glucose levels at or above 300 mg/dL, particularly with catabolic features like weight loss, which fits this case precisely [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo] [^111HQmAu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping metformin. I should confirm whether metformin should be continued when insulin is started. Contemporary guidance recommends continuing background glucose-lowering agents, including metformin, when initiating insulin unless contraindicated, to leverage ongoing metabolic benefits and potentially reduce insulin requirements, so metformin should be maintained if tolerated and if renal function allows [^114osk1i] [^114o419W].

> I need to check the insulin regimen choice. For severe hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis, starting basal insulin with a reasonable initial dose and titrating to fasting glucose targets is appropriate. A practical starting point is 10 units nightly or 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, with subsequent titration every few days based on fasting glucose, while also initiating or continuing metformin and reinforcing lifestyle measures [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo].

> But wait, what if the patient declines insulin? I should consider alternatives and be transparent about their limitations. Short-course intensive insulin strategies can be used to rapidly reverse glucotoxicity and then transition back to oral therapy, and in select cases, a GLP-1 receptor agonist could be considered, but with A1c 11.1% and fasting glucose 320 mg/dL, insulin remains the evidence-based first step to restore metabolic stability before de-escalation or substitution is attempted [^113wX3WV] [^11698p33].

> I should double-check renal function before finalizing metformin continuation. Metformin is generally safe down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with dose adjustment and closer monitoring as eGFR declines below 60, so I will order labs to confirm kidney function and vitamin B12 status if metformin is continued long term [^114rR8mH] [^1162U1Qp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration. Home fasting glucose checks should guide basal insulin titration, with targets commonly set around 80–130 mg/dL, and I should plan reassessment within 1–2 weeks to adjust the dose and consider tapering insulin once fasting glucose is consistently under 100 mg/dL and symptoms resolve, while continuing metformin and arranging diabetes education and nutrition support [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Given severe symptomatic hyperglycemia with catabolic weight loss, the most appropriate next step is to add basal insulin while continuing metformin, titrating insulin to fasting glucose targets, and then reassessing the regimen once metabolic stability returns. This aligns with ADA, AACE, and Canadian guidance for this scenario [^111sf3fo] [^111HQmAu] [^11698p33].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate basal insulin** (e.g. glargine or degludec) alongside metformin, given the severe hyperglycemia (FPG 320 mg/dL, A1c 11.1%) with catabolic weight loss and symptoms. Insulin is indicated for marked hyperglycemia or A1c > 10% with catabolism, and guidelines support continuing metformin when starting insulin unless contraindicated [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo] [^114osk1i]. Start basal insulin at ~0.2 units/kg/day and titrate every few days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL; monitor for hypoglycemia and adjust metformin if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111sf3fo] [^112Sit7t]. GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors are not first-line here due to the severity of hyperglycemia and catabolism, though they may be added later once glucose control improves [^111HQmAu].

---

## Clinical assessment and rationale

- **Severity of hyperglycemia**: Fasting glucose 320 mg/dL and A1c 11.1% indicate severe, uncontrolled diabetes with likely glucotoxicity and beta-cell dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Catabolic features**: Unintentional 10-pound weight loss with polyuria and polydipsia signals metabolic decompensation and insulin deficiency [^11698p33].

- **Current therapy**: Metformin monotherapy is insufficient at this degree of hyperglycemia; insulin is indicated to rapidly restore glycemic control and reverse catabolism [^11698p33].

---

## Guideline-based recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **initiating insulin** in patients with marked hyperglycemia, catabolism, or A1c > 10% (86 mmol/mol), and to continue metformin unless contraindicated [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo] [^114osk1i]. Insulin is the most effective therapy for rapid glycemic lowering and beta-cell rest in this scenario [^11698p33].

---

## Recommended insulin regimen

Basal insulin (e.g. glargine, degludec, or NPH) is preferred initially; start at ~0.2 units/kg/day and titrate every 2–3 days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL, with close monitoring for hypoglycemia [^114ngiEQ]. Continue metformin to enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin requirements unless contraindicated by eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or intolerance [^112Sit7t] [^114osk1i].

---

## Alternative pharmacologic options

GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors are **not first-line** here due to the severity of hyperglycemia and catabolism, but may be considered after initial insulin stabilization to aid weight and cardiometabolic risk reduction [^11698p33] [^1158avd1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Home glucose monitoring**: Check fasting and premeal glucose frequently during titration.

- **Hypoglycemia education**: Teach recognition and treatment of low glucose.

- **Renal function**: Monitor eGFR and adjust metformin if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112Sit7t].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess within 1–2 weeks to titrate insulin and evaluate for add-on therapy once glucose improves [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Initiate **basal insulin** alongside continued metformin to rapidly control hyperglycemia, halt catabolic weight loss, and preserve beta-cell function; titrate insulin to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL and monitor closely for hypoglycemia and renal function [^11698p33] [^111sf3fo] [^114osk1i].

### Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet as an alternative treatment for type 2 diabetes in a normal weight woman: a 14-month case study [^1131U2RT]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This case demonstrates the effective and sustainable use of intermittent fasting (IF) and ketogenic diet (KD) in a normal weight patient with type 2 diabetes, who did not attain glycaemic control with a standard care approach. A 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and strict adherence to a standard diabetic diet presented with a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.3%. Within 4 months of transitioning to KD, combined with IF, she achieved glycaemic control off pharmacotherapy, with HbA1c of 6.4. IF regimens started as 24 hours three times per week, followed by 42 hours three times per week, then 42 hours two times per week and 16 hours once per week. A maintenance phase was then begun at 8 months; IF was reduced to 16 hours per day, with 24 hours three times per month, and metformin was restarted. At 14 months, HbA1c reached 5.8%, and body mass index was minimally changed.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old woman with a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes had been managed for the majority of her illness with metformin and a standard diabetic diet. She had a remote history of gestational diabetes at age 20 and 34 years. At the time of her diagnosis with type 2 diabetes mellitus at age 42 years, her HbA1c was 7.1% and body mass index (BMI) was 21.9 kg/m 2, classified as normal weight. During the course of her illness, she had strictly adhered to a diet prescribed to her by a registered dietician and based on prior American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. It had consisted of carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and low-fat dairy, as well as poultry, fish and nuts. She had strictly limited her intake of saturated fat, red meats, sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and sodium. She had regularly eaten three meals per day with two snacks.

In June 2016, at age 54 years, her HbA1c had risen to 8.7% and BMI to 23.2 kg/m², while on metformin and her diabetic diet; glipizide was then added to her regimen. By February 2017, her HbA1c had only marginally improved to 8.3%, but she experienced weight gain with a rise in her BMI to 24%, a common side effect of sulfonylurea drugs. Pioglitazone was subsequently added to her regimen of metformin and glipizide, but she reported not taking it consistently due to episodes of hypoglycaemia and dizziness. In June 2017, her HbA1c was 7.8%, and she was told to lower her dose of glipizide, continue metformin and to resume pioglitazone. In October 2017, her HbA1c had improved to 6.5%; however, she reported frequent hypoglycaemia, dizziness and feeling unwell, and she discontinued her pioglitazone and glipizide on her own. In July 2018, her HbA1c had risen to 9.3% on a regimen of metformin and her diabetic diet.

Case presentation

A 22-year-old woman was incidentally found to have hyperglycemia during a routine medical examination, despite the absence of polydipsia or polyuria. She was diagnosed with T2DM based on a fasting blood glucose level of 9.8mmol/L, glycated hemoglobulin (HbA 1C) of 9.5%, a positive family history of diabetes in second-degree relatives, negative islet antibodies, and obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.1 kg/m 2 (height 165 cm, weight 87.5 kg). She was initially prescribed metformin (1000 mg twice daily) and advised to adopt intensive lifestyle modifications, including dietary energy restriction and regular exercise. Two months later, she discontinued metformin upon discovering she was five weeks pregnant. At seven weeks of pregnancy, she presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of hyperemesis, generalized weakness, progressive polydipsia, and a urine output of 2–3 L/day. HHS was diagnosed based on the following findings: blood glucose of 75.9 mmol/L, HbA 1C of 11.58%, corrected serum sodium of 166.96 mmol/L, negative urinary ketones, serum creatinine of 300.53µmol/L, uric acid of 1183.13µmol/L and arterial blood gas showing PH 7.34, bicarbonate 20.4mmol/L, base excess − 3.5mmol/L, lactic acid 3.93mmol/L. Additional laboratory data are summarized in Table 1. Within two hours of admission, she developed mental confusion and subsequently fell into a coma. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and managed according to the HHS protocol. Her consciousness was restored within 24 h following successful fluid resuscitation and continuous intravenous insulin therapy. During her hospitalization, she complained of abdominal pain, and severe acute pancreatitis was confirmed by elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, as well as a CT of pancreas. On the second day of admission, she experienced a spontaneous abortion. Her treatment included intravenous norepinephrine for shock, continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury, enteral nutrition support, octreotide, antibiotic, and triglyceride-lowering drugs (triglyceride level: 10.95 mmol/L), and anticoagulation. By day 10 of admission, Her HHS and pancreatitis had significantly improved; however, hypernatremia unexpectedly recurred and persisted despite intravenous fluid replacement (Table 1). Fluid balance was closely monitored and maintained with timely supplementation. Her urine output increased to 10 L/day, accompanied with a decline in urine specific gravity, which was initially attributed to the polyuria phase of acute kidney injury. She was discharged without any specific intervention and continued enteral nutrition support with 2000 kcal/day of intacted protein enteral nutrition powder for three weeks. Basal insulin (14 units daily) was irregularly administered for glycemic control.

### A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of twice-daily saxagliptin plus metformin combination therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy [^112ovyhX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a randomized (1:1), multicenter, parallel-group trial (outpatient setting) comparing saxagliptin 2.5 mg BID versus placebo BID as add-on therapy to metformin IR BID (ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT00885378. The study took place at 25 sites in the United States, 9 sites in Germany, 5 sites in Hungary, and 4 sites in Puerto Rico. The protocol, amendments, and patient informed consent were approved by the institutional review board(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) at each site before study initiation, and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice. Patients provided informed consent before study participation. Each IRB/IEC was composed of a review panel that was responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in the clinical investigation and was adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.

Eligibility

Patients were men and nonpregnant nonlactating women aged 18 to 78 years receiving stable metformin IR monotherapy (daily dose ≥ 1500 mg, given BID) for ≥ 8 weeks before enrollment and having inadequate glycemic control (HbA 1c level 7.0%–10.0% with diet and exercise). Additional inclusion criteria were a fasting C-peptide value ≥ 0.8 ng/mL and body mass index (BMI) ≤ 45.0 kg/m 2. Patients were excluded if they had marked polydipsia and polyuria with > 10% weight loss < 3 months before screening, history of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or insulin therapy (except during short-term hospitalization or gestational diabetes) within 1 year of screening. Additional exclusion criteria included a cardiovascular event within 3 months of screening, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class III/IV, known ejection fraction ≤ 40%, or history of hemoglobinopathies.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112svsDJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

### Intense simplified strategy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in patients with severe hyperglycaemia: multicentre, open label, randomised trial [^113wX3WV]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Baseline characteristics and SIIT

A total of 464 patients were screened between December 2017 and December 2020, of which 412 were eligible and were subsequently randomised and treated with SIIT. Thirty nine participants who did not return for any follow-up after SIIT were excluded from further efficacy analysis. Among the remaining 373 patients (full analysis set), 321 completed the 48 week follow-up (per protocol set), with 12 from the linagliptin plus metformin group, 13 from the linagliptin group, 10 from the metformin group, and 17 from the control group dropping out during follow-up (fig 1).

Fig 1
Trial profile

The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the four groups (intention-to-treat population, n = 412; table 1). The participants had an average age of 46.8 (standard deviation (SD) 11.2) years, a mean body mass index of 25.8 (2.9), and an estimated duration of diabetes of 1.0 (interquartile range 0.5–5.0) months. Among the randomised participants, 75% (311/412) had a disease duration of less than six months and 25% (101/412) had a duration of six months or more (up to three years), including 16% (64/412) with a duration of more than one year. All participants had significantly elevated HbA 1c (11.0% (SD 1.9%)), fasting plasma glucose (11.4 (2.9) mmol/L), and two hour postprandial glucose (20.5 (4.0) mmol/L) concentrations, with 76% (312/412) of the participants showing symptoms of hyperglycaemia (that is, polyuria, polydipsia, or unexpected weight loss). The initial insulin dose was 37.6 (SD 25.4) IU/day (0.50 (0.35) IU/kg/day). During SIIT, near-normoglycaemia was achieved in 3.8 (SD 2.3) days, with a mean maximum daily insulin dose of 53.4 (18.7) IU/day (0.74 (0.22) IU/kg/day). Afterwards, the insulin dose gradually decreased to 32.0 (SD 15.0) IU/day (0.45 (0.21) IU/kg/day) at the end of SIIT, with no significant differences among the treatment groups. As anticipated, in the overall cohort, fasting glucose decreased from 11.4 (SD 2.9) mmol/L to 5.9 (1.1) mmol/L, two hour postprandial glucose decreased from 20.5 (4.0) mmol/L to 13.8 (3.0) mmol/L, and HbA 1c decreased from 11.0% (1.9%) to 9.2% (1.3%) after SIIT (all P < 0.001). We observed improvements in lipid profiles and recovery in both β cell function and insulin sensitivity, with no significant differences among the groups.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose [^116Di56J]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose form an intermediate stage in the natural history of diabetes mellitus. From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have one of these conditions. Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg per dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and impaired fasting glucose is defined as glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg per dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol per L) in fasting patients. These glucose levels are above normal but below the level that is diagnostic for diabetes. Patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose have a significant risk of developing diabetes and thus are an important target group for primary prevention. Risk factors for diabetes include family history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of gestational diabetes or large-for-gestational-age infant, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Blacks, Latin Americans, Native Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders also are at increased risk for diabetes. Patients at higher risk should be screened with a fasting plasma glucose level. When the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is made, physicians should counsel patients to lose 5 to 7 percent of their body weight and engage in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. Drug therapy with metformin or acarbose has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. However, medications are not as effective as lifestyle changes, and it is not known if treatment with these drugs is cost effective in the management of impaired glucose tolerance.

Lifestyle interventions were effective in all subgroups, while subgroup analyses suggest that metformin was effective in persons younger than 60 years, in persons with a BMI of 35 or greater, in persons with a fasting plasma glucose level of 110 mg/dL (6.11 mmol/L) or greater, or in persons with a history of gestational diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have a beneficial effect on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels, whereas metformin has a beneficial effect on weight but does not appear to affect blood pressure or to consistently improve lipid levels.

Diabetes prevention evidence — magnitude and durability of lifestyle-induced weight loss: Convincing evidence from well-conducted randomized controlled trials indicates that weight reduction of ≥ 5% of initial body weight in overweight individuals at metabolic risk is effective in decreasing the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors; diabetes prevention trials typically targeted a negative energy balance of 500 to 1000 kcal/d, producing 1 to 2 pounds/wk (0.5 to 1.1 kg/wk) weight loss. In the DPP study, mean weight loss was ~7 kg at 1 year with ~4 kg after 3 to 4 years, and in DPP participants each kilogram of weight loss was linked to a 16% reduction in diabetes risk; an NHLBI review found that average weight loss of 2.5 to 5.5 kg over ≥ 2 years reduces T2DM risk by 30% to 60%. A systematic review estimated that 5% to 10% weight loss during 12 to 24 months was associated with reductions in fasting glucose of ~0.2 mmol/L and HbA1c of ~0.6 percentage points.

General Considerations

Dosage of GLUCOVANCE must be individualized
on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum
recommended daily dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin. GLUCOVANCE
should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual
dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely
due to glyburide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and
permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of
blood glucose for the individual patient.

With initial
treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring
should be used to determine the therapeutic response to GLUCOVANCE and to
identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1cshould
be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness
of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to
decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1cto normal or as near normal
as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c(glycosylated
hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than
FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically
examining the safety and efficacy of switching to GLUCOVANCE therapy in patients
taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes
in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia
or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should
be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

GLUCOVANCE in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise

Recommended starting dose: 1.25
mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals.

For
patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily
managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of GLUCOVANCE
is 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with
baseline HbA1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg/dL,
a starting dose of GLUCOVANCE 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning
and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments
of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every 2 weeks
up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of
blood glucose. In clinical trials of GLUCOVANCE as initial therapy, there
was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day. GLUCOVANCE
5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial
therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Metformin — diabetes prevention efficacy and candidate subgroups: In the DPP, metformin was as effective as lifestyle modification in participants with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and in younger participants aged 25–44 years, and in individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) it led to an equivalent 50% reduction in diabetes risk when compared with intensive lifestyle modification. By the 15-year follow-up, higher baseline fasting glucose (≥ 110 mg/dL [≥ 6.2 mmol/L] vs. 95–109 mg/dL [5.3–5.9 mmol/L]), higher A1C (6.0–6.4% [42–46 mmol/mol] vs. < 6.0% [< 42 mmol/mol]), and a history of GDM were associated with higher risk reductions with metformin. Based on DPP findings, metformin should be recommended as an option for high-risk individuals such as younger individuals, those with history of GDM, or those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^1147ZxpV]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Incretin Mimetics and Incretin Enhancers Incretin hormones stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and decrease appetite. 11 Exenatide lowers blood glucose levels and stimulates weight loss, perhaps by slowing gastric emptying and producing satiety. 11, 22 Sitagliptin has no effect on body weight. 23 There are no data on the effects of these medications on cardiovascular events.
17. Amylin Analogues Pramlintide is an amylin analogue indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes; it is rarely used to manage type 2 diabetes. 11 When pramlintide is initiated, the insulin dosage should be reduced by 50 percent to avoid potentially severe hypoglycemia. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the effects of pramlintide on cardiovascular disease.
17. 14,
24. 7, 14, 24 The goal is to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without risking significant hypoglycemia.

The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7 percent. 7 Glycemic control requires the patient to have cognitive, visual, and motor skills to monitor and manage blood glucose levels, and identifying and minimizing barriers for effective self-management is an important first step to setting individualized goals. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the frequency of home blood glucose monitoring except for patients administering multiple daily injections of insulin; several studies have questioned the usefulness of home monitoring. 25, 26 In patients with relatively well-controlled diabetes, home monitoring has not been associated with clinically significant improvements in A1C levels. 25, 26 Monitoring can be a useful tool in adjusting medications in the three-month intervals between A1C measurement, but it is also expensive and time-consuming, and it should be individualized to meet the needs of each patient.

INITIAL MANAGEMENT The first step in managing type 2 diabetes is to normalize fasting glucose levels, with weekly or monthly adjustments in the regimen. 14 Metformin is a first-line consideration. Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with its use can be minimized by beginning with a low dose and titrating slowly. Additional agents include sulfonylureas, nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Any of these agents can be combined with another. Once fasting blood glucose approaches near-normal levels, postprandial glucose is addressed by increasing the dose of the current medications or by adding additional agents. Once maximal benefit is achieved from first-line medications, other agents, such as exenatide and sitagliptin, can be considered.

INITIATING INSULIN THERAPY Less than 40 percent of patients with diabetes successfully achieve an A1C level of less than 7 percent. 24 One reason for this is the reluctance of patients and physicians to start insulin therapy, perceiving it as a treatment failure. However, progressive failure of the beta cells often occurs even with proper diet, exercise, and oral medications, so patients should be counseled that insulin is simply another management tool. Although insulin is typically introduced when glucose control is no longer possible with oral agents, it can also be used when contraindications to oral medications exist. Newly diagnosed patients also can benefit from acute insulin use. Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause glucose toxicity, a potentially reversible impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This can be corrected with aggressive insulin therapy, then oral medications can be added as insulin is tapered or discontinued.

14.2 Glycemic Control Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 Years and Older with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pediatric trial (NCT03170518), 171 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1C ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 11.0%) were randomized to INVOKANA (84 patients) or placebo (87 patients) as add-on to diet and exercise, metformin HCl (≥ 1,000 mg per day or maximally tolerated dosage), insulin, or a combination of metformin HCl and insulin, for a total of 52-weeks. At Week 13, patients in the INVOKANA arm whose HbA1Cwas ≥ 7.0% and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2were re-randomized to either continue on INVOKANA 100 mg orally once daily (n = 16) or to up-titrate to INVOKANA 300 mg orally once daily (n = 17).

At baseline, background therapies included diet and exercise only (14%), insulin monotherapy (11%), metformin HCl and insulin (29%), and metformin HCl monotherapy (46%). The mean HbA1Cat baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2 years. The mean eGFR at baseline was 157.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, and approximately 16% (24/151) of the trial population with measurements had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2were not enrolled in the trial; no patients in the trial reached an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean age was 14.3 years, 47% were under 15 years of age, and 68% were female. Approximately 42% were Asian, 42% were White, 11% were Black or African American, 5% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 36% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 30.8 kg/m2(range 18–57 kg/m2) and the mean BMI Z-score was 1.84.

At Week 26, treatment with canagliflozin provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1Cfrom baseline, compared with placebo (see Table 20).

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

### A novel genetic mutation in a Portuguese family with GCK-MODY [^116e7NTk]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous form of diabetes mellitus, with autosomal dominant inheritance. It accounts for 2%-5% of all diabetes cases. Glucokinase-MODY is the second most frequent form, which has been shown to be the result of mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene. It mostly presents with mild hyperglycemia, and, usually, no diabetes-related complications occur.

Case Report

A 9-year-old female was admitted to the Endocrine Clinic to study her fasting hyperglycemia. Despite her obesity (body mass index 28 kg/m2), her physical examination had no other abnormalities. Blood tests showed a 6.3% hemoglobin A1c, with normal standard oral glucose tolerance test result, normal insulin value and normal C-peptide level. Insulin autoantibodies and antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase were negative. She began metformin and adequate diet. She had a strongly positive family history for diabetes. The patient's mother, uncle, grandfather, great-aunt and great-grandfather on her mother's side were diagnosed with diabetes. Complete sequencing of the GCK gene, carried out in the patient, identified a novel mutation c.1268T > A (p. Phe423Tyr) in exon 10 of the gene GCK in heterozygosity. Further studies revealed the same mutation in her mother and maternal grandfather.

Conclusion

Finding the same mutation in three different generations of diabetic patients, in the same family, is highly suggestive of its pathogenicity. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time it is described in the literature. Correct molecular diagnosis of MODY predicts better the clinical course of diabetes and facilitates individualised management.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD.
- A dosage of 75 to 162 mg per day of aspirin is an option in persons with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10%. From the AFP Editors. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in persons with diabetes mellitus. In 1999 and again in 2007, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association joined together to release statements on preventing CVD in persons with diabetes. New data have emerged since the publication of these statements; therefore, an updated guideline has been released. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes. Recommendations OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Persons who are overweight or obese should reduce their energy intake, and should receive counseling that certain changes in lifestyle can result in a maintainable weight loss, which has a variety of health benefits. If weight loss cannot be achieved with these changes alone, pharmacologic therapy and surgery, which have been shown to typically result in more weight loss compared with lifestyle changes or placebo, may also be options. Pharmacologic Therapy. Medications to assist with weight loss are appropriate for persons with a body mass index of 25 to 30 kg per m 2 and comorbidities, or persons with a body mass index greater than 30 kg per m 2, regardless of the presence of comorbidities. Surgery.

Persons with a body mass index of at least 40 kg per m 2, or at least 35 kg per m 2 with a related comorbidity, who are not able to lose weight via behavioral or pharmacologic therapy may benefit from bariatric surgery. It is the most effective option for significant and maintainable weight loss in persons with severe obesity. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons. Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.

To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects. BLOOD PRESSURE Recent randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive blood pressure lowering to less than 130 mm Hg have determined that there is no benefit in reducing the risk of coronary events.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.

Section 1 — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) — Diagnosis can be made by any of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥ 8 h or overnight fast), plasma glucose (PG) concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load following an overnight fast, a random PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or hemoglobin A1c (A1c) level ≥ 6.5%. Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

### A case of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) in a family with a novel HNF1A gene mutation in five generations [^115VsQEa]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Case Description

A 50-year-old woman with DM has been regularly visiting our department and her condition closely monitored. During the initial examination in September 2015, she complained of a burning sensation in the legs during the day, periodic headaches, and fatigue.

At the age of 12 years, symptoms of dry mouth and weakness appeared following the consumption of large amounts of carbohydrate-containing foods. These complaints lasted for approximately 2 months. During a routine medical check-up, the girl received a diagnosis of fasting (7 mmol/L) and postprandial hyperglycemia (11 mmol/L) and glycosuria; she did not have excess body weight, and there was no ketosis or ketoacidosis. Her weight and height corresponded to her age, and there were no signs of insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans. Concomitant pathology and cardiovascular diseases were absent. Autoimmune processes were not detected, and antibodies to B cells were absent. As recommended by the physicians, she went on a diet restricting the intake of easily digestible carbohydrates. The patient was advised to participate in physical activities on a regular basis. Until 1987, she was normoglycemic on this adjusted lifestyle. In 1987, at age 21 years, she became pregnant for the first time, and in week 22 of the pregnancy, a diagnosis of gestational DM was made. Insulin therapy as the basal-bolus regimen was initiated. In 1988, stimulated delivery (36 weeks) resulted in a birth of a boy weighing 4000 g. After the delivery, the insulin therapy was discontinued, and the patient remained on a strict diet. From 1988 to 1994, she was normoglycemic following this regimen of a strict diet and a regular physical activity. In 1994, at the age of 28 years, stress-associated carbohydrate metabolism decompensation developed, with fasting glycemia (10 mmol/L), postprandial glycemia (16 mmol/L), glycosuria, ketonuria, and a weight loss of 7 kg. Insulin therapy as the basal-bolus regimen was resumed and is currently maintained. The patient uses insulin Degludec at the dose of 10 U/day and insulin aspart at 1 U per carbohydrate unit (CU) (averaging 18–20 U/day). From 1994 to 2002, fasting glycemia was in the range of 6–8 mmol/L, and postprandial glycemia ranged from 6 to 10 mmol/L. In 2002, she was diagnosed as non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with peripheral polyneuropathy. She had no other diabetic complications or comorbidities. Since 2012, the patient has not been examined by an ophthalmologist; therefore, the stage of retinopathy at this time is not known. Testing for pancreas islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies yielded negative results. The C-peptide level was 338 pmol/L (reference range 298–2350), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.7%. Blood biochemical analysis identified a moderate increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.4 mmol/L (reference values are < 2.6 mmol/L). The body–mass index (BMI) is 24.5 kg/m 2.

### Diagnosis and management of prediabetes: a review [^113C6Tks]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prediabetes, an intermediate stage between normal glucose regulation and diabetes, affects 1 in 3 adults in the US and approximately 720 million individuals worldwide.

Observations

Prediabetes is defined by a fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL, a glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL measured 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, or glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1C) of 5.7% to 6.4% or 6.0% to 6.4%. In the US, approximately 10% of people with prediabetes progress to having diabetes each year. A meta-analysis found that prediabetes at baseline was associated with increased mortality and increased cardiovascular event rates (excess absolute risk, 7.36 per 10 000 person-years for mortality and 8.75 per 10 000 person-years for cardiovascular disease during 6.6 years). Intensive lifestyle modification, consisting of calorie restriction, increased physical activity (≥ 150 min/wk), self-monitoring, and motivational support, decreased the incidence of diabetes by 6.2 cases per 100 person-years during a 3-year period. Metformin decreased the risk of diabetes among individuals with prediabetes by 3.2 cases per 100 person-years during 3 years. Metformin is most effective for women with prior gestational diabetes and for individuals younger than 60 years with body mass index of 35 or greater, fasting plasma glucose level of 110 mg/dL or higher, or HbA1c level of 6.0% or higher.

Conclusions and Relevance

Prediabetes is associated with increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular events, and mortality. First-line therapy for prediabetes is lifestyle modification that includes weight loss and exercise or metformin. Lifestyle modification is associated with a larger benefit than metformin.

Initial insulin titration protocol — suspected type 2 diabetes (T2D) directs early testing and stepwise therapy as follows: Order pancreatic autoantibodies at diagnosis and if + add MDI. Is patient already on MDI? If yes: Stop short-acting insulin; ensure initial long-acting dose is optimized (0.5 units/kg); and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily, and check BG 2x daily (fasting, post-prandial). If no: Is HbA1c ≥ 8.5% OR ketosis present; if yes: Start long-acting (LA) insulin (0.5 units/kg) and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily; if no: Start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily over 4 weeks. Use post-prandial glucoses to guide changes in eating, adding medications, etc. Reassess: Is patient on maximally tolerated dose metformin? If yes: Increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl; if no: Continue to increase metformin and increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 200 mg/dl. If difficulty tolerating metformin, try extended release or consider switching to pioglitazone 30 mg daily.

### Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting for people with type 2 diabetes as an alternative to insulin [^113cLs94]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The goals in caring for patients with T2D are to reduce symptoms and to prevent or slow the development of complications. The main interventions for treating T2D have been lifestyle modification, pharmacological and in some cases surgical. The use of a therapeutic fasting regimen for treatment of T2D is virtually unheard of. This present case series showed that 24-hour fasting regimens can significantly reverse or eliminate the need for diabetic medication.

A case review by Unwin and Tobindocumented that they were able to 'deprescribe' a 52-year-old man who was living with T2D for 14 years. He was suffering from gastrointestinal side effects from his metformin medication. Following a low-carbohydrate diet, the patient steadily lost a total of 16 kg over 7 months and successfully stopped all prescribed drugs, thereby achieving his goal of being medication-free.

Caloric restriction and weight loss are important factors for remission of T2D, as recently demonstrated in an open-label Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT). The DiRECT study showed diabetes remission and maintenance through caloric restriction (~840 calories/day) and weight loss in a non-insulin-dependent diabetic population. To date, however, very few studies or cases have been documented or published with respect to therapeutic fasting as a cure for T2D, reversing it completely and eliminating the use of insulin. We were unable to locate a single case study published in the last 30 years.

In our study all three patients eliminated the need for insulin by initiating a therapeutic fasting regimen. All three patients succeeded within a month and one in as little as 5 days. Further, all patients improved in multiple other clinically significant health outcome measures, such as HbA1C, body mass index and waist circumference.

Canagliflozin and related SGLT-2 regimens — weight outcomes are summarized: Canagliflozin is illustrative of an SGLT-2 inhibitor that produces dose-dependent modest weight reduction (1–3%) in patients without diabetes due to glucosuria from impairment of proximal renal tubule glucose reabsorption, and licogliflozin, a dual SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor, significantly reduces body weight though the magnitude is described as modest. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, semaglutide once weekly added to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetes produced greater reductions in HbA1c (−1.42%) and body weight (−3.81 kg) versus placebo. In a randomized, controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes on stable metformin monotherapy, exenatide plus dapagliflozin produced clinically relevant changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose, 2h post-prandial glucose, and systolic blood pressure.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Remission of type 2 diabetes after treatment with a high-fiber, low-fat, plant-predominant diet intervention: a case series [^113CmwPe]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes case series — high-fiber, low-fat, plant-predominant diet intervention — evaluated adults (mostly elderly) with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% treated with a low-fat, whole food, plant-predominant diet while receiving standard medical treatment. N = 59 patients were included, with mean age 71.5 years (range 41–89), and Twenty-three (39%) patients achieved T2D remission. Mean differences post-lifestyle change (T2) versus prior (T1) showed significant decreases [least squares mean difference (95% CI)]: BMI [−2.6 (−4.8, −3.1) kg/m²; HbA1c [−1.3 (−1.6, −1.0)] %; and fasting glucose [−29.6 (−41.8, −17.5)] mg/dL. No significant differences were observed for systolic or diastolic blood pressure, HDL, LDL, or triglycerides. The page notes that "A significant reduction in body weight, especially greater than 15 kg compared to baseline, was highly predictive of remission of T2D", and concludes that a lifestyle-based treatment intervention promoting adherence to a plant-predominant diet and integrated as part of routine care can successfully achieve T2D remission in wellness clinic patients.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin monotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 102-week trial [^115hdC8y]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess initial pharmacotherapy of Type 2 diabetes with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin.

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly allocated people with Type 2 diabetes aged 18–77 years and inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise [HbA1c 53–86 mmol/mol (7.0–10.0%)] to receive placebo (n = 75) or dapagliflozin monotherapy 2.5 mg (n = 65), 5 mg (n = 64) or 10 mg (n = 70) once daily in the morning. After 24 weeks, low-dose double-blind metformin 500 mg/day was added to the placebo group regimen (placebo+low-dose metformin group). Changes in HbA1c level, fasting plasma glucose and body weight, as well as adverse events, were assessed over 102 weeks.

Results

Of the 274 participants randomized, 167 completed the study (60.9%). At 102 weeks, significant differences vs placebo+low-dose metformin with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg were observed for HbA1c (-5.8 mmol/mol [-0.53%], P = 0.018; and -4.8 mmol/mol [-0.44%], P = 0.048), respectively); and for FPG (-0.69 mmol/L, P = 0.044; and -1.12 mmol/l, P = 0.001, respectively). For body weight, the difference between the dapagliflozin 10-mg group and the placebo+low-dose metformin group was significant (-2.60 kg; P = 0.016). Hypoglycaemic events were uncommon, with rates of 5.3% for placebo+low-dose metformin group and 0–4.6% for the dapagliflozin groups. Genital infections and urinary tract infections were more common in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo+low-dose metformin group.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in treatment-naïve people with early Type 2 diabetes improved glycaemic control and reduced weight without increasing hypoglycaemia over 102 weeks. Dapagliflozin may provide an alternative initial pharmacotherapy in such people.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^117SpZm5]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

Prediabetes — pharmacologic prevention and evidence quality: We recommend that clinicians continue monitoring the most up-to-date research for evidence-based changes in practice management related to prediabetes. The evidence informing this area is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, with sample sizes low and follow-up varying from 6.0 months to 3.5 years. In patients who are poor candidates for metformin, the benefits of using an alternative medication to prevent progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus slightly outweighed the potential harm of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. Accordingly, in adults with prediabetes who have participated in healthy lifestyle modification and remain at high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest evaluating patient characteristics (e.g., age, life expectancy, co-occurring conditions, BMI, other risk factors) and offering metformin or other select medications to reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.

"Initial treatment should also be with insulin when the distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is unclear and in individuals who have random blood glucose concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL (≥ 13.9 mmol/L) and/or A1C ≥ 8.5% (≥ 69 mmol/mol)".

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Estimates from national studies and surveillance registries in the USA estimate the prevalence of diabetes among adults age 18 and older is 13%, of which 21.4% are undiagnosed. For most patients, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care state that 'An A1C goal for many non-pregnant adults of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate', although less stringent targets may be appropriate for some patients. Half of patients with T2DM have suboptimal glycemic control. Optimal glycemic control reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, obesity, and other microvascular complications.

Unless contraindicated, the ADA recommends metformin monotherapy (MM) as the first-line pharmacologic agent for T2DM treatment. Clinicians may consider second-line therapies on the basis of efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight change, side effects, and cost. If MM treatment does not result in glycemic control at a maximal tolerated dose over 3–6 months, individuals may receive either treatment intensification on top of metformin or switch to another antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) if metformin is not tolerated.

### Dapagliflozin add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 102-week trial [^1118ZRGr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Management of type 2 diabetes with metformin often does not provide adequate glycemic control, thereby necessitating add-on treatment. In a 24-week clinical trial, dapagliflozin, an investigational sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, improved glycemic control in patients inadequately controlled with metformin. The present study is an extension that was undertaken to evaluate dapagliflozin as long-term therapy in this population.

Methods

This was a long-term extension (total 102 weeks) of a 24-week phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to blinded daily treatment (placebo, or dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, or 10 mg) plus open-label metformin (≥ 1,500 mg). The previously published primary endpoint was change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 weeks. This paper reports the follow-up to week 102, with analysis of covariance model performed at 24 weeks with last observation carried forward; a repeated measures analysis was utilized to evaluate changes from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and weight.

Results

A total of 546 patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatments. The completion rate for the 78-week double-blind extension period was lower for the placebo group (63.5%) than for the dapagliflozin groups (68.3% to 79.8%). At week 102, mean changes from baseline HbA1c (8.06%) were +0.02% for placebo compared with -0.48% (P = 0.0008), -0.58% (P < 0.0001), and -0.78% (P < 0.0001) for dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, and 10 mg, respectively. In addition, all dapagliflozin groups had sustained reductions from baseline in FPG (-1.07 to -1.47 mmol/l) and body weight (-1.10 to -1.74 kg) at 102 weeks, whereas increases were noted in placebo-treated patients for both of these outcomes. Events of hypoglycemia were rare and were not severe. Evidence suggestive of genital infection was reported in 11.7% to 14.6% of dapagliflozin patients and 5.1% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 5 mg). Evidence suggestive of urinary tract infection was reported in 8.0% to 13.3% of dapagliflozin patients and 8.0% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin added to metformin for 102 weeks enabled sustained reductions in HbA1c, FPG, and weight without increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

### Why insulin sensitizers but not secretagogues should be retained when initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes [^1126thGv]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The stringent targets set for HbA(1c) levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycaemia in the early stages of disease results in progressive loss of beta-cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti-diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s). Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti-diabetic drug therapy; however, their long-term efficacy in patients with depleted beta-cell capacity is doubtful, and other classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycaemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of beta-cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy. This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

This was a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, active‐controlled, non‐inferiority study evaluating the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin versus sitagliptin administered for 24 weeks as add‐on therapy to metformin plus glimepiride in patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control. It was conducted at 25 institutions in Korea from April 2015 to July 2017.

Prior to initiation, the study was approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and by the Institutional Review Board at each participating centre. It was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines from the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, Korean GCP guidelines, and other applicable local regulations. All study subjects provided informed consent prior to inclusion. The trial was registered at(NCT02567994).

2.2 Eligibility

The study included male and female subjects with T2DM aged ≥ 19 years at screening. All had HbA1c levels of 7.0% to 11.0%, a body mass index (BMI) of 20.0 to 40.0 kg/m 2, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 270 mg/dL. Eligible subjects had been treated with metformin (≥ 1000 mg/d) and glimepiride (≥ 4 mg/d) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, and were undergoing diet and exercise therapy.

Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: a history of type 1 or secondary diabetes mellitus; treatment with a DPP‐4 inhibitor or GLP‐1 analogue within 6 months prior to screening, or insulin treatment within 12 weeks prior to screening; taking body weight‐loss drugs or having unstable body weight (change ≥ 5% in the past 6 months); poor nutritional status, weak condition or excessive alcohol intake (> 21 units/week), as judged by the investigator; cardiac failure (New York Heart Association Class III‐IV), congestive failure or arrhythmia requiring treatment; a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or coronary artery bypass surgery within 6 months prior to screening; diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg and/or systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg; fasting triglyceride levels > 600 mg/dL; a history of malignant tumour within the past 5 years; significant liver or renal disease; or ongoing treatment for hyperthyroidism or an abnormal thyroid‐stimulating hormone level.

Patients and Methods

Patients

A total of 15 patients (12 men, three women) with T2DM participated in the study. Patient characteristics were as follows (values reported as mean ± standard error of the mean): age, 55 ± 2 years; body mass index, 31.1 ± 2.1 kg/m 2; diabetes duration, 8.2 ± 1.6 years; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value, 7.8% ± 0.2%; fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 195 ± 9 mg/dL; and estimated glomerular filtration rate, 107 ± 7 mL/min × 1.73 m 2. Other than diabetes, patients were in good general health as determined by medical history, physical examination, screening laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram. Body weight was stable (± 3 pounds) in all patients for at least 3 months before the study and no patient participated in any excessively heavy exercise program. Patients were treated with metformin (n = 11), metformin/sulfonylureas (n = 2), sulfonylurea (n = 1), and diet (n = 1). Other than these oral antidiabetic agents, patients did not take any medication known to affect glucose metabolism.

This was an open-label study in which all patients were treated with empagliflozin 25 mg/d and received a stepped hyperglycemic clamp before and at 48 hours and 14 days after the starting empagliflozin treatment.

Research design

All studies were performed at the Clinical Research Center of the Texas Diabetes Institute, San Antonio, Texas, after patients had fasted overnight. On days 5, 4, 2, and 1 before initiating empagliflozin treatment, 24-hour urine samples were collected for measurement of baseline urinary glucose excretion. On day 3 before initiating empagliflozin treatment, a baseline stepped hyperglycemic clamp was performed after a 10-hour overnight fast. Patients reported to the Clinical Research Center at 6:00and a catheter was placed into an antecubital vein. A low-dose insulin infusion (0.1 to 0.2 mU/kg × minute) was started to reduce the FPG concentration to ∼100 mg/dL. The insulin infusion then was discontinued for 20 minutes, at which time the stepped hyperglycemic clamp was performed. A second catheter was placed into a vein on the dorsum of the hand for blood withdrawal, and the hand was placed in a thermoregulated box heated to 60°C to obtain arterialized blood samples.

### Dual add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes poorly controlled with metformin monotherapy: a randomized double-blind trial of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin addition versus single addition of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin to metformin [^1174aPrh]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety of dual add-on of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin and dapagliflozin added on alone in patients with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled with metformin.

Research Design and Methods

This was a double-blind trial in adults with HbA1c ≥ 8.0% and ≤ 12.0% (64–108 mmol/mol), randomized to saxagliptin (SAXA) (5 mg/day) plus dapagliflozin (DAPA) (10 mg/day; n = 179), or SAXA (5 mg/day) and placebo (n = 176), or DAPA (10 mg/day) and placebo (n = 179) on background metformin extended release (MET) ≥ 1,500 mg/day. Primary objective compared changes from baseline in HbA1c with SAXA+DAPA+MET versus SAXA+MET and DAPA+MET.

Results

Patients had a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.9% (74 mmol/mol), diabetes duration of 7.6 years, and a BMI of 32 kg/m(2). At week 24, the adjusted mean change from the baseline HbA1c was -1.5% (-16.1 mmol/mol) with SAXA+DAPA+MET versus -0.9% (-9.6 mmol/mol) with SAXA+MET (difference -0.59% [-6.4 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001) and -1.2% (-13.1 mmol/mol) with DAPA+MET (difference -0.27% [3.0 mmol/mol], P < 0.02). The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol) was 41% with SAXA+DAPA+MET versus 18% with SAXA+MET and 22% with DAPA+MET. Urinary and genital infections occurred in ≤ 1% of patients receiving SAXA+DAPA+MET. Hypoglycemia was infrequent, with no episodes of major hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

In this first report of adding a well-tolerated combination of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin to background metformin therapy in patients poorly controlled with metformin, greater improvements in glycemic control were obtained with triple therapy by the dual addition of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin than dual therapy with the addition of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin alone.

### Prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^112V18qs]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Prediabetes is not a diagnosis but rather an opportunity to prevent or delay a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
- Intensive lifestyle programs are the most effective intervention for preventing or delaying a diagnosis of diabetes in patients with prediabetes.
- In patients with prediabetes, metformin therapy will slow the progression to type 2 diabetes, although less effectively than lifestyle programs over time.
- In patients who have had gestational diabetes, the benefits of metformin therapy are similar to those of lifestyle programs. From the AFP Editors. Screening high-risk individuals for diabetes mellitus is essential because approximately one-fourth of Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening all adults 45 years and older for diabetes every three years using A1C, fasting glucose, or two-hour glucose tolerance testing.

People younger than 45 years who are overweight or obese and are at high risk because of a family history, certain medical conditions, or physical inactivity and those who belong to a high-risk racial or ethnic group or who have signs of insulin resistance should also receive regular testing. Classifying screening test results as indicative of prediabetes shows an increased risk of a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and provides an opportunity for prevention. Criteria for prediabetes, including A1C levels of 5. 7 to
6. 4, fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg per dL, or two-hour glucose of 140 to 199 mg per dL after a 75-mg oral glucose load, identify individuals for whom diabetes prevention will be beneficial. The ADA has released updated guidelines for the prevention or delay of diabetes. Lifestyle Change Strong evidence supports lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent diabetes. Programs that include diet, weight loss, and exercise reduce type 2 diabetes diagnoses by up to 58% over three years. Over longer periods, 27% to 43% of people will avoid a diagnosis of diabetes with sustained lifestyle changes. Programs should be modeled after the National Diabetes Prevention Program, which targets sustained weight loss of at least 7% of body weight and at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly. Although weight loss is considered the most important factor for lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes, achieving the physical activity goal of at least 150 minutes per week can reduce diabetes incidence by 44% without weight loss.

Because no optimal diet has been identified to prevent the onset of diabetes, dietary counseling should be tailored to individual preferences. A Mediterranean-style or low-carbohydrate diet, and perhaps a vegetarian, plant-based, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The National Diabetes Prevention Program brings evidence-based lifestyle change programs into communities. Overweight, nonpregnant adults with prediabetes can be referred to the program by their physician, or patients may self-refer. Medications Medications can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes but are less effective than lifestyle programs. Metformin has the strongest evidence, whereas liraglutide, insulin, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate all have some evidence of benefit.
