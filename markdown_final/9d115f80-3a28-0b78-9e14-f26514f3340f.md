## Question

Problem 39. The height drawn to the base of an isosceles triangle is equal to 5 cm. The height drawn to the lateral side is 6 cm. Find the base.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the base of an isosceles triangle given that the height to the base is 5 cm and the height to a lateral side is 6 cm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and label variables. Then, I should express the area in two different ways using the two heights. Next, I will equate the two area expressions to relate the base and the lateral side. After that, I need to use the Pythagorean theorem to connect the base, lateral side, and height to the base. Finally, I will solve the resulting system of equations for the base length and verify the solution makes sense geometrically.

> Let me first confirm the setup and notation. In an isosceles triangle, let the base be b, the two equal lateral sides be a, the height to the base be h_b = 5 cm, and the height to a lateral side be h_a = 6 cm. I should double-check that these heights are indeed perpendicular to the respective bases they are drawn to, which they are by definition of triangle height [^notfound].

> Now, I will express the area in two ways. The area can be written as [1/2] × base × height to the base, so Area = [1/2] × b × 5. It can also be written as [1/2] × lateral side × height to the lateral side, so Area = [1/2] × a × 6. Wait, let me verify that both expressions truly represent the same area; yes, they do, so I can set them equal to each other to eliminate the area variable [^notfound].

> Equating the two area expressions gives [1/2] × b × 5 = [1/2] × a × 6. Simplifying, I get 5b = 6a, which implies a = [5/6]b. Hold on, I should verify the algebra; yes, that's correct, and it establishes a direct relationship between the lateral side and the base [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how the height to the base relates to the sides. The height to the base in an isosceles triangle bisects the base, forming two congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has legs of length b/2 and 5 cm, and hypotenuse a. By the Pythagorean theorem, I have (b/2)² + 5² = a². I need to ensure I'm applying the theorem correctly here; yes, this is the standard right-triangle relationship in this configuration [^notfound].

> Substituting a = [5/6]b into the Pythagorean equation yields (b/2)² + 25 = ([5/6]b)². Let me expand and simplify carefully: b²/4 + 25 = 25b²/36. Multiplying through by 36 to clear denominators gives 9b² + 900 = 25b². Rearranging, 16b² = 900, so b² = [900/16] = [225/4]. Therefore, b = [15/2] = 7.5 cm. Wait, I should double-check the arithmetic; yes, 900 divided by 16 is 56.25, and the square root of 56.25 is 7.5, so b = 7.5 cm is correct [^notfound].

> Let me verify the solution makes geometric sense. If b = 7.5 cm, then a = [5/6] × 7.5 = 6.25 cm. Checking the Pythagorean relation: (7.5/2)² + 5² = 3.75² + 25 = 14.0625 + 25 = 39.0625, and 6.25² = 39.0625, which matches. I should also confirm the area consistency: [1/2] × 7.5 × 5 = 18.75 cm², and [1/2] × 6.25 × 6 = 18.75 cm², so both area expressions agree. The solution is internally consistent and geometrically plausible [^notfound].

---

The base of the isosceles triangle is **7.5 cm**. This result comes from equating two expressions for the area: [1/2] × base × 5 cm and [1/2] × lateral side × 6 cm, and then using the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lateral side to the base and the 5 cm height. The algebra yields a base of **7.5 cm**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: define variables and given information

Let the isosceles triangle have:

- **Base**: (b) cm
- **Equal lateral sides**: (a) cm
- **Height to the base**: (h_b = 5) cm
- **Height to a lateral side**: (h_a = 6) cm

---

### Step 2: express the area in two ways

The area (A) of the triangle can be expressed using either height:

- **Using height to the base**: (A = [1/2] × b × h_b = [1/2] × b × 5)
- **Using height to a lateral side**: (A = [1/2] × a × h_a = [1/2] × a × 6)

Since both expressions represent the same area, we equate them:

[1/2] × b × 5 = [1/2] × a × 6

Simplifying gives:

5b = 6a ⇒ a = [5/6]b

---

### Step 3: apply the Pythagorean theorem

The height to the base divides the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles, each with:

- **Hypotenuse**: (a) cm
- **One leg**: (b/2) cm
- **Other leg**: (h_b = 5) cm

By the Pythagorean theorem:

a² = (b/2)² + 5²

Substitute (a = [5/6]b):

([5/6]b)² = (b/2)² + 25

[25/36]b² = [1/4]b² + 25

---

### Step 4: solve for the base (b)

Multiply through by 36 to clear denominators:

25b² = 9b² + 900

16b² = 900

b² = [900/16] = [225/4]

b = √[225/4] = [15/2] = 7.5 cm

---

### Step 5: verification

Check that the lateral side (a = [5/6]b = [5/6] × 7.5 = 6.25) cm satisfies the Pythagorean relation:

(7.5/2)² + 5² = 3.75² + 25 = 14.0625 + 25 = 39.0625

6.25² = 39.0625 ✓

---

The base of the isosceles triangle is **7.5 cm**.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^83b2db32]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Triangular and cylindrical objects

This set of experiments was first carried out in the convex-1 environment, followed by a 40 cm square environment containing two discrete objects (Extended Data Fig. 7h). The first object was an isosceles right triangle with the hypotenuse side measuring 20 cm in length and 7 cm in height (occasionally, animals climbed on top of the object). The second object was a cylinder with a diameter of 3 cm and a height of 14 cm. For this experiment, we recorded a total of eight sessions (30 min per session) from eight mice for each environment.

Shuttle box

The shuttle box consisted of two connected, 25 (L) × 25 (W) × 25 (H) cm compartments with distinct colours and visual cues (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The opening in the middle was 6.5 cm wide, so that the mouse could easily run between the two compartments during miniscope recordings. The black compartment was wrapped in black paper, but not the grey compartment. For two days, we recorded a total of 18 sessions (20 min per session) from nine mice, two sessions per mouse.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^209ec7ce]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular access is routinely performed by critical care physicians and the use of ultrasonography is recommended. However, complications during vessel puncture are not rare, particularly for residents in training with low levels of experience. Reminding about the properties of the isosceles right triangle might be of interest to teach young fellows a secure step by step technique for vessel catheterization.

An isosceles right triangle has two equal legs and has angles of 90°, 45° and 45°. For two equal legs having the length ɭ, the hypotenuse has a length corresponding to ɭ × √2. This last number, also called Pythagoras' constant, corresponds approximately to 1.4. After a longitudinal scan of the vein run, let's insert the needle in the skin, just over the vein (Fig. 1a). Let's position the probe perpendicular to the skin, just over the vein, at a length ɭ of the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vein under the probe. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe.

Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe. b The long-axis plane, which passes through the length of the vessel, corresponds to the view obtained in the in-plane technique with the vessel in the long-axis. Three points determine the long-axis plane: the needle insertion point, identified by inserting the needle in the skin just above the vessel, the vessel being viewed in the long axis; the middle of the probe on the skin, the vessel being visualized at the center of the ultrasound screen in the short axis; the middle of the probe's top, the probe being perpendicular to the skin. The operator should attempt to maintain the syringe in the axis of the probe top (dotted line)

### Ipsilateral full-thickness forearm skin graft for covering the radial forearm flap donor site [^0b1a1070]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The technique of the ipsilateral full-thickness forearm skin graft for covering the defect of radial forearm free flap (RFFF) improves aesthetic impairment at the recipient and donor sites by split-thickness skin graft repair and omits the need to make an extraoperative site for harvesting the skin graft. However, in this technique, the RFFF is limited in size. In the present study, we considered a model of the forearm and calculated the possible size of the RFFF for using this technique.

Methods

The calculation was conducted under assumptions that the isosceles-triangle skin graft is elevated as its height is twice the RFFF length in the direction of the forearm axis and that the forearm skin defect can be primarily closed with a width shorter than one-fourth of the wrist circumference. The calculation revealed that this technique is feasible when the RFFF width, that is, the length vertical to the forearm axis, is shorter than half of the wrist circumference. We repaired the RFFF defect using this technique in 15 patients with head and neck cancer in whom the RFFF size conformed to the above-mentioned condition.

Results

When the RFFF width was shorter than half of the wrist circumference and the isosceles-triangle skin graft was elevated as its height was twice the RFFF length, the RFFF defect could be repaired using this technique in all 15 patients.

Conclusion

The above-mentioned condition (that the RFFF width is shorter than half of the wrist circumference) is useful for determining whether or not the technique of ipsilateral full-thickness forearm skin graft can be used for covering the RFFF defect.

### Horizontal flip pedicled genioplasty for correction of asymmetric chin in adult unilateral temperomandibular joint ankylosis [^842b5f82]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

It has been the desire and a great challenge to clinicians treating maxillofacial deformities to bring about symmetry in asymmetric faces. As one understands, it is very difficult to reproduce nature, that is, the normal side out of abnormal side, and it is easier to manage bilateral symmetrical deformities. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, when it occurs in early childhood, will have devastating effects on the future growth and development of the jaws and teeth with obvious facial deformity including the chin, which worsens with advancing age and the time elapsed between the onset of ankylosis and the treatment instituted. We have been treating these chin deformities in adult unilateral TMJ ankylosis cases for over more than a decade with horizontal flip pedicled genioplasty, which has a mathematical basis of turning a scalene triangle to an isosceles triangle and thereby achieving symmetry. Fixation of the genial segment in an overriding position not only adds to the length of mandible but also overcomes the obstructive sleep apnea many times associated with TMJ ankylosis. We have successfully treated 15 patients using horizontal flip pedicled genioplasty during last 14 years. This instantaneous corrective and unique technique requiring minimal patient compliance is put forward with refinements developed during a period of years.

### Innovative modification of the hepatic portoenterostomy. our experience of treating biliary atresia [^d92265a1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We modified conventional hepatic portoenterostomy by pulling the remnant fibrous mass caudally and placing 5 or 6 numbered and individually clamped absorbable 5–0 double-needle sutures horizontally in the liver surface of the posterior side of the remnant fibrous mass before excision and apposing the posterior and anterior margins of the hepatic portoenterostomy to resemble a flattened isosceles triangle. Our technique was used to treat 14 cases of biliary atresia. Good postoperative biliary excretion (serum total bilirubin, < 2 mg/dL) was achieved in 13 (92.9%) of 14 patients.

### The triangle of the vertebral artery [^c3601a70]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosurgical procedures such as proximal brachial plexus repair, scalenotomy, and direct isolation of the proximal vertebral artery require a good working knowledge of the triangle of the vertebral artery. This deep triangle of the neck is bound by the subclavian artery and the anterior scalene and longus cervicis muscles. In addition to the vertebral artery, many important structures are found in this area, such as the ganglionated sympathetic chain and certain cervical spinal nerves.

Methods

Twenty formalin-fixed cadavers were used for this study. Dissection of this triangle was performed, and measurements were made not only of parts of its borders, but also distances from these borders to neurologically important structures within its confines, such as the C8 spinal nerve.

Results

In all specimens, the middle scalene muscle was noted to form part of the posterior wall of the triangle. The mean height of the triangle was found to be 3.2 cm, and the mean width of its base was 1.3 cm. We observed that the C8 spinal nerve had a mean distance of 1.2 cm inferior to the apex of the triangle and that the C7 spinal nerve was found inside the triangle in 5% of sides. If the phrenic nerve entered the triangle, it was never found more than 6 mm medial to the anterior scalene muscle. The vertebral artery always traveled intimately along the lateral border of the longus cervicis muscle, and its lateral edge ranged 5 to 8 mm medial to the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle.

Conclusion

The C7 spinal nerve was observed in the triangle of the vertebral artery. In addition, the posterior border of the triangle of the vertebral artery was clearly defined in this study, and the middle scalene muscle could be used as a landmark. These data, coupled with our quantitation of parts and structures within the triangle, may assist neurosurgeons who operate on this area of the neck.

### Proposal for a trigonometric method to evaluate the abduction angle of the lower limbs in neonates [^e01c6495]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

It is difficult to precisely measure articular arc movement in newborns using a goniometer. This article proposes an objective method based on trigonometry for the evaluation of lower limb abduction. With the newborn aligned in the dorsal decubitus position, 2 points are marked at the level of the medial malleolus, one on the sagittal line and the other at the end of the abduction. Using the right-sided line between these 2 points and a line from the medial malleolus to the reference point at the anterior superior iliac spine or umbilical scar, an isosceles triangle is drawn, and half of the inferential abduction angle is obtained by calculating the sine. Twenty healthy full-term newborns comprise the study cohort. Intersubject and intrasubject variability among the abduction angle values (mean [SD], 37 degrees [4] degrees) is low. This method is advantageous because the measurement is precise and because the sine can be used without approximation.

### Nonossifying fibroma of the lower femur with genu valgum: a case report [^62874d13]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Ⓐ Planning the osteotomy angle and osteotomy direction. Ⓑ The length of the osteotomy was 12.6 mm. Ⓒ Confirming the osteotomy length during the operation (marked with red line)

We made a medial incision in the distal femur. An oval window was opened on the medial bone cortex, with a window area of approximately 5 × 1 cm. The diseased tissue in the medullary cavity was scraped off, the medullary cavity was ground with a grinding drill, the medullary cavity was burned with an electric knife, and finally, the tissue was soaked in anhydrous alcohol for five minutes. According to the preoperative design, two Kirschner wires were inserted and served as the osteotomy positioning guide needle. The angle was checked via fluoroscopy and determined to be too small; then, another Kirschner wire was implanted. On fluoroscopy, the osteotomy angle was good. The outermost two Kirschner wires were equivalent to two sides of the isosceles triangle planned in the preoperative design. The Kirschner wires intersected 5–10 mm inside the cortex of the lateral condyle of the femur, which was the hinge point of the osteotomy (Fig. 3 A). The distance between the two Kirschner wires (red lines on Fig. 2 C) was the bottom edge of the isosceles triangle planned preoperatively and was approximately 1.26 cm (Fig. 2 C). A wedge-shaped osteotomy was made with a pendulum saw was used to control the osteotomy depth, stopping when it was close to the contralateral cortex and protecting the contralateral hinge; then the osteotomy end was closed slowly (Fig. 3 B). After fluoroscopic examination indicated that the mechanical axis of right lower limb was satisfactory, the medial plate of the distal femur was implanted (Fig. 3 C). The flexion and extension function of the knee joint was good, and the fracture end was stable. After washing, the broken end medullary cavity was implanted with allogeneic bone, and the drainage tube was placed and sutured layer by layer.

### A new design for forearm skin flaps for areas that Do not require additional grafting [^959b9dbd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL REPORT

A 78-year-old female patient sought medical care at our department 4 years ago due to a malignant tumor on her right cheek. The TNM classification was determined as T3N0M0, and a biopsy confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical and pathologic staging was performed in accordance with the TNM criteria outlined in the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual. Following the exclusion of any contraindications for surgery, the patient underwent a procedure that involved an extended resection of the lesion on the right cheek, a modified radical neck dissection, and forearm skin flap reconstruction. To begin, an assumed coordinate system was established within the region designated for skin flap preparation. The x-axis was oriented along the course of the radial artery and vein, while the y-axis ran vertically through the midpoint of the forearm. The skin flap was designed to consist of two subunits, each taking the form of a half-ellipse symmetrically aligned with the Y-axis. The included angle between the 2 subunits formed a^-shape, measuring between 70 degrees and 90 degrees (Fig. 1 A). The skin flap needed to encompass the cephalic vein, radial artery, and radial vein. If the cephalic vein deviated from the flap, the x-axis could be moderately adjusted along the y-axis to ensure that the cephalic vein was enclosed within the flap. The roughly isosceles triangular area left between the 2 subunits was prepared as full-thickness skin. Following the planned removal of the 2 half-elliptical subunits, they were sutured and assembled along the long axis of the half-ellipse, thus completing the skin flap. Its dimensions were 7 cm along the long axis and 5 cm along the short axis (Fig. 1 B-D). The triangular skin piece reserved at the donor site was directly sutured to the outer skin (Fig. 1 E), resulting in a successful reconstruction of the cheek defect during surgery (Fig. 1 F). Postoperatively, the skin flap remained viable, and the donor site wound healed in the first phase (Fig. 1 G). Simultaneously, the primary lesion was excised, and the neck lymph node dissection was performed without complications. During a follow-up period of 4 years, there was no tumor recurrence, and the patient expressed great satisfaction with both the appearance and functionality of the reconstructed right cheek area.

### Increased tortuosity of basilar artery might be associated with higher risk of aneurysm development [^b21fb957]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The fourth is triangular index (TI), for which the curve is again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is defined as:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are sides of triangles and c is its base. The last of the tortuosity descriptors is the inflexion count metrics (ICM), defined as:where n I represents the number of the curve's inflexion points. All used tortuosity descriptors are all presented in Fig. 1.

Additional measurements

We additionally measured diameters of both P1 segments of posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and diameters of both vertebral arteries (VAs) at a distance of 5 mm from the origin of BA. We also measured the diameter of BA in three locations: 2 mm from its origin, 2 mm before its bifurcation and halfway between those two locations. Additionally, we obtained the angle of BA bifurcation and its configuration, introduced by Rashad et al including hands-up, hands-neutral and hands-down configurations, as well as its mixed variants (hands-up/hands-neutral, hands-up/hands-down, hands-neutral/hands-down). Among patients with BA aneurysm, we measured aneurysm dome height and width, as well as its neck size. We also calculated dome-to-neck ratio, defined as aneurysm dome height/neck size.

### Buckling cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral capsules and their propagation to a robust zeolite-like supramolecular framework [^ceca30e9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Crystalline cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral assembly

Inspection of the rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit in the case of 1 is unexpected among crystalline forms of coinage metallic clusters, which is evocative of an example of icosahedral viruses crystallized into cubic crystals in a similar dodecahedral shape. This inspire us to conjecture that extraordinary arrangement and packing of cluster tectons might exist. To our delight, the most attractive structural feature of 1 is that twelve molecular copper clusters per unit cell self-assemble into an enclosed approximately icosahedral capsule denoted as Cu 60 (Fig. 1d) with an approximate diameter of 3.0 nm. The surface of the pseudo icosahedron contains two types of triangular faces (Fig. 1e): 8 equilateral triangles and 12 isosceles triangles, each equilateral triangle with side lengths of 16 Å (the centroid-centroid distances of two adjacent clusters) and each isosceles triangle with side and base lengths of 16 and 13 Å, respectively. It is worth noting that this is the only possible combinatorial outcome for the pseudo icosahedron buckled from these equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles, based on the ChatGPT prediction. The internal hollow icosahedral capsule Cu 60 could accommodate a sphere with a diameter of about 25 Å, corresponding to a sphere volume of ~8177 Å. Our observation of the supramolecular icosahedral assembly that involves solid-state aggregation of individual clusters is intriguing. It was previously reported that atomically precise metal nanoclusters functionalized with capsid-targeting ligands which were used to label specific components of the surface of enteroviruses created icosahedral arrangement of clusters. But once the absence of capsid-targeting ligands and without linking to the viral surfaces, cluster-based icosahedra are difficult to achieve. More importantly, the atomically accurate cluster-based icosahedral capsule will provide much more detailed information for further identifying the possible assembled origin of the icosahedron as the largest of the Platonic solids.

### Triangular backgrounds shift the bias of line bisection performance in hemispatial neglect [^0f332b29]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with left neglect on line bisection show normal implicit sensitivity to manipulations of both the stimulus and the visual background. Three experiments were designed to define this sensitivity more exactly.

Methods

Normal controls and patients with left neglect performed a series of horizontal line bisection tasks. Independent variables were the configurations of the backgrounds for the line-rectangle, square, circle, left and right pointing isosceles triangles-and whether the background was the shape of the piece of paper or an outline drawn on a standard piece of paper. In a separate experiment different components of the triangle were outlined on a piece of paper. Deviation from true midpoint was calculated.

Results

Simply placing the target lines in a symmetric background such as a square or circle did not reliably reduce neglect. A triangle asymmetric in the horizontal plane caused a shift in bisection away from the triangle's vertex. With right pointing triangles the perceived midpoint shifted to the left of true centre (crossed over). The effects of the triangles were comparable in the patients and the controls when controlled for baseline bisection bias. The critical components of the triangles were the angular legs. This effect of background was not influenced by lesion site or by hemianopia.

Conclusions

Patients with left visual neglect remain sensitive to covert manipulations of the visual background that implicitly shift the perceived midpoint of a horizontal line. This effect is strong enough to eliminate neglect on a bisection task. The mechanism of this effect is expressed through preattentive visual capacities.

### Finite element analysis of the effect of cannulated screw placement and drilling frequency on femoral neck fracture fixation [^34ccad6f]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Positioning of the implanted cannulated screw is paramount for stable femoral neck fracture fixation. To avoid overdrilling, the aim of this study is to determine the optimum configuration of three cannulated screws employed in femoral neck fracture fixation.

Methods

Using a CT scan from a 28 year old healthy male, several models of femoral neck fracture fixation were developed using finite element analysis. After drilling small holes (in either fixed or random patterns) for screw insertion, the mechanical stresses on the screws were compared for three fracture types.

Results

The inverted isosceles triangle was found to be the best screw configuration. Using finite element analysis, the upper limit of drilling frequency and the maximum stress on the screws for 30°, 50°, and 70° drilling were 14, 16, and 19 times and 46.1MPa, 61.9MPa, and 51.0MPa, respectively. The upper limit of drilling frequency and the maximum stress on the screws for subcapital type, transcervical type, and basicervical type were 14, 16, and 40 times and 24.7MPa, 61.9MPa, and 113.5MPa, respectively.

Conclusions

Results of this study had supported the use of the inverted isosceles triangle as the best screw configuration for femoral neck fracture fixation. Screw position, Pauwels angle, and drilling frequency can all affect the mechanical strength of femoral neck fracture fixation.

### Lateral (left-right commissural) root enlargement may reduce risk of coronary artery obstruction from transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation [^6df6e3f8]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Technique

The aorta is opened anteriorly 1 cm above the sinotubular junction (STJ), and extended leftward, to curve down through the STJ, to the top of the LR commissure. The aortic leaflets are excised. After separating the aorta from the pulmonary artery behind the LR commissure, the aortotomy is extended further, splitting the LR commissure along its length, into the subcommissural triangle, stopping 3 mm before entering septal myocardium (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Operative technique illustrated. A, After cardioplegic arrest, the main pulmonary artery (PA) and proximal ascending aorta are separated (blue arrowhead); an aortotomy is made starting 1 cm above the sinotubular junction (STJ) anteriorly above the right coronary artery, and curved toward the top of the left-right (LR) commissure laterally, and transversely in a medial direction. B, Retraction sutures are placed, and the diseased aortic valve is inspected and excised. C, Using cautery and scissors, the plane between the aorta and PA behind the LR commissure is developed (blue arrowhead), and then the aortotomy is extended 1 to 1.5 cm further down the middle of the LR commissure (blue dotted line), remaining within aortic tissue (in the subcommissural triangle) and avoiding septal myocardium (red X). D, This opens a V -shaped cleft through the commissure. The plane between aorta and PA (blue arrowhead) may need to be developed more thoroughly to mobilize the cut aortic edges. E, A 4 × 4 cm piece of bovine pericardium or 5 cm length of 8 mm polyethylene terephthalate tube graft split open down its length (Boston Scientific Corporation) is then fashioned into a 5- to 6-cm long and 2- to 2.5-cm wide patch with 45° diamond-shaped short ends, and is sewn smooth side facing inward, to the cleft in the LR commissure using a 4–0 polypropylene continuous suture line with small, closely-spaced bites. After parachuting the valve down into place, care is taken to invert the edges of the patch, especially for the portion of the suture line above the annulus, so that the rough side of the patch meets the adventitia of the aorta; this encourages the patch to bulge outward from the aorta. F, It is best if the suture line is continued on both sides of the patch beyond the STJ, before implanting the valve. The surgical aortic valve suture line (blue dotted line) should pass through the patch; and the patch should have been fashioned so it is at least 6-mm wide at the level where the annulus and valve suture line intersect it. G, Once the valve is seated and tied down, there will be a few millimeters of separation behind the LR strut of the surgical bioprosthesis in front of the patch. H, Finally, the remainder of the patch is incorporated into the closure and billows outward when pressurized after completion of the closure.

Preoperative Marking

(A) Mark a point about 7 cm lateral to the sternal notch along the clavicle (Fig. 1).
(B) Draw a line from Point A through the nipple downward through the breast meridian.
(C) Lift the breast and mark the inframammary fold (IMF).
(D) Mark Point D about 2.5–3 cm lateral to the midline so that it crosses the IMF medially with the aim of shifting the most medial end of the inframammary scar away from the sternal midline.
(E) Line B crosses the IMF through the breast meridian about 10–11 cm from the sternal midline, in thin patients sometimes at a shorter distance.
(F) Laterally the IMF should go slightly upward following the natural breast shape. If the natural breast shape does not go slightly upward, especially in very large breasts, draw the IMF going slightly upward laterally (K2) (Fig. 2).
(G) The location of the upper border of the areola opening is determined through a combination of established guidelines (Fig. 3) as follows: Projection of the IMF to the front of the breast is done by pinching the breast between the thumb and the index finger (Fig. 3). This gives the approximate location of the upper border of the areola opening. Mark the middle of the upper arm; the upper border of the areola opening should be at about this height. Keep in mind the patient's height and age. In very tall patients, the distance H (Fig. 2) from the jugulum to the future nipple position is larger than in short patients. In young patients, the distance H is shorter than in older patients. If someone with severely ptotic breasts has a long superior medial pedicle and thus is at a higher risk for areola perfusion impairment, it is better to keep the future areola position slightly lower in order to reduce this risk.
(H) H is the distance from the sternal notch to the future upper border of the areola opening (G) (Fig. 2).
(I) Draw a 90° triangle, with the highest point being the future upper border of the areola opening (G). The angle between the vertical sides of the triangle should measure between 80 and 70° (Fig. 4). Draw the 90° triangle with a broken line as a reference guideline. Then mark the sides of an 80° angle with a solid line, giving cranial 4 cm for the areola opening and caudal 6 cm for each of the vertical sides. Length of the vertical lines: (i) If the patient is very small, you can also draw the caudal portion as 5 cm. (ii) If the patient is at risk for perfusion impairment of the areola due to a long superior medial pedicle, make the vertical lines longer, namely 7–8 cm, in order to make the pedicle wider and optimize blood perfusion. (iii) If you perform a one-sided reduction/mastopexy to achieve symmetry, measure the vertical line on the contralateral breast and mark roughly the same length on the reduction side. How to determine the angle between the vertical sides of the triangle: (i) In breasts that are not too firm, 80° usually works well. (ii) In patients who present with very firm breast tissue, we recommend marking the breast primarily at 70° in order to avoid problems with wound closure due to tension. It can always be enlarged intraoperatively, if necessary, by medial deepithelialization and lateral resection. (iii) Always perform the pinch test on the vertical lines. Measure the horizontal medial and lateral lines: J1/J2 and K1/K2 should have approximately the same length. A difference of about 1–2 cm between J1/J2 and K1/K2 can usually be tolerated, while in very large breasts the difference, especially lateral, can sometimes be even larger (Fig. 2).
(J) Horizontal lines medial
(K) Horizontal lines lateral
(L) The cranial 4 cm of the vertical sides of the triangle correlate with the areola opening (Fig. 4). The circumference of the areola opening should match the circumference of the 4 cm areola. You can easily mark the areola opening using a semicircular template. You can create a model using paper or a more rigid material like wood or cardboard with a 4 cm diameter (M).
(M) 4 cm diameter semicircular template (Fig. 4)
(N) Along the upper border of the areola opening there is a dip (G) created where the two semicircles come together (Fig. 4). The two semicircles have to be joined with a straight line (N), which is usually about 0.5 cm higher than the point where the two semicircles originally met. You have to remember this when initially planning the upper border of the areola opening, because the upper border will ultimately be 0.5 cm higher than in your original drawing.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^2f8c1997]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies — key disease and protein terms are defined as follows: Monoclonal gammopathy is "a condition in which monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins circulate in the blood", and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is "the most common category of monoclonal gammopathy, which is asymptomatic and requires no intervention in the vast majority of cases". Monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M‑protein) are "immunoglobulin proteins produced by monoclonal plasma cells", and the M spike or M‑spike "refers to the narrow, isosceles triangle appearance of the monoclonal immunoglobulin protein seen on protein electrophoresis". Multiple myeloma is described as "a cancer of plasma cells" in which "multiple myeloma caused the plasma cells to accumulate in the bone marrow and crowd out the healthy blood cells". The free kappa/free lambda ratio is "the ratio of two types of immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda) when not bound to immunoglobulin heavy chains" and "is used to assess risk of harboring a monoclonal protein and its likelihood for progression". Cross‑references indicate "M-component — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", "Monoclonal Protein — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", and "Paraproteins — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein". POEMS is a "rare multisystem disorder characterized by (P) polyneuropathy, (O) organomegaly, (E) endocrinopathy, (M) monoclonal gammopathy, and (S) skin abnormalities".

### Preoperative volume estimation in transverse upper gracilis flap surgery: a pilot study [^15a64ad6]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The transverse upper gracilis (TUG) flap provides a good alternative to the gold standard DIEP in breast reconstruction. However, flap volume estimates are subjective, making preoperative planning potentially challenging.

Study Aim

To derive a reliable, accurate, and reproducible mathematical algorithm for the preoperative calculation of TUG flap volumes.

Materials and Methods

Nineteen consecutive patients with 30 TUG flaps were prospectively included. On the assumption that the TUG flap resembles two isosceles prisms, the formula of the volume of a prism was used to calculate their preoperative flap weights. These were then intraoperatively compared to the actual flap weights. A regression equation was calculated from the correlation analysis of 10 random flaps. This was then applied to the remaining 20 flaps to assess for improved reliability and weight prediction accuracy.

Results

The prism volume equation used to clinically calculate flap volumes was: Geometric flap weight = [h₁bT/2] + [h₂bT/2], (h = height, b = base, T = flap thickness); all in centimetres. Geometric and actual flap weights were found to be significantly correlated (r² = 0.977) generating the following regression formula: predicted TUG weight = 0.924 × geometric weight + 26.601. When this was applied to the remaining 20 flaps, no significant difference was found (p = 0.625) between predicted and actual flap weights, demonstrating an increased accuracy of predicting flap volume.

Conclusion

The proposed formula provides the clinician with a more accurate and reliable estimation of available TUG flap volume and may potentially aid with preoperative planning and patient consultations.

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^2276eaf7]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Estimation of the volume of the fixed lung (Step 3) according to the Archimedes principle. Based on buoyancy, the weight of the displaced fluid (e.g. saline) is measured. Since the fixed lung is lighter than the fluid, it tends to emerge and thus has to be submerged by a coiled wire connected to a lab stand. The lung and wire must not touch the wall of the beaker. The wire has a mark to adjust it to the fluid level before and during measurements to make sure it does not contribute to the measured volume. The volume of the lung (in mL or cm 3) is shown as weight gain (in g)

Fig. 3
Estimation of the volume of the fixed lung (Step 3) according to the Cavalieri estimator and subsequent sampling. a The lung is embedded in agar and cut into slices of equal thickness t, with a random start in the agar outside the lung, thus following the principles of systematic uniform random sampling (SURS). Slice thickness t is adjusted to obtain around 8–10 slices. b The slices are placed on a tray with a consistent orientation, e.g. all apical surfaces upwards. The total volume of the lung, V, is calculated as the sum of the cut surface areas, A, of all slices (indicated in red in a) multiplied by the slice thickness t: V = ΣA · t. The cut surface areas, A, are estimated by counting points, P, hitting the cut surface areas using a grid with a known area per point, a(p), as: V = ΣP · a(p) · t. A constant definition for a point "hit", P, is needed, e.g. the upper right corner of the crosses that symbolize the test points (indicated by red arrow). Based on this definition, correct point counts are shown in red. Note that in this example, where the slices are oriented with their apical side upwards, the first slice does not contain an apical cut surface and thus does not contribute any point counts. Accordingly, the uncut pleura at the lateral sides, here visible on the first four slices when viewed from above (grey), is also excluded (black test points) whereas the cut pleura at the apical surfaces (black) is included (red test points). c This collection of fixed lung slices can also be used as the starting point for SURS (Step 4). For example, if 3 different embedding protocols shall be used in the study (e.g. embedding in glycol methacrylate for light microscopic stereology, embedding in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and embedding of smaller subsamples in epon for electron microscopy), the slices are randomly assigned to these 3 protocols with a constant sampling interval (here 3). Thus, slices 1, 4 and 7 will be embedded according to protocol 1, slices 2, 5 and 8 will be embedded according to protocol 2 and slices 3, 6 and 9 will be embedded according to protocol 3. Note that all slices have to be sampled for embedding, even those who had to be excluded from the Cavalieri estimator (here slice 1). Also note that each of these 3 subsamples obtained by SURS constitutes a fraction of 1/3 of the whole lung. They can therefore also be used as starting point for fractionator sampling. d The principle of SURS consists of a random component (the selection of the first sample) and a systematic uniform component (the constant sampling interval for the selection of all other samples). SURS also applies to the subsequent stages of the sampling sequence, such as the selection of smaller subsamples (e.g. for electron microscopy) or the selection of fields of view on histologic sections from an embedded lung slice. The sampling interval is adjusted to achieve the desired number of samples

### Midsubtemporal ridge as a predictor of the lateral loop formed by the maxillary nerve and mandibular nerve: a cadaveric morphological study [^140b38d3]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The lateral loop formed by the maxillary nerve (V2) and the mandibular nerve (V3) consists of a part of the far lateral triangle of the cavernous sinus. Because this triangle becomes a surgical corridor of the preauricular infratemporal fossa approach and a landmark of the extradural approach for the ganglion-type trigeminal schwannomas, identification of the lateral loop has important implications at the early stage of middle cranial base surgery. We realized that a bony ridge usually existed just lateral to the lateral loop.

Objective

To nominate midsubtemporal ridge (MSR) as the name for this anatomically unnamed bony ridge and to clarify its features.

Methods

Using 35 cadaver heads, we measured the shape of the MSR on both sides and the distance between the MSR and the adjacent structures.

Results

The MSR was recognized in 60 of 70 specimens (85.7%). The bony protrusion was 2.9 ± 1.1 mm in height, 6.0 ± 2.1 mm in width, and 9.1 ± 3.2 mm in length. A single peak with anteroposterior length was common in 47 of 60 specimens (78.3%). The MSR was located at the midpoint of the V2 and V3 in 28 specimens (46.7%) and existed 10.7 ± 3.6 mm lateral from the line that bound the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale.

Conclusion

We demonstrate morphological characteristics of the MSR. These data on the MSR will assist the surgeon in identifying the lateral loop as a surgical landmark during middle cranial base surgery.

### An anatomical study of the transversus abdominis plane block: location of the lumbar triangle of petit and adjacent nerves [^e1c48dbd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a new technique for providing analgesia to the anterior abdominal wall. Most previous studies have used the lumbar triangle of Petit as a landmark for the block. In this cadaveric study, we determined the exact position and size of the lumbar triangle of Petit and identified the nerves affected by the TAP block.

Methods

The position of the lumbar triangle of Petit was assessed unilaterally in 26 cadaveric specimens relative to reliably palpable surface landmarks. In addition, a series of dissections were performed to explore the course of the nerves blocked by the TAP.

Results

The mean distance from the midaxillary line along the iliac crest to the center of the base of the lumbar triangle of Petit at the level of the subcutaneous tissue and over the skin surface was 6.9 cm (range, 4.5–9.2 cm) and 9.3 cm (range, 4–15.1 cm), respectively. The center of the lumbar triangle of Petit was 1.4 cm above the iliac crest. The depth of the TAP at the lumbar triangle of Petit position was 0.5–4 cm and at the midaxillary line it was 0.5–2 cm. The average size of the lumbar triangle of Petit was 2.3 cm x 3.3 cm x 2.2 cm, with an average area of 3.63 ± 1.93 cm2. The three cadaveric specimens we explored showed the nerves blocked by TAP passed lateral to the triangle. An incidental finding was that in 66% of specimens the lumbar triangle of Petit contained small branches of the subcostal artery.

Conclusions

The lumbar triangles of Petit found in the specimens in this study were more posterior than the literature suggests. The position of the lumbar triangle of Petit varies largely and the size is relatively small. The relevant nerves to be blocked had not entered the TAP in the specimens in this study at the point of the lumbar triangle of Petit. At the midaxillary line, however, all the nerves were in the TAP.

### Do upper and lower orbital fat have a connection? [^f2859ffd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

This study, using cadavers, was conducted to determine whether there is a true connection between upper and lower orbital fat. A total of 39 orbits of 20 fresh Korean adult cadavers were used. Colored gelatin was injected into the upper or lower peripheral fat (preaponeurotic fat) of each orbit. One week after injection, dissection was continued and connection of the upper and lower orbital fat was examined. No migration of gelatin injected into the upper or to the central fat (intermuscular cone fat) was observed. However, migration of gelatin injected into the upper or lower preaponeurotic fat into the entire episcleral space through the adipose orifice (AO) was observed. The 3 sides of the upper AO consisted of the superior oblique muscle before the trochlea, superior oblique tendon after the trochlea, and sclera. The 3 sides of the lower AO consisted of the inferior oblique muscle, lateral rectus muscle, and fascia between the inferior rectus muscle and lateral rectus muscle. The upper AO was located at the medial one third of the orbital width and superior one fifth of the orbital height. The lower AO was located at the lateral one third of the orbital width and inferior one fifth of the orbital height. The shape of the upper AO was a triangle with a base of 4.3 ± 2.0 mm and a height of 2.3 ± 1.2 mm. The shape of the lower AO was a triangle with a base of 4.5 ± 1.8 mm and a height of 2.7 ± 1.1 mm. We think that surgical obliteration of the AO might prevent migration of preaponeurotic fats. Prevention of migration of preaponeurotic fats will aid in avoidance of baggy lower eyelid or deepening of the supratarsal fold.

### Prominent effects and neural correlates of visual crowding in a neurodegenerative disease population [^527ea900]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Task 3: Shape flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by a triangle presented at different orientations. Triangles were of equal height and line thickness to target letters.

Task 4: Number flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by an Arabic numeral, chosen from a range between 2 and 9.

Task 5: Same-polarity flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by black letters; presentation was as Task 2 except that items were presented on a grey background to match Task 6 (see below).

Task 6: Reverse-polarity flankers

Target black letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by white letters, all presented on a grey background.

The edge-to-edge distance between the target letter and flankers was 0.1° of visual angle in the condensed condition and 1.0° in the spaced condition at a viewing distance of 50 cm; the height of stimuli (10.5 mm) corresponded to a visual angle of 1.20°. Participants were given one prompt for each trial where they named the flanker ('Is that the letter in the middle?'); this prompt was intended to limit errors resulting from visual disorientation. The same combination of flankers was used for each target letter under both spatial conditions within each flanker condition. Alphabetic items occurred with equal frequency within each task. The stimuli were presented in blocks of six items, with blocks being administered in an ABBA design. All flanked stimuli were presented in the centre of the screen within a fixation box (6.4° in width, 2.9° in height). All 26 patients with PCA completed Tasks 1, 2 and 4; 24 completed Task 3; and 22 completed Tasks 5 and 6. Naming latencies were manually determined from the onset of each letter using Audacity.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Metamaterial bricks and quantization of meta-surfaces [^8ab727ca]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Metamaterial bricks

To form a desired acoustic field with exceptional performance, the metamaterial bricks should possess the ability to transmit sound effectively, locally shift phase with a 2 π range, and hold sub-wavelength spatial resolution to avoid spatial aliasing effects. By spatially tailoring the geometry of the bricks in a planar meta-surface, one can modulate the transmitted waves in nearly arbitrary ways in a specific frequency range. While most of the other studies explore the audible range, our metamaterial bricks are designed for operation in the ultrasonic range at 40 kHz (wavelength λ 0 ≈8.66 mm in air at 25 °C). As shown in Fig. 3a, each brick appears geometrically like a rectangular cuboid with a square base-shape of side λ 0 /2 and a height of λ 0, and consists of an open central channel that delays the incident wave, hence shifting the relative phase of the output. The channel topology is designed to be suitable for microfabrication (see Methods) and was inspired by a pool of alternative designs, where some of these are based on the pioneering work on coiling space by Liang and Li. Fully 3D bricks are constructed by extruding the surface of four parallel bars (of variable spacing and length) positioned orthogonally to the wave direction, thereby creating a labyrinth meander. The inter-bar spacing b s and bar length b l can be effectively tuned, resulting in a phase shift covering a 2 π span (Supplementary Fig. 3). Simulations showed that a uniform 4-bit quantization of the phase space can reproduce any focused field (with a focal length between 3 λ 0 and 47 λ 0) with an error of < 0.1 dB (Supplementary Fig. 2), so sixteen bricks were designed — corresponding to delays ofin phase. Figure 3b shows full-wave simulations (see Methods) of the pressure field distributions when a plane wave travels through each of the 16 selected bricks. While the design of the bricks is not unique (Supplementary Note 3), an important feature of the selected geometry is that the effective acoustic impedance of each brick is matched to that of air, increasing the efficiency of wave transmission and suppressing reflection. In fact, the average transmission magnitude over all units, according to our full-wave simulations, is > 98% (Supplementary Table 1). We then manufactured in advance, by rapid prototyping, a set of 16 types of bricks, which could be mounted into a laser-cut grid frame structure, where each grid-square contains 4 bricks in a 2 × 2 assembly (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Video 1). Transmission measurements for three selected bricks (see Methods) confirmed an experimental average transmission of 97 ± 5%, within 10% from the predicted values. Note that functionally, each brick presents a directivity pattern, which depends on its internal topology and on the frequency used. Hence, to reduce unwanted steering effects, the bricks were assembled with a random orientation.

### Should the meniscal height be considered for preoperative sizing in meniscal transplantation? [^bc74cb1a]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the mean and SD values of the meniscal dimensions. Inter-observer reliability was excellent (ICC > 0.8) for length and height measurements and good (ICC between 0.6 and 0.8) for width measurements. There was also excellent agreement (ICC > 0.8) for the length and width of the menisci in the right and left knees. As for the heights of the meniscal segments, the heights of the horns of the lateral meniscus, both anterior and posterior, showed good agreement (ICC between 0.6 and 0.8), while the heights of the other meniscal segments had excellent agreement between the sides (ICC > 0.8) (Table 2).

There were statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations between the heights of the meniscal segments and the lengths and widths of the menisci, between the meniscal height and anthropometric data (weight and height), and between the meniscal segments' heights in the same meniscus. Although these associations were statistically significant, the correlation values were generally low (r < 0.5) (Tables 3, 4, 5). We found statistically significant associations and generally high (r > 0.7) correlations between anthropometric data and meniscal length and width (Tables 3, 4).

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^c98160a8]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy before surgery (A–C). The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal end of the humerus (line AB). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction. The lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site. D, The distal lateral humeral marking line (solid line). DAE refers to the included angle formed by the intersection of line DA and line AE.

The patient was supine, and the affected side was abducted and placed on the abduction operation platform. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a tourniquet. A 4 to 6 cm longitudinal incision was made over the lateral distal humerus and the interval between the brachioradialis and triceps muscles was developed. The distal humerus was exposed circumferentially by subperiosteal dissection. First, a longitudinal marking line was marked on the lateral edge of the distal humerus with an electric motor saw for alignment of the lateral edge after osteotomy and correction of distal humeral hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). A 2.0 mm Kirschner wire (K -wire) was inserted from the lateral edge of the humerus under fluoroscopy, 0.5 to 1 cm above the olecranon fossa, and perpendicular to the lateral edge of the distal end of the humeral osteotomy (Fig. 1 A) to locate the initial osteotomy line (line AB), and then osteotomy was performed with an electric motor saw along the direction of the K -wire. Using a goniometer and scale, all lines as preoperative planned were drawn on the proximal end of the humeral osteotomy, and osteotomy cuts were made accordingly. The right-angled triangle-shaped bone was removed (Fig. 1 B) and the lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site to correct the varus on the coronal plane (Fig. 1 C). According to the longitudinal marking line of the lateral edge of the distal humerus, the distal end of the humeral osteotomy was tilted forward to correct the elbow hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). The osteotomy site was cross-pinned with 1.5 to 2.0 mm K -wires (Fig. 2). Stability of the construct was confirmed by taking fluoroscopic views under valgus and varus stress. Additional K -wires or screws could be used if required according to stability. After wound closure, a long-arm cast was applied with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the forearm was in a neutral position.

### Superficial landmarks for the spinal accessory nerve within the posterior cervical triangle [^cba0235f]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The spinal accessory nerve (SAN) within the posterior cervical triangle (PCT) is the most commonly iatrogenically injured nerve in the body. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of published information regarding superficial landmarks for the SAN in this region. Additional identifiable landmarks of this nerve may assist the surgeon in identifying it for repair, use of it in peripheral nerve neurotization, or avoiding it as in proximal brachial plexus repair. The present study was undertaken to provide reliable superficial landmarks for the identification of the SAN within the PCT.

Methods

The PCT was dissected in 30 cadaveric sides. Measurements were made between the SAN and surrounding landmarks. The mean distances between the entry site of the SAN into the trapezius and a midpoint of the clavicle, mastoid process, acromion process, and lateral aspect of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle were 6, 7, 5.5, and 3.5 cm, respectively. The mean distances between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process and the exit point of the SAN from the posterior border of the SCM muscle were 6 and 5 cm, respectively. The mean width and length of the SAN were 3 and 3.5 cm, respectively.

Conclusions

It is the authors' hope that these data will aid those who may need to locate or avoid the SAN while undertaking surgery in the PCT and thus decrease morbidity that may follow manipulation of this region.

Assessment of Tumor Height (Distance Between AV and Distal Tumor Margin)

Assessment of the tumor height showed excellent interrater reliability with an ICC of 0.947 (95% CI, 0.918–0.967, p < 0.001; Tables 1 and 4).

TABLE 4.
Tumor height: measured distance of lower border of tumor from AV

A total agreement (≤ 1 cm difference in measurements within a measurement corridor of ≤ 2 cm) of all 4 investigators was reached in 52% (n = 26) of cases, 75% agreement in 34% (n = 17), and 50% agreement in 14% (n = 7).

The difference between the highest and lowest height measurements had a median of 2 cm (range, 5 cm [0–5 cm]; IQR: 2 cm).

The mean tumor height was 9.52 cm (SD: 2.921 cm) with a range of 13 cm (3–16 cm).

Interrater reliability was excellent for both the subgroup of patients examined in the LL position (ICC: 0.914; 95% CI, 0.848–0.951, p < 0.001) and those examined in the LIT position (ICC: 0.909; 95% CI, 0.840–0.948, p < 0.001).

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^bbbb2306]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

During the time between October 2017 and May 2020, 22 elbows with posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity were treated by means of a modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy at the Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics of our hospital. All procedures were carried out by a single senior surgeon. The surgical indication was that the difference between the affected side and the healthy contralateral side was at least 20 degrees and the parents requested surgical treatment. The 22 patients involved included 6 female and 16 male patients with an average age of 10.3 years (range, 8 to 13 years) at the time of the osteotomy. The average time from injury to the osteotomy was 2.2 years (range, 1.1 to 3.2 years). Thirteen patients had a right-sided deformity and 9 had a left-sided deformity. All patients presented with an extension type of supracondylar fracture at the time of injury. The procedures were performed after the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from the patients and their families.

Preoperative Planning and Operative Technique

Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy was performed before surgery. The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal humerus (line AB) (Fig. 1 A). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction (Fig. 1 B). The intended angle of correction was equal to the sum of the carrying angle of the normal side plus the varus angle of the affected side and the expectation of 5 degrees of correction loss after surgery. According to the relevant knowledge of the right triangle, the angle DBA was equal to the angle DAE, which was the expected correction angle. After the inverted right triangle, ADB was cut off at the proximal end of the humerus osteotomy, and the apex A of the distal humeral osteotomy segment was rotated inward and overlapped with the apex D to complete the distal humeral valgus osteotomy (Fig. 1 C).

### A road map through the multi-faceted world of female genital cosmetic surgical techniques [^0caeba86]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Inferior wedge resection technique

In this case the wedge is performed more inferiorly, and it is preferred when the labia minora are wider inferiorly. This technique helps in reaching anatomic results that are satisfactory for 93% of patients; the other 7% undergo secondary labiaplasty because of minimal wound dehiscence that resulted in an imperfect esthetic outcome. One clamp is placed on the posterior part of the labia, and another is positioned to form a 90° angle with the first. The V‐shaped area of redundant labial tissue bounded by the two clamps is excised, leaving an anterior flap that will form a minor labium of the desired size. The anterior labial flap is gently stretched out, placed without tension, and secured to the underlying connective tissue with a 4–0 Polyglactin suture. Continuous sutures are used to close the surface under the flap and the inner and outer edges of the flap to the vulvar mucosa. An improvement of the original technique described by Alterin 1998 and modified by Rouzier et al.in 2000 was proposed by Munhoz et al.in 2006: in their studies they described the procedure based on the resection of the lower wedge of the labia minora and the reconstruction of the upper pedicle flap. The technique is indicated in patients with moderate to large labia minora hypertrophy with a size greater than 3 cm (measured horizontally from the midline applying minimal lateral tension). For this reason, a thorough inspection of the genitals before the operation is indicated. The pinching test is also performed: a small forceps is placed on the central part of the labia minora (point A) which is stretched inferiorly, towards the back of the vagina (point B). In case of skin tension, the forceps are moved upwards; Otherwise, if skin laxity is noticed, the forceps are moved down to resect more tissue. A wedge‐shaped area located between the two points, the edge of the labia and its base, represents the area of tissue to be resected, which varies depending on excess tissue and skin‐mucosal laxity. According to this procedure, it is possible to simulate the final esthetic result and estimate the amount of tissue that needs to be resected and the extension of the upper flap. The upper wedge‐shaped flap is designed on the remaining top of the labia minora between the A‐spot (tip) and the clitoral region (base). For moderate hypertrophy, the area to be resected is planned as an isosceles triangle located at the bottom of the labia minora. In cases of significant hypertrophy, the tissue to be excised may extend to the anterior region of the labia minora. The incision lines are then drawn more obliquely with curved edges, creating a convex shape. This approach allows for the removal of a larger portion of skin and mucosa, resulting in a thin upper flap. First, local anesthesia is performed: this promotes vasoconstriction and separation of the layers, increasing the virtual space of the subcutaneous tissue, to favor the technique. A cutaneous incision is made in the subcutaneous tissue on the medial layer of the labium minora and a complementary one on the lateral layer by resecting the total area in a wedge shape and suturing with absorbable stitches.

### State of the art design protocol for custom made footwear for people with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy [^18cbe790]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

3.1.4 Shoe outsole

The shoe outsole should provide cushioning and can be made supple or toughened, or can be reinforced with a carbon or metal layer over the partial or entire length of the shoe to create a stiff outsole that is not bendable. With clearly reduced proprioception, opt for a toughened and not a stiff outsole. Pay attention to sufficient traction of the outsole in these patients with peripheral neuropathy.

3.1.5 Tongue

The tongue of the shoe can be made supple, toughened, or stiff and is always padded. A stiff tongue is used mainly with forefoot amputation.

3.1.6 Heel of the shoe

The heel of the shoe can take several configurations. Normal heel height for men is 1.5‐2 cm and for women 2.5‐3 cm. An increased heel lift is provided in fully custom‐made shoes via heel lift in the shoe, in prefabricated shoes via heel lift in the insole (maximum 1 cm). Increased heel lift in pes equines is dependent on the available ankle range of motion. Lateral or medical heel flare can be given if there is varus or valgus tilting of the calcaneus, in order to normalize the centre of pressure.

3.1.7 Insole base

The base of the insole in a fully custom‐made shoe should be of 5‐mm‐thick micro cork (shore 55) with on top 5‐mm‐thick Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) (shore 35‐40). With prefabricated shoes the base should consist of 6‐mm‐thick EVA (shore 35‐40). The use of materials with proven similar properties in mainly compressibility and durability is also possible. 26

3.1.8 Insole top layer

The top layer of the insole should be a combination of 3‐mm‐thick closed‐cell foam (eg, Plastazote type LD45) on top of 3‐mm‐thick open‐cell cushioning foam (eg, Professional Protective Technology (PPT)), over its entire length. The combination of Plastazote and PPT has shown to be effective in pressure relief, 10 but the use of materials with similar properties is also possible. A leather top layer has proven ineffective in pressure relief and should not be used. 10

FIGURE 2
A, Preoperative x-ray of 9-year-old boy of left-sided cubitus varus; (B and C) the same patient treated by a modified inverse right-angled triangle osteotomy and fixation by K -wires.

All the patients underwent follow-up by clinical–radiologic means at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperative period, respectively. The clinical and radiologic parameters were recorded in the postoperative period. The patient's clinical evaluation included measurement of varus angulation, carrying angle, and range of motion (ROM) of the elbow before surgery and at the final follow-up. Functional outcome was graded as per criteria described by Oppenheim et alas excellent, good, and poor. An excellent result included correction of the varus deformity to within 5 degrees of the contralateral elbow, motion to within 5 degrees of the preoperative flexion and rotation arcs, and no perioperative complications. A good result demonstrated a valgus position and motion to within at least 10 degrees of the preoperative arcs. A poor result was assigned to any case with a complication, residual varus, or loss of more than 10 degrees in any plane of motion compared with the preoperative examination. Radiologic evaluation included an anteroposterior view and a lateral view of the elbow on both sides with the contralateral side as a control. The carrying angle can be determined radiologically by the humerus-elbow-wrist (HEW) angle, which was measured on the anteroposterior view of the elbow. A line passed through the middle longitudinal axis of the lower 1/3 of the humerus, and then drew a second line between the radius and the ulna along the middle longitudinal axis of the upper 1/3 of the forearm. The extension lines of these 2 lines intersect at the supracondylar part and the intersection angle is the HEW angle (Fig. 3 A). The HEW angle was radiographically assessed before surgery and at the final follow-up. The lateral condylar prominence index (LCPI) was measured by drawing the longitudinal humeral axis to the transepicondylar line, which divided the transepicondylar line into lateral and medial parts (Fig. 3 B). Then the ratio of the difference between lateral and medial distance and total transepicondylar distance was calculated and called as LCPI.

Figure 4.
The dedicated software reconstructs anatomic 3D images of mitral apparatus in each phase including measurement of mitral annular area, annular circumference, maximal antero‐posterior diameter, maximal intercommissural diameter, leaflet maximal tenting volume, papillary muscle area (the area of the triangle formed between both papillary tips and midanterior annulus), length of posterior papillary tip to midanterior annulus, length anterior papillary tip to midanterior annulus, interpapillary tips distance, and the acute angle of the triangle formed between papillary tips and midanterior annulus. The figure shows the midsystolic images in an "oblique representation" (left images), and the "en face" view (right images). Tenting volume, annulus and papillary muscle position in controls (upper left figure), LVD‐noMR patients (middle left figure) and LVD‐FMR patients (lower left figure) are illustrated in the oblique representations, and mitral annular area, annular circumference, maximal antero‐posterior diameter, and maximal intercommissural diameter in the same groups are depicted in the "en face" (right) figures. In controls tenting volume is minimal, annulus has a deep saddle shape and papillary muscles are positioned symmetrically in front of the midanterior annulus (upper left figure). In midsystole the annulus assumes an elliptical appearance with maximal antero‐posterior diameter being smaller than intercommisural diameter due to the significant antero‐posterior contraction and annular folding in the intercommissural axis in early‐systole (upper right figure). In LVD‐noMR patients tenting volume is larger and so is the annulus and papillary muscles to midanterior annulus distances but the annulus maintains the normal deep saddle shape, the posterior and anterior papillary muscle to midannulus distances are similar and symmetric (middle‐left figure) and the annulus maintains an elliptical appearance (middle‐right figure). Importantly, the intersection of the maximal anterior to posterior dimension line and the medial to lateral dimension line is not at the center of the annulus, showing some distortion in annular shape which does not result in functional MR probably due to the maintained elliptical and saddle shape. In LVD‐FMR the annulus is flat and posterior papillary muscle to midanterior annulus distance is much longer than the distance between the anterior papillary muscle and midanterior annulus, both resulting in a much larger tenting volume than in LVD‐noMR patients (lower left figure). The annulus is circular with antero‐posterior diameter being similar to intercommissural diameter (lower right figure). LVD‐noMR indicates left ventricle dysfunction without functional mitral regurgitation; LVD‐FMR, left ventricle dysfunction and functional mitral regurgitation.

### Superficial surgical landmarks for the frontal sinus [^a05ab693]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

There is a lack of reports in the literature that contain descriptions of superficial anatomical landmarks for the identification of the internally located frontal sinus. Neurosurgeons must often enter the cranium through the frontal bone and knowledge of the frontal sinus is essential to minimize complications.

Methods

Seventy adult cadaveric frontal sinuses were evaluated. Measurements included both the lateral and superior extent of the frontal sinus in reference to a midpupillary line, and the superior extent of the frontal sinus from the nasion. Frontal sinuses were found bilaterally in all specimens. The mean height of the frontal sinus superior to the nasion was 2.8 cm. In 71.4% and 74.3% of specimens the lateral extent of the frontal sinus was found to be medial to the left and right midpupillary line, respectively. Distances superior to a plane drawn through the supraorbital ridges at a midpupillary line included a mean of 2.5 mm for the left side and 1.8 mm for the right side.

Conclusions

Of 70 sinuses, none extended more than 5 mm lateral to a midpupillary line. At this same midpupillary line and at a plane drawn through the supraorbital ridges, the frontal sinus was never higher than 12 mm. Finally, in the midline the frontal sinus never reached more than 4 cm above the nasion. These measurements will assist surgeons who must manipulate the frontal bone.

### Shape of pulmonary artery Doppler flow profile and right ventricular hemodynamics in neonates [^b2f5ea0e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize pulmonary artery Doppler flow profile (PAFP) patterns among infants receiving care in neonatal intensive care units and to examine the association of PAFP patterns with pulmonary and right ventricular (RV) hemodynamics.

Study Design

This is a retrospective study at 2 tertiary intensive care units over 4 years that included neonates who demonstrated a complete tricuspid regurgitation envelope on targeted neonatal echocardiography. Separate personnel reviewed TNEs to characterize PAFP patterns, divide cohort into PAFP groups, and measure quantitative indices of RV hemodynamics (RV systolic pressure, pulmonary artery acceleration time and its ratio with RV ejection time, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and RV output), for intergroup comparisons.

Results

We evaluated TNEs from 186 neonates with median gestational age of 28.5 weeks (IQR, 25.9–35.9 weeks). Four distinct PAFP patterns were identified (A) near-isosceles triangle (22%), (B) right-angled triangle (29%), (C) notching (40%), and (D) low peak velocity (< 0.4 m/s; 9%). Groups A-C demonstrated a stepwise worsening in all indices of PH, whereas pattern D was associated with lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and RV output. Using common definitions of pulmonary hypertension (PH), pattern A performed best to rule out PH (sensitivity range, 81%-90%) and pattern C for diagnosing PH (specificity range, 63%-78%).

Conclusions

Inspection of PAFP is a simple bedside echocardiography measure that provides clinically meaningful information on underlying RV hemodynamics and may aid in screening and monitoring of patients for PH in intensive care units.

### Mosaic two-lengthscale quasicrystals [^2542b8e4]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Over the past decade, quasicrystalline order has been observed in many soft-matter systems: in dendritic micelles, in star and tetrablock terpolymer melts and in diblock copolymer and surfactant micelles. The formation of quasicrystals from such a broad range of 'soft' macromolecular micelles suggests that they assemble by a generic mechanism rather than being dependent on the specific chemistry of each system. Indeed, micellar softness has been postulated and shown to lead to quasicrystalline order. Here we theoretically explore this link by studying two-dimensional hard disks decorated with step-like square-shoulder repulsion that mimics, for example, the soft alkyl shell around the aromatic core in dendritic micelles. We find a family of quasicrystals with 10-, 12-, 18- and 24-fold bond orientational order which originate from mosaics of equilateral and isosceles triangles formed by particles arranged core-to-core and shoulder-to-shoulder. The pair interaction responsible for these phases highlights the role of local packing geometry in generating quasicrystallinity in soft matter, complementing the principles that lead to quasicrystal formation in hard tetrahedra. Based on simple interparticle potentials, quasicrystalline mosaics may well find use in diverse applications ranging from improved image reproduction to advanced photonic materials.

It should be noted that the 3D Modeling step does not model or image deep margins since the bottom of the tissue sits on the turntable, though this modeling step is entirely separate from the histological findings (which do model deep margins) and mapping those results to the surgical tumor map but may be integrated with the other two modules in future iterations.

Grossing Recommendations and Size Report in 3D Model Pane. The 3D tissue model is displayed using an interactive web application using the dash_vtk package along with exportable technical readouts on the tissue size measurements (3D Model Pane). ArcticAI features two grossing recommendation tools, one for Mohs and another for traditional excisions with breadloafing. For the Mohs configuration, a 3D line is drawn from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the web application. The 12 o'clock portion of the line is colored blue while the 6 o'clock portion is colored red. If the tissue is to be bisected, two pairs of blue-red lines are drawn parallel to a black line, which is drawn in the middle of the orientation lines. For breadloafing, the surgical excision is arranged such that the Burow's triangles/cones (i.e. superior/inferior or lateral/medial triangular excisions adjacent to resection used as a skin graft to repair surgical defects) point in the forward/backward ("positive/negative-y") direction. Colored lines are placed across the specimen in the side-to-side direction at regular 0.5 to 1-centimeter increments (or set by the user; based on distance to the center) to represent placement of the breadloaf section cuts. Lines to the left of the specimen are colored blue to maintain orientation, while lines to the right are colored red, yellow, green, purple and orange to denote unique sections. The tissue can be inked in accordance with grossing recommendations.

### Papillary reconstruction using three different modalities… [^5ac446a5]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Papillary Reconstruction Using Three Different ModalitiesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Interdental papilla is the component of gingiva which occupies the cervical embrasure between proximal surfaces of the teeth. It is triangular when observed two dimensionally and pyramidal when viewed three dimensionally. Its shape, position, and presence are dependent upon the presence of underlying alveolar bone proper, proximal contact points, and area of adjacent teeth. This entity is also known as the interdental papillary house by Gonzalez et al, where the dimensions of the roof, floor and lateral walls of the interdental house help in maintaining the interdental papilla. If there is any defect of alveolar bone proper or adjacent tooth contact, the IPD will fail to sustain its original form resulting in empty space between teeth.

This space is commonly referred as a black triangle or open gingival embrasure as a result of deficiency or loss of papilla beneath the contact points. This black triangle has many negative consequences as unpleasant appearance while smiling, food impaction and phonetic problems. Numerous risk factors lead to the development of this problem. These factors include aging, periodontal disease, loss of height of the alveolar bone relative to the interproximal contact, length of embrasure area, root angulations, tooth loss, faulty oral hygiene procedures, interproximal contact position, and triangular-shaped crowns. Modified Beagle's technique is another novel minimally invasive surgical approach for restoring lost IDP. The standard Beagle's technique includes partial thickness incision along the line angles of adjacent teeth on the palatal aspect then it's elevated and folded on the labial aspect.

So our technique is a variant of Beagle's technique to achieve soft tissue augmentation of anterior interproximal space, without requiring a second surgical site. It consists of a small pedicle flap elevated from labial side and folded upon itself. Furthermore, this procedure is less time-consuming and surgically more simple.

Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

Magnetic coil manufacturing

The T2-Bent-D63 magnetic core is no longer a single continuous core but was transformed into two T-shaped cores in lateral projection. This configuration facilitates adjusting the angle and reduces weight. The T-shaped magnetic cores were manufactured by connecting a small and a large thin cylinder at their centers. The small cylinder had a diameter of 4.6 cm and a height of 1 cm, while the large cylinder had a diameter of 7.8 cm and a height of 1.3 cm. The core material employed was alloy powder HiFlux 125 mu, a high-saturation, low-loss, high-flux core made of 50% nickel and 50% iron with distributed air gaps, achieving a saturation magnetic flux density of up to 1.5 T, with an initial permeability (μr) of 125.

The coil winding was done using rectangular litz wire with a cross-sectional dimension of 2.1 mm × 5 mm. The litz wire consisted of 171 individual enameled wires with a diameter of 0.2 mm, resulting in an effective cross-sectional area of 5.37 mm². The filling factor was about 50%. The coil has 14 turns on each side, an inner diameter of 4.8 cm, an outer diameter of 7.8 cm, and a thickness of 1 cm. Each circular coil on either side was wound directly onto the T-shaped magnetic core in two layers, with 7 turns per layer. Subsequently, the two coils on either side were welded to form a figure-8 coil. A 1.5 m long 10 AWG (6 mm²) connecting cable was soldered to the coils.

The coil and magnetic core were bonded and sealed using epoxy resin, forming a shell. Simple sealing molds were created using silicone gel. The curing process was accelerated by heating. Before complete curing, the coils were bent to the desired angle. At a thickness of approximately 2 mm from the coil to the shell surface, insulation strength and mechanical strength are ensured, reducing the distance between the coil and the scalp and enhancing stimulus intensity.

### Measurement of the maxilla and zygoma as an aid in installing zygomatic implants [^e35d7e05]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study used maxillary and zygomatic measurements to obtain information for installing zygomatic implants.

Patients and Methods

Angular and linear distances between the maxilla and the zygoma were measured in 12 cadavers (n = 22 sides) classified into short and tall groups by height (140 to 159 cm and 160 to 180 cm, respectively).

Results

Based on mean and standard deviation values, the installation angle of zygomatic implants was between 43.8 degrees and 50.6 degrees. The distance between the crest of the maxillary alveolar process near the palate and the jugale (Ju) point of the zygoma was between 44.3 and 54.3 mm. The minimum distance between the most lateral corner of the maxillary sinus and the Ju point was 6.41 mm, and the minimum anteroposterior length of the zygoma was 5.68 mm in the shorter group.

Conclusions

When the installation angle of zygomatic implants is 43.8 degrees or less, perforation of the maxilla and the zygoma or the infratemporal fossa must be avoided. When the angle is 50.6 degrees or more, perforation of the orbital floor must be avoided. Special attention is needed to ensure osseointegration in shorter patients, because the distance between the most lateral corner of the antrum supporting the zygomatic implant and the Ju point is 10 mm or less. The apex of the implant is 3.75 mm in diameter, and the thickness of the zygoma must be 5.75 mm or more. The threads of the implant must not be exposed from the zygoma in shorter patients.

### Effect of maternal positioning during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^fa164fc9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing guidelines and reviews

The 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines recommend that "priorities for the pregnant woman in cardiac arrest should include provision of high-quality CPR and relief of aortocaval compression through left-lateral uterine displacement" (Supplement, p. 454). This recommendation is based primarily on the physiology of pregnancy, extrapolations from the non-arrest pregnancy states and non-randomised simulation-based studies. However, the interpretation of the recommendation is not straightforward because the recommendation was based on inconsistent results, including the non-randomised simulation-based studies conducted 30 to 40 years ago.

One of the studies often utilised in clinical practice guidelines is Goodwin's non-randomised simulation-based study published in 1992. Goodwin found that chest compression quality was more reduced in the supine position than in the wedged position, using the human wedge manoeuvre. According to Goodwin, the common reason for inaccuracy is "compression of too great a force" (, p. 434), but the correct definition of cardiac compression and compression were not provided. Our systematic review revealed that findings from recent RCTs contradict Goodwin's findings, possibly because of changes in CPR recommendations in past decades. For example, the current CPR guidelines recommend a target chest compression depth of 5–6 cm, whereas it was 4–5 cm (AHA Guidelines 2005) in the past. Even further back, it was defined as the difference in the height of a rescuer's shoulder, not in a victim's chest, using 2.5–5 cm in the 1992 AHA Guidelines.

Although our review included only indirect evidence from simulation-based studies, the trials included had more sophisticated studies that overcome the methodological limitations commonly observed in previous studies (such as lack of randomisation, the potential risk of carryover effect and the inaccuracy of measuring outcomes). Our results showed that resuscitation in the supine position enhances the quality of the resuscitation activity. Together with evidence from previous systematic reviews on the non-arrest pregnant population that shows that manual left uterine displacement effectively relieves aortocaval pressure in pregnant women with hypotension, it is reasonable to conclude that manual left uterine displacement in the supine position is more effective than a left-lateral tilt position to increase the chest compression quality during resuscitation. This can, in turn, contribute to increased maternal and foetal survival rates following maternal cardiac arrest.

### Triple Z flap technique for reconstruction of triangular defects in problem areas [^0bd13204]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Reconstruction of defects close to important structures where standard flaps cannot easily be used may sometimes challenge surgeons. Classic reconstructive options for such defects close to problem areas may not always yield the best result.

Methods

The authors used the triple Z flap technique for triangular defects close to problem areas in 18 patients. The defects were triangular or close to triangular in shape, and three Z flaps were planned on each side of the defect. Flaps were transposed and the defects were reconstructed without any complications.

Results

The results were quite satisfying for both the patient and the surgeon. Neither retraction nor any distortion was observed.

Conclusion

The triple Z flap technique can be used in selected cases where local flap choices are scarce and it is difficult to achieve good anatomical and aesthetic results.

Fig. 2
Schematics of two boundary conditions (BCs): original BCs (Eq. (1)) and converted BCs (Eq. (2)).

M and S represent the random material distribution designs and corresponding actuated shapes, respectively. Using the original BCs, FE simulations are performed to generate the dataset, i.e. pairs of (M, S). The same BCs are then used to augment the dataset 16 times. Finally, the converted BCs are used to transform the generated dataset for the ML training. The quadrilateral AB'C'D' (red) is taken to be the corner element face that lies on the mid-surface.

Due to the large design space, a large amount of training data is needed. We create 56,250 random material distributions (or designs) of two types: 31,250 fully random designs and 25,000 island designs. The former is randomly generated without any pattern constraints, while the latter is obtained through certain combinations of random island images with connected domains of "1"s or "0"s (see "Methods" and Supplementary Fig. 1). The corresponding true actuated shapes are then obtained through FE simulations (Fig. 2). As a result, the generated datasets are pairs of material distribution M and actuated shape S in terms of coordinates of sampling points. Owing to the symmetries in the geometry, each simulation data can be augmented to 16 non-repeating data with flipped and/or transposed material distribution designs (Supplementary Fig. 2), whose actuated shapes can be calculated using symmetric rules without need for new simulations. As the original BCs allow for simple calculation of the new shape changes, the dataset is augmented first based on the original BCs and then converted to the other set of BCs. After 56,250 FE simulations and data augmentation, the size of the entire dataset is 900,000, which is split into training and validation datasets with fractions of 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. As detailed in "Methods", statistics investigations of the dataset are performed, and the results show that the island dataset overall exhibits larger displacements (mean value of maximum displacement: 33.0 mm) than that of the fully random dataset (mean value of maximum displacement: 8.4 mm) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b); the training and validation datasets follow similar distributions (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The data is then used to train the ML model, which will be constructed below.

### Choosing the correct length of ureteric stent: a formula based on the patient's height compared with direct ureteric measurement [^fe251cc8]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate a formula based on the patient's height for choosing the correct length of ureteric stent and to compare its accuracy with that of direct ureteric length measurement.

Methods

Thirty-five patients (41 ureters) with ureteric obstruction were prospectively studied. All received Percuflex 8F double pigtail ureteric stents. Stent lengths were chosen according to patient height: < 5 ft 10 in (< 178 cm) = 22 cm; 5 ft 10 in to 6 ft 4 in (178–193 cm) = 24 cm; > 6 ft 4 in (> 193 cm) = 26 cm. The final stent position was graded using a 5-point scale (0 representing ideal length, with -2 and +2 being too short and too long respectively). Stent length acceptability using direct ureteric measurement was then estimated using the same 5-point scale; and the results compared.

Results

Patient's height correctly predicted stent length in the majority of ureters (grade 0 = 61%), with no stent being too short. In comparison, direct ureteric measurement oversized the stent in 83%, correctly predicting stent length in only 17%.

Conclusion

Patient's height is a more reliable guide to ureteric stent length than direct ureteric measurement, particularly in the dilated and tortuous ureter. This may be because the redundant ureter is capable of significant shortening under the influence of the ureteric stent.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fdf07696]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing disease (CD) transsphenoidal surgery — We recommend TSS by an experienced pituitary surgeon as the optimal treatment for CD in pediatric and adult patients. These tumors are typically benign microadenomas (< 1 cm diameter) and are evident on pituitary MRI in approximately 60% of adults and approximately 55% of children; however, 10% of healthy adults have pituitary lesions ≤ 6 mm that are visible on MRI and there is a 12% rate of abnormal pituitary MRI scans in patients with EAS and a 12% rate of false localization by MRI in patients with surgically proven CD. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling does not reliably identify the tumor site because a side-to-side gradient of > 1.4 correctly predicted location in only 56–69% of adults and 59–81% of children, and hemi-hypophysectomy based on such lateralization cured only 50% of patients in one study.

### Infraspinatus and deltoid length and patient height: implications for lateralization and distalization in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [^280b1035]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Restoration of muscular strength is predicated on restoration of muscle length. The purpose of this study was to describe infraspinatus and deltoid length preoperative to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) to guide distalization and lateralization to restore preoperative muscle length.

Methods

This was a retrospective radiographic study. We measured the infraspinatus length on preoperative computed tomographic images and the deltoid length on preoperative radiographs. For all measurements, reliability was first established by comparing measurements between 2 observers, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. We then calculated descriptive statistics for these muscle lengths and developed a formula to predict these muscle lengths from patient demographics.

Results

We measured infraspinatus length in 97 patients and deltoid length in 108 patients. Inter-rater reliability was excellent, with all ICCs > 0.886. The mean infraspinatus length was 15.5 cm (standard deviation 1.3) and ranged from 12.6–18.9 cm, whereas the deltoid length was 16.2 ± 1.7 cm and ranged from 12.5–20.2 cm. Both infraspinatus (r = 0.775, P < .001) and deltoid length (r = 0.717, P < .001) were highly correlated with patient height but did not differ between diagnoses. Formulae developed through linear regression allowed prediction of muscle length to within 1 cm in 78% and within 2 cm in 100% for the infraspinatus and 60% and 88% for the deltoid.

Conclusion

Deltoid and infraspinatus length are variable but highly correlated with patient height. To maintain tension, 2 mm of lateralization and distalization should be added for every 6 inches (∼15 cm) of height above average for a Grammont-style RTSA.

### Adjustment of the endoscopic third ventriculostomy entry point based on the anatomical relationship between coronal and sagittal sutures [^5e47d3bb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

The coronal suture is often used as an empirical landmark for the entry point for endoscopic third ventriculostomy. The trajectory for the approach is often drawn based on midsagittal MRI findings. However, because the coronal suture is not perpendicular to the midline, this method may be inaccurate.

Methods

The junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures was exposed at the outer table of the cranium of 15 cadavers. An ideal coronal line was established perpendicular to the sagittal suture at the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures. The distance from this ideal coronal line at the level of the coronal-sagittal junction to the actual coronal suture was measured at 1-cm intervals. The measured distance between the 2 planes was termed the distance to the coronal suture.

Results

The coronal suture bows forward as it moves from medial to lateral. From 1–6 cm lateral to the sagittal suture, the distance to the coronal suture was 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.4 cm, respectively. There was no significant difference between the right and left sides.

Conclusions

The position of a bur hole for endoscopic third ventriculostomy should be moved posteriorly with respect to the coronal suture the more laterally it is placed. Although the adjustment is small, it may be crucial. Failure to make this adjustment may result in suboptimal bur hole placement and increase the risk of morbidity.

### Anatomy of subaxial cervical foramens: the safety zone for lateral mass screwing [^1ac50197]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to measure the structures of the ventral of lateral masses using cadaver specimens and to quantitatively compare the safety zone for the two major techniques used on each vertebral level from C3 to C6.

Methods

This study is based on 52 cervical vertebrae of 13 cadavers. The anatomical measurements focused on the anterior surface of the lateral mass. We investigated the safety width, heights, and the height of nerve roots.

Results

The mean values of the safety width of the Magerl technique from C3 to C6 were 6.1, 7.3, 6.4 and 4.3 mm, respectively. The mean values of the safety width of the Roy-Camille technique were 6.7, 6.6, 5.8 and 5.4 mm, respectively. The mean values of the safety height of the Magerl technique were 5.0, 5.4, 5.8 and 5.2 mm, respectively. The mean values of the safety height of the Roy-Camille technique were 4.9, 4.0, 1.0 and -1.2 mm, respectively. The mean values of the nerve root height were 3.9, 4.9, 5.9 and 6.9 mm, respectively.

Conclusion

The safety width of the Magerl technique was shorter at C6 because the vertebral artery runs more laterally at C6. The height for the Magerl technique was not significantly different from C3 to C6, however, the safety height for the Roy-Camille technique was significantly shorter at C5 and C6. Our findings suggest that it is important to ensure that the screw(s) penetrate through the cranial side of the ventral aspect of a lateral mass when performing the Magerl technique at all vertebral levels, and to carefully select the screw length when using the Roy-Camille technique, especially at C5 and C6, in order to avoid nerve root injury.

For simultaneous treatment with lateral canthal lines, the total dose is 64 Units, comprised of 20 Units for forehead lines, 20 Units for glabellar lines, and 24 Units for lateral canthal lines (see Lateral Canthal Lines Administration and Figures 2 and 3).

Platysma Bands

Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle, and aseptic technique, inject 2 Units (0.05 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 4 sites in the upper segment of platysma muscle, below the jawline on each side. For each side, administer the 4 jawline injections to the upper platysma muscle approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior and parallel to the lower mandibular border. Ensure the anterior injection site is in line with the oral commissure, and the posterior injection is slightly anterior to the angle of the mandible. Administer the remaining 2 injections equidistant (approximately 1 to 2 cm apart) between the anterior and posterior injection points (see Figures 5 and 6).

In addition, inject 1 Unit (0.025 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 5 sites along each vertical neck band, 1 to 2 vertical neck bands per side. For each vertical neck band identified, 1 to 2 per side, distribute 5 injections vertically approximately 1 to 2 cm apart (see Figures 5 and 6). Ensure the most superior injection site is approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior to the jawline injections.

Depending on platysma band severity, the total dose may be 26 Units (1 band/side), 31 Units (1 band one side, 2 bands other side), or 36 Units (2 bands/side) (see Table 4 and Figures 5 and 6 below).

Administer all platysma muscle injections superficially and intramuscularly with the needle perpendicular to the surface of the skin. For vertical neck band injections, identify each band while the patient is contracting their platysma. Gently pinch the band to isolate the muscle from nearby anatomical structures during administration (see Table 4).

To reduce injection-related complications, administer injection at least 1 cm inferior to the lower mandibular border. Do not inject into structures deep to the platysma muscle, particularly in the anterior region of the neck.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^b6b1dccf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Patient details for spirometry — recording and measurement standards: The patient's age, height, and weight (wearing indoor clothes and without shoes) are recorded, and it is preferable to calculate age using the date of birth and the date of the test; age must be reported in years to one decimal place. Height in centimeters to one decimal place and weight to the nearest 0.5 kg must be recorded; these may be expressed in inches and pounds on reports in jurisdictions still using those measures. Body mass index should be calculated as kg/m2. Height must be measured without shoes, with the feet together, standing as tall as possible with the eyes level and looking straight ahead, and the back flush against a wall or stadiometer. For patients unable to stand erect, height may be estimated using ulna length (preferred for children) or arm span, and ulna length should be measured with calipers to avoid error introduced using a tape measure. In persons aged 25 years or older with a reliable previous height in the same facility, remeasuring height at subsequent visits within 1 year may not be necessary. Birth sex and ethnicity should be included in the patient information on the spirometry request.

### AGA clinical practice update on nonampullary duodenal lesions: expert review [^ca8db600]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Nonampullary duodenal lesions — scope choice, localization, and biopsy considerations: Confirmation that the lesion is not adjacent to or involving the major papilla is critical before polypectomy. For lesions located on the medial wall and within 5 cm of the papilla, a duodenoscope should be used, whereas for lesions located on the posterior/lateral wall and distal duodenum, a pediatric colonoscope may be useful for the additional insertion length and the favorable 5- to 6-o'clock orientation of the working channel. Duodenal tattoo injection is not required, and caution is advised with duodenal biopsies if future resection is likely, as it can result in underlying fibrosis leading to increased difficulties and risks at the time of resection.

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^f9ada43c]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

To simplify the measurement of the hemicraniectomy diameter on postoperative imaging data, the bone flap was considered as an ellipse oriented in sagittal axis (see Fig. 1): First, the image showing the largest diameter of the bone flap in the axial plane was selected and aligned along the sagittal axis (larger axis = major). Second, the same procedure was performed in the coronal plane to define the smaller axis (minor). Subsequently, the ellipse was rotated in the sagittal plane to obtain the minor and major axes directly from coronal and axial coordinates (Fig. 1). The diameter of the hemicraniectomy was defined as the length (L) of the ellipse´s major axis, while height (H) was defined as the ellipse´s smaller axis (minor). Surface area (A) of the hemicraniectomy was calculated using the two perpendicular parameters and the following formula: A = [L/2] × [H/2] × π.

Fig. 1
Non-contrast computed tomography CT scan in representative slices after alignment (rotation angles ϕ 1, ϕ 2, ϕ 3) of the trephination hole: A "sagittal" slice aligned with the trephination hole as an ellipse for calculation of the surface area (light blue); B "coronal" slice with the height of the minor axis (H, green); C "axial" slice with the major axis defining the "diameter" of the hemicraniectomy (L, red)

All patients were dichotomized in two groups based on the diameter of the bone flap according to the larger major axis defining diameter ≤ 14 cm as "standard hemicraniectomy" (HC ≤ 14) and > 14 cm as "large hemicraniectomy" (HC > 14). Additionally, amount of midline shift and involvement of anterior/posterior cerebral artery territory, and uncal herniation at study inclusion were assessed on pre-operative neuroimaging.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^6acc0d60]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Seven studies (one nonrandomised controlled trial, five cohort studies and a case-control study) demonstrated that weight loss has benefits for controlling reflux-like symptoms and discontinuation of PPI. The population-based nord-trøndelag health study study demonstrated a dose-dependent association between weight loss and reduced reflux-like symptoms (P value for trend P < 0.001), with the odds of symptom loss increasing four-fold (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 2.03–7.65) in participants on medication who achieved a decrease in BMI of > 3.5 units versus < 0.5 units.

Statement 11: Head-of-the-bed elevation should be recommended to individuals with night-time reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 100% (6, 72.7%; 5, 27.2%; grade of evidence: C; strength of recommendation: high).

Five systematic reviews and five studies (two randomised crossover two before-after and one cross-sectional) concluded that head-of-the-bed elevation may reduce oesophageal acid exposure and reflux-like symptoms. Methods used to raise the head-of-the-bed included wooden blocks (20 cm), a 20 cm height/20-degree foam wedge pillow and a positional device (elevating the head/torso to 15 to 20 degrees together with maintaining left-side positioning).

Statement 12: Sleeping in the left lateral decubitus position should be recommended to individuals with night-time reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 81.8% (6, 27.2%; 5, 54.6%; grade of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate).

### Precise sizing of aortic valvular leaflet reconstruction using 4-dimensional computerized tomography: a personalized approach [^aa6022d5]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An 18-year-old man presented with severe aortic regurgitation (AR), left ventricular dilation, and functional BAV with fusion between the coronary leaflets and trisinuate AoR. A 4D computed tomography scan demonstrated fused coronary leaflets with very asymmetric commissural position (135°) favoring a tricuspidization approach. There was moderate annular (3.8 × 3.0 cm), mild root (3.7 cm), and mild sinotubular junction dilation (3.4 cm). The intercoronary commissural height was hypoplastic (11 mm) compared with the 2 normal commissures (22–23 mm). The free margin length for left and right leaflets was 38 and 43 mm, respectively (Figure 1). A tailored butterfly patch extension of both leaflets with height of 12 mm at the base was made to elevate commissural height to match normal commissures. The length was equivalent to the free margin length of the coronary leaflets (Figure 2). Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed these findings, revealing an additional regurgitation jet at left and noncoronary leaflet commissure related to commissural malalignment (Figure E1).

### Cancer phenotype as the outcome of an evolutionary game between normal and malignant cells [^4332d162]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Our analysis is based on the replicator equation describing the frequency dependent evolutionary dynamics of three well-mixed cell populations. Consequently, we assume that (i) no new mutations occur during tumour dynamics except those which initiated the tumour and (ii) deterministic cell population dynamics. Although the first issue is often justified, cell dynamics often reflects a stochastic behaviour which may lead to additional disease variability not captured at this level of description. The generation of the first MM cell is a multistep process requiring a series of mutations that transform a normal plasma cell into an MM cell. We start our dynamics assuming that this first MM is present and follow its clonal expansion.

Tumour dynamics is conveniently represented in the simplex (an equilateral triangle for three strategies) at every point of which we have the relative frequencies of OB, OC and MM populations that sum up to 1. Let us denote by x i (t) the relative frequencies of the cell-types: x 1 (t) (OC cells), x 2 (t) (OB cells) and x 3 (t) (MM cells). The replicator equations readwhere the fitness of each cell type is given in terms of a game payoff matrix A ij bywhereas the average fitness of the population reads

### Tractography-based ventral intermediate nucleus targeting: novel methodology and intraoperative validation [^963b3974]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Determination of the T‐VIM and Its Structural Connections

Anatomically PT and ML, respectively, represent the lateral and the posterior ventral boundaries of the VIM thalamus. To delineate the T‐VIM, the images were aligned in the anterior commissural (AC)‐posterior commissural (PC) plane and an axial slice at the AC‐PC level was selected. We placed a cubic thalamic ROI (length 4.6 [0.4] mm, width 3.8 [0.5] mm, height 5.4 [0.6] mm, volume 93.5 [15] mm 3) with its center equidistant (3 mm) from the borders of the PT and ML (Fig. 1). The distance of 3 mm was deemed a clinically safe margin to avoid motor and sensory side effects associated with either lesioning or DBS. The tracking parameters were the same for the PT and ML, with a tracking angle of 60 0. Finally, tractography was performed to explore the structural connections of T‐VIM.

### A prospective study validating a clinical scoring system and demonstrating phenotypical-genotypical correlations in silver-russell syndrome [^8e32f138]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical score

Our new scoring system, the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system (NH-CSS), is based on the original system developed by Netchine et al and no longer includes a requirement for SGA (see online supplementary table S1 and scoring system sheet). Six factors are included in the NH-CSS: (1) prenatal growth retardation (birth weight and/or length ≤ −2 standard deviation score (SDS) for gestational age); (2) postnatal growth retardation (height at 24 ± 1 months ≤ −2 SDS according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts or height ≤ −2 SDS from midparental target height); (3) relative macrocephaly at birth (head circumference at birth at least 1.5 SDS above birth weight and/or length SDS according to Usher and McLean statistical data);(4) protruding forehead (defined as a forehead that projects beyond the facial plane on a side view as depicted on figure 1) as a toddler; (5) body asymmetry (defined as a leg length discrepancy (LLD) of ≥ 0.5 cm or arm asymmetry or LLD < 0.5 cm with at least two other asymmetrical body parts (with one being a non-face part)); (6) feeding difficulties (use of a feeding tube or cyproheptadine for appetite stimulation) and/or low BMI (BMI ≤ −2 SDS at 24 months) according to CDC growth charts. Midparental target height was calculated as follows: ((father's height+mother's height)/2)+6.5 cm for boys and −6.5 cm for girls.

### The anterior inferior iliac spine: size, position, and location. An anthropometric and sex survey [^c782f70a]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the size, location, and position of the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) in normal individuals.

Methods

We reviewed 50 computed tomography (CT) scans of 50 patients without hip pain or pathologic features. Mean patient height was 169.8 cm (women, 163 cm; men, 176.8 cm) and mean weight was 69.6 kg (women, 63.8 kg; men, 75.4 kg). We used all scans to measure both the left and right AIIS for the anatomic description of 100 AIISs. We measured AIIS dimensions, specifically length, width, and height. We also measured vertical, horizontal, and straight distances between the most anteroinferior prominence of the AIIS and the acetabular rim. We normalized AIIS size and distances from the acetabular rim according to the patient's height and body mass index (BMI). We also assessed the version of the AIIS using 2 angles. The first angle was the angle between the AIIS midaxis line and a plumb line, and the second angle was calculated as the angle subtended by the AIIS midaxis line and the ilium midaxis line.

Results

There were no significant differences between the AIIS in men and women in all measurements (except the width of the AIIS) when normalized to the patient's height and BMI. There were no significant differences in AIIS dimensions when comparing side-to-side differences in the entire study population.

Conclusions

In quantifying AIIS dimensional size, distance from the anterior acetabular rim, and version, this study found no significant difference in all measurements normalized to patient size (height and BMI) between the left and right sides, and no significant sex difference was found in AIIS measurements, except the width of the AIIS.

Clinical Relevance

Morphologic variations that deviate from these normal values may help the clinician identify cases of subspinal impingement.

### Vascular geometry of the extracranial carotid arteries: an analysis of length, diameter, and tortuosity [^c64f228a]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Stable access is essential for successful intracranial interventions. Quantifying variations in extracranial carotid arteries may help in the selection and development of access catheters. This study describes the vascular dimensions from the aortic arch to the skull base.

Methods

CT angiography analysis was performed on 100 patients. The lengths, diameters, and tortuosity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured from the aortic arch to the skull base.

Results

The mean ± SD length of the carotid artery from the aortic arch to the skull base was 22.2 ± 2.2 cm for the right side and 20.8 ± 1.9 cm for the left side (p < 0.0001). The length of the right CCA was 13.6 ± 1.2 cm and the length of the left CCA was 12.4 ± 1.4 cm (p < 0.0001). The length of the right ICA was 8.6 ± 1.4 cm compared with 8.4 ± 1.4 cm for the left ICA (p = 0.3). The ICA length in men and women was 8.9 ± 1.3 cm and 8.2 ± 1.3 cm, respectively (p = 0.0001), and the CCA length in men and women was 13.6 ± 1.5 cm and 12.3 ± 1.6 cm, respectively (p < 0.0001). The lengths of the CCA and ICA in patients aged ≥ 60years were 13.3 ± 1.7 cm and 8.9 ± 1.5 cm, respectively compared with 12.8 ± 1.7 cm and 8.2 ± 1.1 cm, respectively, for patients aged < 60years (p = 0.04 for CCA, p = 0.0002 for ICA). Tortuosity of the CCA and ICA was 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.3 ± 0.1, respectively, in patients aged ≥ 60years compared with 1.1 ± 0.1 for both the ICA and CCA in patients aged < 60years (p < 0.0001 for both). There was a consistent ratio of CCA/ICA length of 1.6 ± 0.3 on the right and 1.5 ± 0.3 on the left (p < 0.0001). The arterial diameters did not show any significant difference.

Conclusions

The distance from the aortic arch to the skull base is longer on the right than on the left side. Both the CCA and ICA are longer in men and in patients aged ≥ 60years. The tortuosity of both segments significantly increases with age.

### L-brachioplasty: an adaptable technique for moderate to severe excess skin and fat of the arms [^c6d84acc]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The L-brachioplasty is an L-shaped pattern of excision with the long limb from the elbow to the axilla and the short limb extending at right angles through the axilla and along the lateral chest. The width of the excisions through the arm, axilla and chest is based on preoperative assessment through anatomical point locations followed by pinch and gathering maneuvers. The following modifications have improved aesthetics and reduced complications: 1) improved geometric design, 2) anchor fixation of the posterior V-shaped advancement flap to the deltopectoral fascia, 3) excision site liposuction (ESL), and 4) and barbed suture closure. The free hand markings are followed by measuring equal anterior and posterior incision distances. The subcutaneous fat within the excision site is completely suctioned. After the perimeter is incised, the skin resection begins full thickness from the chest and through the axilla and then the skin only through proximal to distal arm skin. An anchor suture advances the posterior triangular flap to the deltopectoral fascia. A long-lasting absorbable barbed suture is passed through as a running horizontal mattress, starting from the center of the wound. A second continuous rapidly absorbing barbed intradermal suture completes the closure. Over the past 30 arms, only one seroma was aspirated on one occasion. There have been no lymphoceles. Appreciable swelling is over within a month. Incision dehiscence was limited to less than one centimeter in five patients. Tip necrosis of the V advancement flap occurred in three arms, leaving small wounds in the axilla to heal secondarily. Minor secondary skin reduction is rare. There were no contractures across the axilla. The women appreciated the reduced hair and axillary hollow. In most cases the skin laxity was corrected and the contour from the arm across the axilla to the lateral chest was excellent. No patient expressed regret over their scar.

### Unilateral cleft nasal deformity correction using conchal cartilage lily flower graft [^fc383d8f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

We present a conchal cartilage lily flower graft for correcting depressed and laterally displaced alar cartilage for correction of unilateral cleft nasal deformity. After making a V incision at the base of the columellar and then marginal incisions, the alar cartilages were exposed. A fusiform-shaped cartilage larger than 2.5 cm in length and 1 cm in width was obtained. The midline long axis was scored with a No. 15 knife, and the lateral one third was split. Two-thirds length portions were folded in half, and they became straightened in the shape of a stalk of a lily flower. Two symmetrical one-third length portions were fanned out bilaterally in the shape of the leaf of a lily flower. The stalk portion was positioned in a pocket between the medial crura, and the 2 leaf portions were placed on the dome of the alar cartilages. The marked points of the cleft side and contralateral side were secured with sutures. The V incision at the base of the columellar and the marginal incisions were closed with a V-Y shape. In this technique, the 2 leaf portions were placed on the dome of the alar cartilages and sutured; therefore, the suture holds the dome of the cleft side to the contralateral side without peaking. Thirteen patients (6 male and 7 female subjects; age range, 13–30 years) were operated. Among them, 6 patients were very satisfied, and 5 patients were satisfied with the results. Two patients felt they were improved. We think the conchal cartilage lily flower graft might be a good method for correction of depressed and laterally displaced alar cartilage in unilateral cleft nasal deformity.

### Endoscopic transorbital approach to the middle fossa: qualitative and quantitative anatomic study [^17c2a819]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The endoscopic superior eyelid transorbital route to the skull base is gaining progressive popularity in the neurosurgical community.

Objective

To evaluate the anatomy of the middle cranial fossa from this novel ventral perspective to reach the skull base through the transorbital route and to show limits for possible safe middle fossa drilling from the transorbital route.

Methods

Anatomic study was performed; 5 cadaveric specimens (ie, 10 sides) and 2 dry skulls (ie, 4 sides) were dissected.

Results

To obtain a functional result, there are boundaries that correspond to neurovascular structures that traverse, enter, or leave the middle fossa that must be respected: inferiorly, the lateral pterygoid muscle; medially, the Gasserian ganglion and the lateral border of the foramen rotundum; laterally, the foramen spinosum with the middle meningeal artery; superiorly, the lesser sphenoid wing; posteriorly, the anterior border of the foramen ovale. Average bone resected was 6.49 ± 0.80 cm3 which is the 63% of total middle fossa floor. The mean axial surgical length calculated was 3.85 cm (3.18–5.19 cm) while the mean sagittal surgical length was 5.23 cm (4.87–6.55 cm). The mean horizontal angle of approach was 38.14° (32.87°-45.63°), while the mean vertical angle of approach was 18.56° (10.81°-26.76°).

Conclusion

Detailed anatomy of the middle cranial fossa is presented, and herewith we demonstrated that from the endoscopic superior eyelid transorbital approach removal of middle cranial fossa floor is possible when anatomic landmarks are respected.

### Morphological changes in rectus abdominis muscle associated with pregnancy and abdominoplasty [^8f59f226]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Operative Technique

Double Folds of the Rectus Abdominis

Following the completion of the abdominal wall flap dissection, methylene blue was applied to delineate the medial border of the rectus abdominis muscle, corresponding to the outer edge of the linea alba (referred to as line 1). To facilitate the restoration of the rectus abdominis muscle to its prepregnancy condition as much as possible, it is recommended that a reinforcement line (designated as line 2) be drawn on the lateral side of line 1 (based on preoperative CT measurement data). When the mean width of the rectus abdominis muscle is less than 6 cm, the reinforcement line should be positioned 0.5 cm lateral to line 1. If the mean width of the rectus abdominis muscle is 6 cm or greater, the reinforcement line should be placed 1 cm lateral to line 1.

Suturing the First Layer

A continuous suture of line 1 with a No. 0 PDS loop (absorbable suture) was performed to tighten and align the medial border of the rectus abdominis. First, a continuous suture was started from the upper edge of the umbilical stalk to the unseparated part of the subxiphoid rectus abdominis, the rectus abdominis was then tightened, and the knots were buried deep. In the same manner, a continuous suture on line 1 was placed inferiorly from the lower edge of the umbilical stalk to the unseparated site of the rectus abdominis on the pubic symphysis.

Suturing the Second Layer

An interrupted suture with No. 2 nonabsorbable suture was used to tighten line 2 on both sides (3–4 stitches above/below navel). All sutures were tightened and the knots were buried deep. In this way, a hole with a diameter of about 1.5 to 2 cm was preserved at the umbilicus for the passage of the umbilical stalk, while also maintaining a deep position of the umbilical stalk and facilitating remodeling of the abdominal contour. See Video for details.
