## Question

Can Latuda be used to treat irritability?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Latuda (lurasidone) can be used to treat irritability. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indication and whether it includes irritability as a target symptom. Then, I should verify any recognized off-label uses that might encompass irritability. Next, I will review guideline-based treatments for irritability across conditions where it is a key symptom. After that, I need to consider lurasidone's pharmacology and adverse effect profile in relation to irritability. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation, including condition-specific alternatives and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the labeled uses and scope of lurasidone so I don't anchor on assumptions too early. Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic approved for schizophrenia in adults and for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults, as monotherapy or adjunctive to lithium or valproate, with typical dosing ranges of 40–160 mg/day for schizophrenia and 20–120 mg/day for bipolar depression, and there is no FDA-labeled indication for "irritability" per se [^116zWZzS] [^115SjZZs] [^115eVA5H].

> Wait, let me verify whether any credible sources list off-label use of lurasidone for irritability. Some drug information listings mention off-label use in major depressive disorder or schizoaffective disorder, and there are randomized data supporting efficacy in MDD with mixed features, but none of these constitute an off-label listing or evidentiary basis for treating irritability as a primary target, and I should not conflate improvement in depressive or mixed symptoms with an anti-irritability indication without direct data [^111KtMyp] [^111GQsTW] [^115zyh17].

> Next, I should review the evidence and guidelines for irritability itself across conditions to see if lurasidone appears anywhere. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in autism spectrum disorder, high-quality guidance consistently recommends risperidone and aripiprazole for clinically significant irritability, not lurasidone, and aripiprazole's efficacy is supported by Cochrane reviews, while risperidone carries an FDA indication for irritability in ASD with specific pediatric dosing ranges, none of which mention lurasidone as a therapeutic option for irritability [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM] [^112hAqTV] [^116tW6oo] [^113iqRsq] [^111M5xqB] [^114R8FhC].

> I will now examine irritability treatment outside ASD to ensure I'm not missing a niche role for lurasidone. In Huntington's disease, European Huntington's Disease Network guidance recommends SSRIs first-line for irritability, considering mirtazapine or mianserin combinations if needed, without any role for lurasidone, and emphasizes evaluating iatrogenic akathisia as a driver of agitation or irritability, which antipsychotics can precipitate [^117JihW3] [^111o4Uta] [^112qCe7u]. In ADHD-related irritability, rigorous analyses of the MTA data show stimulant-based pharmacotherapy improves irritability, with combined treatment sometimes advantageous, again with no lurasidone role identified [^116T7Eq6] [^115CW1BS].

> But wait, what if irritability is conceptualized transdiagnostically and antipsychotics as a class help, could that implicitly include lurasidone. Let me consider the meta-analytic picture more carefully. Systematic review and meta-analysis indicate antipsychotics are among the most effective pharmacologic options for persistent nonepisodic irritability in youth, with especially large effects in ASD; however, those data are largely driven by risperidone and aripiprazole trials, and I should not generalize that class effect to lurasidone without direct supportive trials or guideline endorsements naming it for irritability [^112QRa49] [^114hMvKh]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a class-wide rationale to extend to lurasidone, but the absence of lurasidone trials or recommendations for irritability specifically weakens that extrapolation, so I should correct that line of reasoning and avoid overgeneralization [^112QRa49].

> I need to check lurasidone's pharmacologic profile to see if there's a compelling mechanistic rationale uniquely suited to irritability. Lurasidone is a D₂ and 5-HT₂A antagonist with 5-HT₇ antagonism and 5-HT₁A partial agonism, a profile relevant to antipsychotic and antidepressant effects, but there is no established mechanistic or clinical link demonstrating selective efficacy for primary irritability symptoms independent of treating a defined underlying disorder, which contrasts with the direct evidence base for risperidone and aripiprazole in ASD-related irritability [^114nqct5] [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM].

> Hold on, I should verify adverse effects that could confound irritability management. Lurasidone commonly causes akathisia and other extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and nausea, and EPS/akathisia risk is comparatively higher among several SGAs including lurasidone, which can clinically present as inner restlessness and apparent irritability or agitation, potentially worsening the very symptom one is trying to treat if the etiologic driver is pharmacologic akathisia rather than a primary behavioral syndrome [^111ePkak] [^115R7xq6] [^117Vzyec]. I should double-check that "irritability" itself is not a listed adverse reaction on the SPLs provided, and I do not see it explicitly enumerated among common reactions, though related phenomena such as agitation and anxiety are listed, keeping the clinical differential in mind when irritability appears after antipsychotic initiation or dose increases [^111ePkak] [^115R7xq6].

> Let me synthesize and ensure the conclusion aligns with the totality of evidence. There is no FDA-labeled indication for lurasidone to treat irritability, no documented off-label consensus or trials specifically targeting irritability, and no guideline endorsing lurasidone for irritability across ASD, Huntington's disease, ADHD, or other conditions where irritability is a core target, whereas robust evidence and guidance support risperidone and aripiprazole in ASD, SSRIs in Huntington's disease, and stimulant-based regimens in ADHD for irritability reduction, so using lurasidone for "irritability" per se is not supported and may risk akathisia-related worsening in some cases [^116zWZzS] [^115SjZZs] [^115eVA5H] [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM] [^117JihW3] [^111o4Uta] [^116T7Eq6] [^115CW1BS] [^117Vzyec].

> Before finalizing, I should confirm practical, condition-specific next steps so clinicians have actionable alternatives. For ASD with moderate to severe irritability after behavioral interventions, consider risperidone or aripiprazole with appropriate pediatric dosing and monitoring, leveraging the robust ASD evidence base, and continue to prioritize functional behavioral assessment and parent training as part of a multimodal plan; for ADHD with prominent irritability, optimize stimulant therapy and consider combined behavioral treatment; for Huntington's disease, prioritize SSRIs and address iatrogenic akathisia, reserving other agents as guided by specialty protocols, always reassessing for medical, psychiatric, and environmental drivers of irritability before adding antipsychotics and closely monitoring for EPS and activation if any SGA is used [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM] [^112hAqTV] [^116tW6oo] [^113iqRsq] [^111M5xqB] [^114R8FhC] [^1159tE8e] [^112g5gHt] [^116T7Eq6] [^115CW1BS] [^117JihW3] [^111o4Uta] [^112qCe7u] [^112QRa49].

> Final clinical position: No, Latuda (lurasidone) should not be used to treat irritability as a primary symptom target, given the absence of an FDA indication, lack of supportive trials or guideline endorsements for this purpose, and the availability of condition-specific, evidence-based alternatives; if lurasidone is being used for its approved indications and irritability improves as part of global mood or psychotic symptom reduction, that is distinct from using it to treat irritability itself, and clinicians should remain vigilant for akathisia masquerading as irritability if lurasidone is initiated or up-titrated [^116zWZzS] [^115SjZZs] [^115eVA5H] [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM] [^112QRa49] [^117Vzyec] [^111ePkak] [^115R7xq6].

---

Latuda (lurasidone) is **not FDA-approved for irritability** [^111KtMyp] in any condition, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or dementia-related agitation. It is **approved for schizophrenia and bipolar depression** [^111KtMyp], where it may indirectly reduce irritability as part of overall symptom improvement. For irritability in ASD, risperidone [^113iqRsq] and aripiprazole [^112hAqTV] are **first-line, evidence-based options** [^111unrnh]. Lurasidone is generally well tolerated with minimal metabolic effects [^116cff4B], but akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms can occur [^111ePkak]. Use lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, and monitor closely for side effects.

---

## Clinical evidence for lurasidone in irritability

### Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

- **FDA approval**: Lurasidone is not approved [^111KtMyp] for irritability in ASD.

- **Clinical trials**: No published RCTs support lurasidone for irritability in ASD.

- **Guidelines**: Risperidone and aripiprazole [^112hAqTV] are first-line for irritability in ASD after behavioral interventions fail [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM].

---

### Dementia-related agitation

- **FDA approval**: Lurasidone [^111KtMyp] is not approved for agitation or irritability in dementia.

- **Clinical evidence**: No RCTs support lurasidone for irritability in dementia.

- **Guidelines**: Atypical antipsychotics are generally avoided [^117VrDS6] in dementia due to increased mortality and stroke risk [^117LCQVH].

---

### Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia

In bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, lurasidone is **FDA-approved** for schizophrenia and bipolar depression [^111KtMyp]. Evidence indicates it may indirectly reduce irritability as overall symptoms improve [^113AtcCp], but it is **not specifically indicated for irritability**.

---

## Safety and tolerability profile

Lurasidone is generally well tolerated, with **minimal metabolic effects** compared with other antipsychotics [^116wiGQn]. Notable **adverse effects** include:

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Akathisia | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Somnolence | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Nausea | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Weight gain | Very common (> 10%) [^111ePkak] |
| Hyperprolactinemia | Common (1–10%) [^115R7xq6] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | Common (1–10%) [^115R7xq6] |

---

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

Compared with other antipsychotics, **risperidone and aripiprazole** [^112hAqTV] have strong evidence and FDA approval [^113iqRsq] for irritability in ASD [^111unrnh], whereas **lurasidone** [^111KtMyp] lacks FDA approval or robust evidence for irritability and is generally reserved for cases in which first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

In ASD, risperidone and aripiprazole [^112hAqTV] are **first-line** for irritability after behavioral interventions fail [^111unrnh] [^116GLwfM]. In dementia, atypical antipsychotics are **generally avoided** [^117VrDS6] due to increased mortality and stroke risk [^117LCQVH]. For bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, lurasidone is approved for these conditions [^111KtMyp] but is **not specifically indicated for irritability**.

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

- **Patient selection**: Consider lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments (risperidone, aripiprazole) fail or are contraindicated [^1168Qirm].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms [^117Vzyec], metabolic changes, and prolactin levels [^115R7xq6].

- **Dosing**: Start at 20 mg/day [^115SjZZs], titrate based on response and tolerability, with a typical range of 20–120 mg/day [^115eVA5H].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lurasidone is **not FDA-approved for irritability** [^111KtMyp] in any condition, including ASD and dementia-related agitation. It may indirectly reduce irritability in schizophrenia and bipolar depression but is not specifically indicated for this symptom. Risperidone and aripiprazole remain first-line for irritability in ASD [^111unrnh], while atypical antipsychotics are generally avoided in dementia due to safety concerns [^117VrDS6]. Use lurasidone for irritability only when first-line treatments fail or are contraindicated, with close monitoring for side effects.

### Aripiprazole for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^112hAqTV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Antipsychotics have been used as a medication intervention for irritability related to ASD. Aripiprazole, a third-generation, atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug that has a unique mechanism of action different from that of other antipsychotics. This review updates a previous Cochrane review on the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole for individuals with ASD, published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole as medication treatment for individuals with ASD.

- **Search methods**: In October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and seven other databases as well as two trial registers. We searched for records published in 1990 or later, as this was the year aripiprazole became available.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of aripiprazole (administered orally and at any dosage) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently collected, evaluated, and analysed data. We performed meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes when possible. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence.

- **Main results**: We included three trials in this review.

### Ziprasidone [^116qw4JP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Limited data from a published case report indicate the presence of ziprasidone in human milk. Although there are no reports of adverse effects on a breastfed infant exposed to ziprasidone via breast milk, there are reports of excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in infants exposed to other atypical antipsychotics through breast milk [see Clinical Considerations]. There is no information on the effects of ziprasidone on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ziprasidone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ziprasidone or from the mother's underlying condition.

	- **Clinical considerations**: Infants exposed to ziprasidone should be monitored for excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements).

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**:

	- **Infertility**: Based on the pharmacologic action of ziprasidone (D₂ antagonism), treatment with ziprasidone may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of ziprasidone have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric information is approved for Viatris Specialty LLC's Geodon (ziprasidone HCl) capsules.

### Treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and irritability: Results from the multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD (MTA) [^115CW1BS]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Clinically impairing irritability affects 25% to 45% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); yet, we know little about what interventions are effective in treating children with ADHD and co-occurring irritability. We used data from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) to address three aims: to establish whether irritability in children with ADHD can be distinguished from other symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD); to examine whether ADHD treatment is effective in treating irritability; and to examine how irritability influences ADHD treatment outcomes.

- **Method**: Secondary analyses of data from the MTA included multivariate analyses, and intent-to-treat random-effects regression models were used.

- **Results**: Irritability was separable from other ODD symptoms. For treating irritability, systematic stimulant treatment was superior to behavioral management but not to routine community care. A combination of stimulants and behavioral treatment was superior to community care and to behavioral treatment alone, but not to medication alone. Irritability did not moderate the impact of treatment on parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in any of the four treatment groups.

- **Conclusion**: Treatments targeting ADHD symptoms are helpful for improving irritability in children with ADHD. Moreover, irritability does not appear to influence the response to treatment of ADHD.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^1159PgAw]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Lurasidone's effectiveness in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder was evaluated over a 24-week period in an open-label extension study. The study aimed to provide insights into its sustained efficacy and safety profile. Participants were monitored for changes in mood stabilization and side effects throughout the study duration.

Overall, the research contributes to understanding the potential of lurasidone as a treatment option for bipolar disorder, despite the study's lower credibility due to its open-label design and the journal's ranking.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112CXfLC]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Lurasidone has been shown to be safe and efficacious in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. In this study, the first to evaluate the effects of long-term treatment in this patient population, once-daily doses of lurasidone, in the range of 20–120 mg for up to 6 months, appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with minimal effects on weight and metabolic parameters. Safety outcomes were not different for monotherapy compared with adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Treatment with lurasidone was associated with sustained improvement in depressive symptoms and in patient-rated measures of quality of life and functioning.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^111rt4pm]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In individuals with ASD, it can be challenging to determine the underlying cause of irritability, which is a crucial first step for determining the appropriate treatment. Unrecognized or untreated medical/physical issues may be at the root of irritability in some cases. Possible medical issues include but are not limited to headaches, oral abscesses, ear infections, constipation, GERD, etc. In such cases, proper medical attention can alleviate irritability.

Similarly, irritability may be a manifestation of an additional psychiatric condition, in which case treatment should target that condition. In these cases, there are typically more symptoms than just irritability, such as sleep, appetite, and/or concentration changes. For example, mood disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorders may present as irritability in ASD, and ADHD-related impulsivity may be driving emotional dysregulation that manifests as irritability. A clinical data review of 123 psychiatrically referred youth with ASD suggested that complaints of irritability may be a primary presentation of depression in this population.

It is important to assess early on whether one or more of these physical or psychiatric factors or behavioral or communicative needs are underlying or exacerbating irritability to treat the root cause. Considering the number and complexity of potential underlying causes of irritability, an ideal assessment pathway involves multidisciplinary, expert input. An extensive practice pathway for irritability was described by McGuire et al. 2016.

### Irritability as a transdiagnostic construct across childhood and adolescence: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kqcVd]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA; Page et al; see Supplementary Table S1) and was registered with Prospero (CRD42023404623). A search of five electronic databases was conducted in June 2024. The databases included were PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Scopus. The search terms used were irritability [OR temperament OR negative affectivity] AND child [OR preschool OR early years OR adolescence] AND psychological [OR mental health OR psychopathology OR psychological disorder OR depression OR anxiety OR oppositional defiant disorder OR conduct disorder OR ADHD OR suicide OR autism OR internalizing OR externalizing OR substance OR abuse OR obsessive-compulsive disorder OR eating disorder OR social functioning OR emotional functioning]. No date limits were set in the search, nor were there restrictions regarding language or the type of publication. A manual search was conducted on the reference list of studies that met inclusion criteria to identify relevant studies not included in the databases. In cases where studies did not report sufficient information to convert a score into a zero-order correlation, additional data were requested by email. A total of 58 authors were contacted for this purpose, with data provided by 20 authors (a response rate of 34%).

Studies that reported on measures of irritability in children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 18 years, in relation to mental health outcomes, were eligible.

### Psychopharmacology management in autism spectrum disorder [^114hMvKh]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). High credibility.

Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have other psychiatric conditions that warrant treatment. Symptoms may not be easy to discern from rigidity or irritability, which are sometimes considered constituent parts of ASD. Pathophysiology involving hyperexcitable neurons and anomalous connectivity may justify using psychopharmacologic agents, although nonmedical strategies may also be effective. Hyperactivity, irritability, and tantrums, with or without aggression, may be rational targets for psychopharmacological intervention. The best-studied drug class at the time of writing has been the second-generation antipsychotics targeting irritability.

### Lurasidone for the treatment of major depressive disorder with mixed features: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115zyh17]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence indicates that manic symptoms below the threshold for hypomania (mixed features) are common in individuals with major depressive disorder. This form of depression is often severe and is associated with an increased risk for recurrence, suicide attempts, substance abuse, and functional disability. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in major depressive disorder with mixed features.

- **Methods**: Patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder who presented with two or three protocol-defined manic symptoms were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with either lurasidone at 20–60 mg/day (N = 109) or placebo (N = 100). Changes from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score (MADRS; primary outcome measure) and Clinical Global Impressions severity subscale score (CGI-S; key secondary outcome measure) were evaluated using a mixed model for repeated-measures analysis.

- **Results**: Lurasidone significantly improved depressive symptoms and overall illness severity, assessed by least squares mean change at week 6 in the MADRS and CGI-S scores: -20.5 compared with -13.0 (effect size, 0.80) and -1.8 compared with -1.2 (effect size, 0.60), respectively. Significant improvement in manic symptoms, assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale, was also observed, in addition to other secondary efficacy endpoints. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were low. The most common adverse events were nausea (6.4% and 2.0% in the lurasidone and placebo groups, respectively) and somnolence (5.5%).

### Lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114nqct5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Lurasidone is a novel psychotropic agent with high affinity for D₂ and 5-HT₂A receptors, as well as receptors implicated in the enhancement of cognition and mood and the reduction of negative symptoms (5-HT₇, 5-HT₁A, and α₂C). The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurasidone in patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia.

Patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with a fixed dose of lurasidone 80 mg (N = 90, 75.6% male, mean age = 39.7 years, mean baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [BPRSd] = 55.1) or placebo (N = 90, 77.8% male, mean age = 41.9 years, mean BPRSd score = 56.1). The primary efficacy measure was the BPRSd. The study was conducted from May to December 2004.

At day 42, last-observation-carried-forward endpoint, treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the BPRSd (least squares mean ± SE = -8.9 ± 1.3 vs. -4.2 ± 1.4; p = .012) as well as all secondary efficacy measures, including the PANSS total score (-14.1 ± 2.1 vs. -5.5 ± 2.2; p = .004) and the PANSS positive (-4.3 ± 0.7 vs. -1.7 ± 0.7; p = .006), negative (-2.9 ± 0.5 vs. -1.3 ± 0.5; p = .025), and general psychopathology (-7.0 ± 1.1 vs. -2.7 ± 1.2; p = .0061) subscales. Significant improvement was seen as early as day 3, based on BPRSd, PANSS, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness assessments.

### Treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and irritability: Results from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA) [^116T7Eq6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Clinically impairing irritability affects 25% to 45% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); yet, we know little about what interventions are effective in treating children with ADHD and co-occurring irritability. We used data from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA) to address three aims: to establish whether irritability in children with ADHD can be distinguished from other symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), to examine whether ADHD treatment is effective in treating irritability, and to examine how irritability influences ADHD treatment outcomes.

- **Method**: Secondary analyses of data from the MTA included multivariate analyses. Intent-to-treat random-effects regression models were used.

- **Results**: Irritability was separable from other ODD symptoms. For treating irritability, systematic stimulant treatment was superior to behavioral management, but not to routine community care. A combination of stimulants and behavioral treatment was superior to community care and to behavioral treatment alone, but not to medication alone. Irritability did not moderate the impact of treatment on parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in any of the four treatment groups.

- **Conclusion**: Treatments targeting ADHD symptoms are helpful for improving irritability in children with ADHD. Moreover, irritability does not appear to influence the response to treatment of ADHD.

### Risperidone treatment of autistic disorder: longer-term benefits and blinded discontinuation after 6 months [^115SLLUb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Risperidone is effective for the short-term treatment of aggression, temper outbursts, and self-injurious behavior in children with autism. Because these behaviors may be chronic, there is a need to establish the efficacy and safety of longer-term treatment with this agent.

The authors conducted a multisite, two-part study of risperidone in children ages 5 to 17 years with autism accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, and/or self-injurious behavior who showed a positive response in an earlier 8-week trial. Part I consisted of a 4-month open-label treatment with risperidone, starting at the established optimal dose; part II was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-substitution study of risperidone withdrawal. Primary outcome measures were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression improvement scale.

Part I included 63 children. The mean risperidone dose was 1.96 mg/day at entry and remained stable over 16 weeks of open treatment. The change on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale was small and clinically insignificant. Reasons for discontinuation of part I included loss of efficacy (N = 5) and adverse effects (N = 1). The subjects gained an average of 5.1 kg. Part II included 32 patients. The relapse rates were 62.5% for gradual placebo substitution and 12.5% for continued risperidone; this difference was statistically significant.

Risperidone showed persistent efficacy and good tolerability for intermediate-length treatment of children with autism characterized by ta.

### Efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for bipolar depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^1167zkKq]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

In terms of acceptability, this meta-analysis found no significant association between lurasidone dosage and the incidence of critical issues, such as dropout, mania, or suicide. These findings suggest that increasing doses of lurasidone remain relatively safe, mitigating concerns about their usage in clinical practice. However, our results still indicate that, with increasing dose, the risk of side effects, such as akathisia or parkinsonism, do increase. This highlights the continued need for clinicians to be aware of these non-urgent adverse effects when adjusting lurasidone dosage. Additionally, we observed a trend of protective efficacy against manic switch at daily doses above 50–60 mg (figure 2B). This may be explained by lurasidone's role as a full antagonist of the dopamine D₂ receptor.

Lurasidone has three broad categories of metabolic and endocrine effects. First, certain dose ranges significantly increase the risk of adverse effects, such as weight gain. Below 60 mg, weight increased significantly (figure 3A). Interestingly, a trend towards weight reduction was observed at higher doses of lurasidone (greater than 70–80 mg). This effect may be attributed to lurasidone's 5-HT7 receptor inverse agonism, which suppresses adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signalling in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby mitigating the risk of weight gain as compared with other antipsychotics. Another outcome measure was an increase in fasting blood glucose levels; our findings suggested a significant risk at doses above 70 mg (figure 3E).

### Lurasidone as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113AtcCp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Few studies have been reported that support the efficacy of adjunctive therapy for patients with bipolar I depression who have had an insufficient response to monotherapy with mood-stabilizing agents. The authors investigated the efficacy of lurasidone, a novel antipsychotic agent, as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the treatment of bipolar I depression.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive six weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with lurasidone (N = 183) or placebo (N = 165), added to therapeutic levels of either lithium or valproate. Primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week six on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and depression severity score on the Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in bipolar illness (CGI-BP), respectively.

Lurasidone treatment significantly reduced the mean MADRS total score at week six compared with the placebo group (-17.1 versus -13.5; effect size = 0.34). Similarly, lurasidone treatment resulted in significantly greater endpoint reduction in CGI-BP depression severity scores compared with placebo (-1.96 versus -1.51; effect size = 0.36) as well as significantly greater improvement in anxiety symptoms and in patient-reported measures of quality of life and functional impairment. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 6.0% and 7.9% in the lurasidone and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events most frequently reported for lurasidone were nausea, somnolence, tremor, akathisia, and insomnia. Minimal changes in weight, lipids, and measures of glyc were observed.

### Lurasidone for the treatment of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia: a 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^113pVwUG]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of established antipsychotic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia, there remain unmet needs for effective medications with a lower adverse-effect burden. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone for patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients were randomized to six weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone at doses of 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, or 120 mg/day, or a placebo.

Changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis. Vital signs, laboratory parameters, extrapyramidal symptoms, and electrocardiogram were assessed. Treatment with lurasidone at 80 mg/day resulted in significantly greater improvement in PANSS total scores compared with placebo (-23.4 versus -17.0; p < 0.05) at the study endpoint (MMRM). Lurasidone at both 40 mg/day and 120 mg/day achieved clinically meaningful overall PANSS score reductions from baseline (-19.2 and -20.5), but did not show significant separation from placebo. Differences between all lurasidone groups and placebo for changes in laboratory parameters and electrocardiographic measures were minimal.

Weight gain of ≥ 7% occurred in 8.2% of patients receiving lurasidone and 3.2% receiving placebo. Modest increases in prolactin (median increase, 0.7 ng/mL) and extrapyramidal symptoms were observed following treatment with lurasidone compared with placebo. Akathisia was the most commonly reported adverse event with lurasidone (17.6% versus 3.1% with placebo).

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^117Vzyec]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Neurological effects, including EPS:

Tremor can be a significant cause of frustration for many patients and is experienced by up to 10% of those treated with lithium or divalproex. New onset neurological symptoms in patients on divalproex should raise suspicion of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, which, while rare, can be potentially fatal, and hence early detection and discontinuation of divalproex is critical to prevent morbidity and mortality. Sustained release formulations and dose reductions may limit symptoms.

While conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are often associated with EPS (including pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia), this risk is either absent or low with atypical antipsychotic agents. Among the atypical agents, risperidone, aripiprazole, cariprazine, ziprasidone, and lurasidone are more likely to cause EPS, particularly at higher doses. In older patients, impaired swallowing function and dysphagia have also been linked to atypical agents, particularly at higher doses.

Although rare, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse event associated with antipsychotic agents. The risk with atypical agents was considered negligible initially; however, while the risk is very low, several atypical agents have nevertheless been associated with NMS. While generally unpredictable, the risk is greatest during the initial phase of treatment or change of dosage, particularly with intravenous or intramuscular administration or high doses.

### Efficacy and safety of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115QH82f]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar depression.

- **Method**: Patients aged 10 to 17 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of lurasidone, ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score, evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 347 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of lurasidone (n = 175; mean age 14.2 years; mean dose 33.6 mg/day) or placebo (n = 172; mean age 14.3 years). At week 6, treatment with lurasidone was associated with statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in CDRS-R total score (-21.0 versus -15.3; p < .0001; effect size 0.45). Lurasidone also was associated with statistically significant improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Severity depression score (key secondary measure), as well as in measures of anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning. Study completion rates were 92.0% in the lurasidone group and 89.7% in the placebo group; discontinuation rates due to adverse events were the same for both groups (1.7%). The two most common adverse events associated with lurasidone were nausea and somnolence. Treatment with lurasidone was associated with minimal effects on weight and metabolic parameters.

- **Conclusion**: In this placebo-controlled study, monotherapy with lurasidone, in doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day, significantly decreased depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression.

### Lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and olanzapine-controlled study [^116wiGQn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The study was designed to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. Participants, who were recently admitted inpatients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with 40 mg of lurasidone, 120 mg of lurasidone, 15 mg of olanzapine (included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo, dosed once daily.

Efficacy was evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the change from baseline to week 6 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score as the primary efficacy measure and the Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) score as the key secondary efficacy measure.

Treatment with both doses of lurasidone or with olanzapine was associated with significantly greater improvement at week 6 on the PANSS total score, PANSS positive and negative subscale scores, and CGI-S score compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in mean PANSS total or CGI-S change scores for the lurasidone groups compared with the olanzapine group. With responders defined as those with an improvement of at least 20% on the PANSS, endpoint responder rates were significant compared with placebo for olanzapine only.

The incidence of akathisia was higher with 120 mg of lurasidone (22.9%) than with 40 mg of lurasidone (11.8%), olanzapine (7.4%), or placebo (0.9%). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 7% weight gain was 5.9% for the lurasidone groups combined and 34.4% for the olanzapine group.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^1162Fhdg]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

For both the monotherapy and adjunctive treatment groups combined, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by patients. The greatest proportion of patients reported experiencing the following adverse events: Parkinsonism (10.7%; a combined term consisting of bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drooling, hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, Parkinsonism, psychomotor retardation, and tremor), akathisia (8.1%), somnolence (8.0%; a combined term consisting of hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence), headache (7.7%), nausea (7.6%), insomnia (6.4%), and anxiety (5.8%). The proportion of patients reporting Parkinsonism, akathisia, somnolence, and anxiety was higher for lurasidone in the adjunctive therapy group compared with the monotherapy group by 2.3 to 7.7%. Insomnia increased to a marginal extent (0.2%). There was no consistent trend observed for other adverse events.

Both for patients treated with lurasidone as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, the majority of adverse events were classified as either mild (44.9% and 52.3%) or moderate (29.1% and 37.2%) in severity. For the combined treatment groups, the three individual treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) most frequently rated as "severe" were akathisia (1.4%), depression (1.1%), and insomnia (0.5%). Among patients discontinuing due to a TEAE, akathisia (1.1%) was the most frequently cited; other TEAEs were cited with a percentage of less than 0.5%.

### Aripiprazole for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^116tW6oo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Irritability related to ASD has been treated with antipsychotics. Aripiprazole, a third-generation atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug with a unique mechanism of action different from other antipsychotics.

- **Objectives**: To determine the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole for individuals with ASD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases on 4th May 2011: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to April Week 3 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 17), PsycINFO (1887 to current), CINAHL (1937 to current), WorldCat, ZETOC, Autism Data, Conference Proceedings Index-S, Conference Proceedings Index-SSH, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. We searched for records published in 1990 or later, as this was the year aripiprazole became available.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of aripiprazole versus placebo for the treatment of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently collected, evaluated, and analyzed data. We performed meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes when possible.

- **Main results**: Two randomized controlled trials with similar methodology have evaluated the use of aripiprazole for a duration of eight weeks in 316 children with ASD. The included trials had a low risk of bias. Although we searched for studies across age groups, only studies in children and youth were found.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^115RLhKM]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The primary limitation of the study was its open-label, uncontrolled design and lack of an active comparator or placebo control group. Although the percentage of adverse effects in the study was low, precise determination of drug-specific rates of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was not possible due to the absence of a control group. In addition, patients who received lurasidone in the acute treatment study may represent a more lurasidone-tolerant group. The absence of random assignment to placebo in the study precludes making inferences about relapse prevention effectiveness associated with maintenance lurasidone treatment. Additional limitations include the sample size and the 6-month duration of the trial, which may be insufficient to adequately assess rare or very gradually developing safety issues. Future controlled trials are warranted to confirm the effectiveness and safety of long-term treatment with lurasidone in this population.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^112g5gHt]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Irritability in the DSM-5 is defined as "persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters". Irritability is often used as an umbrella term for behavioral symptoms associated with various disorders, including ASD, which can consist of one or a combination of the following: extreme tantrums, aggression towards people or property, severe mood lability, and self-injurious behavior (SIB). The DSM-5-TR lists irritability as a symptom of various mood and behavioral disorders such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Within the context of ASD, irritability may be a manifestation of an additional psychiatric condition such as ADHD or a mood disorder, for example. Irritability may also be a symptom of underlying medical issues such as gastrointestinal discomfort or related to difficulty communicating.

Irritability is common in ASD. Parent reports of physical aggression in a cohort of 1,380 children and adolescents with ASD showed that 35% were currently exhibiting significant aggression towards a caregiver or another person and that 49% had demonstrated some form of aggression towards others in the past. A recent meta-study reported that prevalence rates of SIB in the ASD population may be as high as 42%. Severe irritability can impact relationships, access to educational programming and therapeutic/behavioral services, and work opportunities, leading to stress and reduced quality of life for individuals, family members, and caregivers.

### Lurasidone dose escalation in early nonresponding patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1142QuhP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of dose increase in adult patients with schizophrenia who demonstrate an inadequate initial response to standard-dose lurasidone and to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose lurasidone in adult patients with schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted between May 2013 and June 2014, hospitalized patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 mg/day (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/day (n = 199), or placebo (n = 112). Nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/day (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score decrease < 20%) at 2 weeks were re-randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/day or 160 mg/day for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score.

- **Results**: In nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/day (n = 95), a dose increase to 160 mg/day at week 2 significantly reduced the PANSS total score at the week 6 study endpoint compared with continuing 80 mg/day (-16.6 vs. -8.9; P < .05; effect size = 0.52). While a comparable magnitude of improvement was observed in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from week 2 to week 6 endpoints for lurasidone 160 mg/day versus 80 mg/day (-1.0 vs. -0.6; effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/day did not demonstrate significant improvement compared with the placebo at week 6 in PANSS total (-17.6 vs. -14.5; p = 0.26) or CGI-S (-0.93 vs. -0.73; p = 0.17) scores.

Few dose-related adverse effects were noted during the study.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^115NwNwo]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 6 months of open-label, uncontrolled extension treatment with lurasidone in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar depression who completed 6 weeks of acute treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients completing 6 weeks of double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with either lurasidone monotherapy (one study) or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (two studies) were treated for 6 months with flexible doses of lurasidone, 20–120 mg/day, in an open-label, uncontrolled extension study (N = 813; monotherapy, 38.9%; adjunctive therapy, 61.1%). Changes in safety parameters were calculated from double-blind, acute-phase baseline to month 6 of the extension phase, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF endpoint) analysis.

- **Results**: Five hundred fifty-nine of 817 (68.4%) patients completed the extension study. In the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, 6.9% and 9.0%, respectively, discontinued due to an adverse event. For the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, respectively, changes from double-blind baseline to month 6 were +0.8 and +0.9 kg for weight (mean), 0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL for total cholesterol (median), +5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL for triglycerides (median), −1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL for glucose (median); −22.6 and −21.7 for Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; mean). Changes from open-label baseline to month 6 were +0.85 and +0.88 kg for weight (mean) and −6.9 and −6.5 for MADRS (mean).

Six months of treatment with open-label lurasidone was safe and well tolerated.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for persistent nonepisodic irritability [^112QRa49]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

This meta-analysis examined the efficacy of available pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for irritability among youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), and/or severe mood dysregulation (SMD).

Literature searches were conducted in October 2020, resulting in 564 abstracts being reviewed to identify relevant papers, with 387 articles being reviewed in full. A random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, with subgroup meta-regressions run to assess effects of study design, intervention type, medication class, and clinical population.

A total of 101 studies were included (80 pharmacological, 13 nonpharmacological, 8 combined). Despite high heterogeneity in effects (I² = 94.3%), the pooled posttreatment effect size for decreasing irritability was large (Hedges' g = 1.62).

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Large effects were found (g = 1.85).
- **Nonpharmacological interventions**: Large effects were noted (g = 1.11).
- **Combined interventions**: Moderate effects were found relative to monotherapy interventions (g = 0.69).

Antipsychotic medications provided the largest effect for reducing irritability relative to all other medication classes and nonpharmacological interventions. A large effect was found for youth with ASD (g = 1.89), whereas a medium effect was found for youth with ADHD/DMDD/DBD/SMD (g = 0.64).

This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive review of interventions targeting persistent nonepisodic irritability among these populations.

### Antipsychotic use trends in youth with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability: A meta-analysis [^111xMDGW]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review antipsychotic prescribing patterns in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability (ID), where irritability and aggression are relevant treatment targets.

The method involved a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE/PsycInfo until March 2015 for studies on the frequency of youth diagnosed with ASDs and/or ID among antipsychotic-treated youth, conducting a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis of potential moderators. These included publication year, study time point, country, setting, sample size, age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Results indicated that 39 studies were meta-analyzed (n = 365,449, age = 11.4 ± 6.2 years, males = 70.0% ± 10.0%). Among 27 studies (n = 273,139, age = 11.9 ± 8.0 years, males = 67.0% ± 12.9%) focusing on antipsychotic-treated youth, 9.5% (95% CI = 7.8%-11.5%) were diagnosed with ASD/ID. In 20 studies (n = 209,756) that reported data separately for ASD, 7.9% (95% CI = 6.2%-9.9%) had an ASD diagnosis. In 5 longitudinal studies, the proportion of antipsychotic-treated youth with ASD showed no significant change from 1996 to 2011 (6.7% to 5.8%, odds ratio = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8–1.0, p = .17). However, more recent studies indicated a higher proportion of ASD/ID diagnoses (β = 0.12, p < .00001). In 13 studies (n = 96,688, age = 9.8 ± 1.2 years, males = 78.6% ± 2.0%) on antipsychotic use in ASD samples, 17.5% (95% CI = 13.7%-22.1%) received antipsychotics. Additionally, more recent study time points moderated higher ASD/ID diagnosis rates.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^1168Qirm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

What are my pharmacological choices for the management of aggression in a child with ASD when standard options seem to have failed?

For some children, behavioral interventions combined with 'first line' medications, as suggested above, fail to alleviate symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, and it is crucial at the outset that these are explored. The diagnostic formulation may have missed an important etiological factor, or previously identified triggers or perpetuating factors may have been inadequately managed. For example, an environment with certain characteristics, such as routine, predictability, and appropriate level of stimulation, may not be made available, or there may be an absence of adequately trained support staff who fail to follow behavioral recommendations. In these circumstances, it is crucial that medication does not become the perceived 'solution'. It is unethical for the psychiatrist to be expected to medicate where services are unable to meet needs.

On the other hand, there will be situations where challenging behavior continues despite attention to all identified etiological factors. Such situations are most likely to arise in the context of non-verbal autistic children who are severely or profoundly cognitively impaired. While it remains important to continue to work towards a greater understanding of the behavior's underpinning, this is often very challenging, and medication may thus be considered as a least restrictive, best interest option in consultation with decision-makers. Additionally, the psychiatrist should…

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112jAD3b]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

In the monotherapy group, the proportion reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was somewhat lower for patients switching from acute study placebo to lurasidone compared to patients continuing on lurasidone (58.5% vs. 63.8%); in the adjunctive therapy group, the proportion was higher (70.4% vs. 63.8%).

During the extension study, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 3.0% of patients, including 2.2% in the monotherapy group, and 3.4% in the adjunctive therapy group. The following serious adverse events were reported in the overall safety population: worsening depression (n = 8; 1.0%), suicidal ideation (n = 3; 0.4%), bone fractures (n = 3; 0.4%), suicide attempt (n = 2; 0.2%), mania (n = 2; 0.2%), and one for each of the following events: pancreatitis, appendicitis, a hypersensitivity reaction, skin neoplasm, and lumbar spinal stenosis. In addition, two deaths were reported during the study; each was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication: a motor vehicle accident death (in a patient who completed 6 weeks of double-blind adjunctive therapy with lurasidone 60 mg, and 11 days of open-label adjunctive therapy with lurasidone 60 mg), and a suicide by hanging (occurred 7 days after taking a single extension study dose of lurasidone in a patient who previously received placebo in the acute monotherapy study). Based on C-SSRS results, treatment with lurasidone was associated with the emergence of suicidal ideation or behavior at some point during the 6-month study in 5.0% of patients in the monotherapy group.

Behavioral and educational strategies can be implemented to assist in the management of irritability. A functional behavioral assessment from a school behavioralist can offer helpful insight into the function of disruptive behaviors, such as escaping aversive stimuli like a loud room or accessing rewarding or soothing stimuli like getting caregiver attention. When the function of a behavior can be determined, a behavioral team can develop a plan to reduce the frequency of maladaptive behaviors through adjustments to the environment and caregiver response patterns that aim to decrease the persistence of the behavior. Parent training, namely targeted skill development for caregivers in addressing maladaptive behavior, has shown potential to reduce irritability. The RUBI Parent Training for Disruptive Behavior was specifically endorsed by Lurie Center providers, and preliminary efficacy findings in recent feasibility studies are promising.

When behavioral options are ineffective, or irritability is in the moderate to severe range, providers may turn to pharmacological treatments for non-specific irritability (Fig. 5, Table 9). The ABC-Irritability subscale is important to obtain at baseline and throughout the course of treatment of irritability in ASD.

Medication options and dosing for irritability in patients with ASD include:

- **ER (Extended-release), IR (Immediate-release)**: When pharmacological treatments are appropriate, α₂-adrenergic agonists such as guanfacine are a good option to begin with based on their safety.

Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)

Second-line therapies are considered when first-line treatments are not suitable or effective. Although olanzapine (level 1) is effective in preventing mood, manic, or depressive episodes, it is considered second-line due to safety concerns such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has shown efficacy in preventing mood or manic episodes, with no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention. Additionally, oral risperidone adjunctive therapy showed a trend toward superiority at 6 months in preventing any mood or mania episodes but not depression.

Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been evaluated in large placebo-controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing mood or manic episodes but less effective than olanzapine. Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing mood or manic episodes, although conflicting data exist for acute treatment. Lurasidone adjunctive therapy showed a trend for superiority in preventing any mood episode, but not individually manic or depressive episodes, with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. Therefore, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be suitable for individuals who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^116cff4B]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Lurasidone was not associated with clinically significant findings on laboratory, ECG, or vital sign parameters. Minimal effects were observed on weight, lipids, and measures of glycemic control; no meaningful differences were observed for lurasidone when administered as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy. There is an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in the bipolar disorder population. The relatively benign cardiometabolic risk profile of lurasidone may make it a potentially safer treatment option in this vulnerable clinical population.

The occurrence of protocol-specified treatment-emergent mania was relatively low among patients treated with adjunctive lurasidone (3.8%) and lurasidone monotherapy (1.3%). Because no parallel placebo or active control group was available, the drug-specific effect of lurasidone on the percentage of mania is unclear. However, the results appear comparable to the percentage of mania (< 5%) reported at 6 months in two long-term trials of quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate in bipolar disorder.

Throughout the 6-month course of treatment, mean depressive symptom scores continued to show improvement from open-label baseline. As expected, patients who were switched from double-blind placebo to lurasidone in the extension study showed greater additional improvement at 6 months compared with patients who continued on lurasidone in the extension study. As a result, MADRS scores were similar at month 6 regardless of prior treatment assignment during the double-blind 6-week phase.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115qGP8k]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Aggression is one of the most frequent reasons for referral to specialist services for a child with ASD, particularly among those children with ASD who have co-morbid intellectual disability. From the outset, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial in any such assessment to identify the relevant underlying factors so these can be managed. Aggression is not a diagnosis; instead, it is a mechanism for the communication of need, discomfort, or distress. The clinical team must identify the relevant biological, psychological, and social predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors so that these can be managed accordingly.

In rare instances, major life events or factors such as constipation or pain are key; more commonly, multiple factors are relevant. Aggression may also be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric diagnosis such as depression or psychosis, which should be managed accordingly. Despite the recommendations made below, it is important to bear in mind that psychotropic medication can itself result in agitation, anxiety, and mood disturbance. Therefore, careful attention needs to be paid to the possibility that symptoms may worsen as a result of medication.

In the management of aggression, medication may be deemed an appropriate option in several situations. For example, in the acute situation where it would be difficult or potentially unsafe to introduce behavioral therapy, medication can offer the possibility of reducing the severity of symptoms.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Adjunctive use**: Antidepressant therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or bupropion) with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size.

This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants since historically much of the focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation. As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling. Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should NOT be used for the treatment of BDI depression.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: A conceptual and quantitative review [^113vjpiE]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There is indirect evidence from the adult literature that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be effective in the treatment of irritability, aggression, and explosive outbursts in the context of mood disorders (depression, dysthymic disorder, premenstrual syndrome, or anxiety), and intermittent explosive disorder. However, none of these trials has targeted irritability in itself. Trials of SSRIs following a stimulant lead-in phase are ongoing at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), but no other research in young people has been published.

Antipsychotics may be effective in decreasing irritability and aggression in children with sub-average IQ and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the extent to which irritability in those trials (typically measured by observation using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist) corresponds to irritability as defined in most studies quoted in this article remains unclear.

For psychological interventions, parent training may be effective in reducing irritability in children with ODD and ASD. In addition, individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated effectiveness in youth with excessive anger and Tourette syndrome. Individual CBT also reduced temper outbursts in a clinical sample of young people with OCD and depressive symptoms, but this was not a trial design. Group CBT has been shown to be effective in one trial of youth with ADHD plus SMD.

Recently, and based on the work of Penton-Voak et al, Stoddard et al. tested whether the judgment of ambiguous faces as angry could be modulated through training.

### Irritability and elation in a large bipolar youth sample: Relative symptom severity and clinical outcomes over 4 years [^115sbZDR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the relative severity of irritability symptoms versus elation symptoms in mania is stable and predicts the subsequent illness course in youth with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder, or operationally defined bipolar disorder not otherwise specified.

Investigators used the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children to assess the most severe lifetime manic episode in bipolar youth aged 7–17 years. Participants were recruited from 2000 to 2006 as part of the Course and Outcomes of Bipolar Youth prospective cohort study (N = 361), conducted at university-affiliated mental health clinics. Subjects with at least 4 years of follow-up (N = 309) were categorized at baseline as irritable-only (n = 30), elated-only (n = 42), or both irritable and elated (n = 237).

- **Stability of categorization**: Over the follow-up period, the primary outcome measured was the stability of these baseline categorizations. Additionally, researchers compared the course of mood symptoms and episodes, the risk of suicide attempt, and functioning over the follow-up between the baseline groups.

Results indicated that most subjects experienced both irritability and elation during follow-up, and the agreement between baseline and follow-up group assignment did not exceed what was expected by chance (κ = 0.03; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.12). Elated-only subjects were most likely to report the absence of both irritability and elation symptoms at every follow-up assessment (35.7%), compared to 26.7% of irritable-only subjects and 16.9% of those with both irritability and elation (P = 0.01). Baseline groups experienced mania or hypomania for a similar proportion of the follow-up period.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: A conceptual and quantitative review [^114cBhwi]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The main aim of this review was to assess the status of irritability in nosology by examining whether irritability is a reliable and valid construct. Using a combination of selective and systematic reviewing, as well as a meta-analysis, we found that irritability can be measured reliably and forms a distinguishable factor with distinct longitudinal predictions. This is particularly evident for irritability as a dimensional construct, which shows reliability and predictive value comparable to that in other psychiatric entities, such as anxiety or hyperactivity. Moreover, we showed that irritability is a robust predictor of future emotional disorders, particularly depression, as well as overall social role impairment.

These findings are particularly relevant as it had been claimed that irritability is to psychopathology what fever is to general medicine. This analogy may not apply for two reasons. First, in contrast to fever, irritability does not seem to be simply the generic expression of different types of problems, but it is differentially related to depression and anxiety in longitudinal and genetic studies. Second, irritability appears to be associated with future impairment even when adjusting for other aspects of psychopathology, suggesting that, unlike most cases of pyrexia, it may have long-lasting consequences. However, it is clear that much work is required to better understand the position of irritability in nosology. Below, we provide an outline of what we consider to be important next steps in the field.

### Effectiveness of lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder switched from other antipsychotics: A randomized, 6-week, open-label study [^113qKT3o]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the effectiveness of switching patients to lurasidone using three different dosing strategies.

- **Method**: Adults with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a nonacute phase of illness were randomized to one of three lurasidone dosing regimens for the initial two weeks of the study: (1) 40 mg/day for two weeks; (2) 40 mg/day for one week, increased to 80 mg/day on day 8 for week 2 (up-titration group); and (3) 80 mg/day for two weeks. Lurasidone was then flexibly dosed (40–120 mg/day) for the subsequent four weeks of the study. The preswitch antipsychotic agent was tapered by day 7 to 50% of the original dose and discontinued by the end of week 2. Subjects were stratified on the basis of whether the primary preswitch antipsychotic medication was classified as "sedating" (olanzapine or quetiapine) or "nonsedating" (all other antipsychotics). The primary outcome measure was time to treatment failure, defined as any occurrence of insufficient clinical response, exacerbation of underlying disease, or discontinuation due to an adverse event. The study was conducted from June 2010 to May 2011.

- **Results**: Of 240 subjects treated in this study, 86 (35.8%) were treated with an antecedent sedating antipsychotic, and 154 (64.2%) were treated with an antecedent nonsedating antipsychotic. Nineteen (7.9%) of the 240 patients experienced treatment failure. No clinically relevant differences were observed when the three randomized switch groups were compared. Treatment failure rates were 10/86 (11.6%) versus 9/154 (5.8%) among subjects who had been receiving a preswitch sedating versus nonsedating antipsychotic.

### Long-term safety and effectiveness of open-label lurasidone in antipsychotic-naïve versus previously treated adolescents with schizophrenia: A post-hoc analysis [^116KT235]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). High credibility.

There is a relative lack of long-term, prospective data evaluating the safety and effectiveness of treatment in early-onset adolescent patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-naïve. The aim of this post-hoc analysis was to examine the long-term safety and effectiveness of lurasidone in adolescents with schizophrenia who were antipsychotic treatment-naïve (TN; at the time of enrollment in the initial study) compared to adolescents treated previously (TP) with an antipsychotic.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 13–17 who completed 6 weeks of double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled treatment with lurasidone were enrolled in a 2-year, open-label (OL), flexible-dose (20–80 mg/day) lurasidone study.

- **Results**: The long-term analysis sample consisted of 50 TN and 221 TP patients, of whom 40% and 43%, respectively, discontinued prematurely. The three most common adverse events for TN and TP patients, respectively, were headache (26.0%, 23.5%), schizophrenia (14.0%, 12.2%), dizziness (16.0%, 4.1%), and nausea (16.0%, 11.8%). At endpoint, the mean increase in weight was similar to expected weight gain based on growth charts for both TN (+4.5 kg vs. +5.7 kg) and TP (+4.6 kg vs. +6.6 kg) patients. Minimal changes were observed for each group in metabolic parameters and prolactin. Mean improvement was consistently greater in the TN vs. TP group (-19.2 vs. -15.9; effect size of 0.33) for between-group change in PANSS total score at Week 104.

In both TN and TP adolescents with schizophrenia, long-term treatment with lurasidone was associated with minimal effects on body weight.

Treatment‐emergent mania, as prespecified in the protocol, occurred in 1.3% of patients in the monotherapy group and in 3.8% of patients in the adjunctive group. There was a small decrease in mean YMRS total score from open‐label baseline to extension study month 6 for the lurasidone to lurasidone and placebo to lurasidone groups, respectively, among patients taking monotherapy (−0.6, −1.1) and patients taking adjunctive therapy (−0.5, −0.5).

- **Anticholinergic medication**: The proportion of patients who received treatment with anticholinergic medication for acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was 4.4% in the monotherapy group and 9.5% in the adjunctive group.

- **BARS and SAS scores**: Both monotherapy and adjunctive treatment with lurasidone were associated with negligible mean changes in the BARS global score (≤ 0.1) and SAS 10‐item mean score (≤ 0.04; at LOCF endpoint).

- **AIMS global score**: Categorical worsening in the AIMS global score occurred at low rates in the monotherapy (1.8%) and adjunctive therapy (1.2%) groups.

- **Anxiolytics and antidepressants**: The proportion of patients treated with as‐needed doses of anxiolytics was 7.0% in the monotherapy group and 15.7% in the adjunctive therapy group. The proportion of patients treated with concomitant antidepressants was 5.4% in the monotherapy group and 7.8% in the adjunctive therapy group.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112VJnMg]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Entry into the preceding acute treatment studies was limited to adult outpatients, ages 18–75 years (inclusive), with a DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of bipolar I disorder with a major depressive episode. The duration of the depressive episode was required to be between 4 weeks and 12 months, with a Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥ 20 and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score ≤ 12. Patients with psychotic features were excluded; however, rapid cycling (four to seven episodes in the prior year) was permitted.

Patients were included in the extension study if they were judged by the investigator to be suitable for participation in a 6-month open-label study, able to comply with the protocol, not at imminent risk of suicide or injury to self or others, and if their MADRS item-10 score (suicidal thoughts) was rated as ≤ 3 at open-label baseline.

In order to maintain the blind in the preceding acute treatment trials, all patients who were enrolled in the extension study were started at a dose of 60 mg/day for 1 week, regardless of their original double-blind treatment assignment. Lurasidone was taken orally, once daily in the evening with a meal or within 30 minutes after eating, and adjusted weekly as clinically indicated within the dose range of 20–120 mg/day. Patients treated with lithium or valproate in each of the two acute adjunctive trials were continued on their mood stabilizer, with the recommendation to maintain serum concentrations, which were assessed at baseline and months 3 and 6.

The mean (SD) daily dose of lurasidone during the study was 64.1 (14.4) mg and was similar in the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups. The modal daily doses were: 20 mg for 4.2% of patients, 40 mg for 7.4% of patients, 60 mg for 61.5% of patients, 80 mg for 17.6% of patients, 100 mg for 6.3% of patients, and 120 mg for 3.1% of patients. Among patients entering the open-label extension study from the acute adjunctive therapy studies, 39.4% continued treatment with lithium, and 60.6% were treated with valproate.

- **Adjunctive therapy patients**: The mean dose of lithium was maintained in the range of 905–958 mg/day throughout the 6 months of extension study treatment. Mean serum lithium concentrations ranged from 0.61 to 0.70 mEq/L. The mean dose of valproate was maintained in the range of 1026–1107 mg/day, with mean serum valproate concentrations ranging from 66.3 to 69.3 μg/mL.

- **Results**:

- **Baseline characteristics and patient disposition**: A combined total of 941 patients completed the three double-blind, 6-week, acute-phase studies and were potentially eligible for entry in the open-label extension study. Of this total, 817 patients (86.8%) provided informed consent and entered the extension study, including 319 patients who completed the double-blind acute monotherapy study (lurasidone, N = 212; placebo, N = 107), and 498 patients who completed the two double-blind acute adjunctive therapy studies (lurasidone, N = 254; placebo, N = 244). The safety population consisted of 316 patients from the monotherapy study (two patients in the lurasidone continuation group and one in the placebo-to-lurasidone switch group discontinued before receiving extension study medication) and 497 patients from the adjunctive therapy studies (one patient in the placebo-to-lurasidone switch group discontinued before receiving extension study medication). Among acute monotherapy patients, only 2.2% (n = 7) newly initiated lithium or valproate during the extension study; one adjunctive study patient permanently discontinued mood stabilizer therapy during the extension study.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar for patients who completed the acute monotherapy and adjunctive therapy studies, respectively. A total of 559 patients (68.4%) completed the extension study. The proportion of extension study completers was similar for each acute study treatment group (monotherapy: 71.2% in the lurasidone continuation group).

### Acute treatment of mania: an update on new medications [^111bWgC1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mania is frequently a medical emergency that requires hospitalization for behavioral control, rapid resolution of irritability, and agitation. There is a need for de-escalation of mood and a decrease in risk-taking behavior. Lithium's efficacy in the management of acute mania was first reported in 1949 and the drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Chlorpromazine, from the class of typical antipsychotics, was approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1973.

Typical antipsychotics were frequently used alone and as adjuncts for the treatment of bipolar mania for the next two decades. Divalproex was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute mania in 1994. Since the approval of olanzapine in 2000, all five atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone (2003), quetiapine (2004), ziprasidone (2004), and aripiprazole (2004), have been approved by the FDA for the management of acute mania. Clozapine is the only atypical antipsychotic not FDA approved for any phase of bipolar disorder.

This article will systematically review some of the major studies published, including randomized controlled monotherapy and adjunct therapy trials involving five atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of acute bipolar mania.
