## Question

Why do women have a higher pain threshold than men

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether women have a higher pain threshold than men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of pain threshold versus pain tolerance. Then, I should verify what high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses say about sex differences in pain threshold. Next, I will examine potential biological, psychological, and social mechanisms that could explain any differences. After that, I should check for exceptions or conflicting data and assess clinical relevance. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note practical implications for care and research.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. Pain threshold is the point at which a stimulus becomes painful, whereas pain tolerance is the maximum pain one is willing to endure; these are related but distinct endpoints, and confusing them leads to misinterpretation of the literature, so I need to keep them separate as I proceed [^11247wTe].

> Wait, let me verify the prevailing direction of evidence on pain threshold. Multiple systematic reviews and large-scale syntheses consistently show that women generally have lower pain thresholds than men across several experimental modalities, including pressure, thermal, and electrical stimuli, indicating higher pain sensitivity rather than a higher threshold [^1165gebf] [^113ufkkQ] [^111SdCGg]. I should double-check that this pattern holds across modalities; indeed, reviews note lower thresholds in women for pressure and thermal pain, with some variability by method and stimulus, but the trend is toward greater female sensitivity rather than greater tolerance [^1165gebf] [^113ufkkQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I initially wondered if women might have higher thresholds in some contexts, but that would contradict the bulk of controlled data. Let me reconsider in light of specific findings: women demonstrate lower pressure pain thresholds and lower thermal pain thresholds on average, and they also show greater temporal summation and aftersensations, which are consistent with more sensitive nociceptive processing rather than higher thresholds [^111SdCGg] [^116NpBGc]. I should confirm that these differences persist when stimuli are calibrated to individual thresholds; when pain intensity is matched, subjective ratings can look similar, but the threshold itself remains lower in women, reinforcing the directionality of the effect [^1166pS49].

> Next, I should review mechanisms that plausibly explain greater sensitivity rather than higher thresholds in women. Biologically, sex hormones modulate nociceptive pathways with complex, context-dependent effects; estrogen can be both pro- and antinociceptive, and androgen signaling appears protective, with preclinical work implicating androgen receptor expression in primary sensory neurons as a regulator of mechanical pain sensitivity, which aligns with higher sensitivity in lower-androgen states or in females [^111oEuaU] [^117RhGEM]. I need to check endogenous pain inhibition as well; conditioned pain modulation and diffuse noxious inhibitory control are often less efficient in women, suggesting weaker descending inhibitory control that would lower thresholds and increase pain facilitation [^11247wTe] [^116GdydQ].

> I will now examine psychological and social contributors. Women tend to report higher pain catastrophizing, which correlates with lower thresholds and greater pain unpleasantness; however, I should confirm that catastrophizing does not fully account for threshold differences — indeed, even after accounting for mood and catastrophizing, sex differences in threshold and tolerance often persist, indicating partial but not complete mediation by cognitive-affective factors [^116jbfDq] [^116PGjKd]. But wait, what if gender role expectations inflate male tolerance or suppress female expression? Studies show gender role expectations can shape pain reporting and tolerance behavior, yet experimental designs that control for these factors still reveal lower thresholds in women, supporting a biological contribution alongside psychosocial modulation [^113F64Wk].

> Let me consider central sensitization, because this could mechanistically link lower thresholds to chronic pain vulnerability. Healthy women show more pronounced experimentally induced central sensitization than men, with both subjective and objective proxies indicating greater spinal and supraspinal hyperexcitability, which would be expected to lower pain thresholds and amplify pain over time [^1114wAvM] [^1123kdAb]. I should confirm that these CS differences are observed in pain-free individuals; yes, studies demonstrate sex differences even in healthy cohorts, suggesting a predisposing substrate for chronic pain in women [^1114wAvM] [^1123kdAb].

> Next, I should review exceptions and conflicting data so I don't overgeneralize. Some studies report no sex difference or even higher female thresholds in specific tasks like ischemic pain tolerance, and menstrual cycle phase can modulate inhibitory processes without consistently changing thresholds, underscoring modality and methodological dependencies [^1165gebf] [^112ENtg3]. Hold on, I should verify clinical relevance too; several large algometry studies argue that average sex differences in pressure pain are small — often less than the minimal clinically important difference — so while statistically detectable, they may be modest at the individual level and dwarfed by factors like central hyperalgesia or chronic pain status [^112B8dXz] [^116ykmyk].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are framed correctly. Women have higher prevalence and severity of many chronic pain conditions, and lower experimental thresholds are consistent with that epidemiology. However, thresholds are not destiny, and psychosocial interventions can improve outcomes, with randomized data showing sex-specific benefits such as improved pain intensity in women and improved pain tolerance in men under a behavioral pain management intervention, highlighting that sex-tailored approaches can be meaningful even when baseline sensitivity differs [^111so2at] [^114QzcpK]. Let me also note that analgesic responses can vary by sex, with some evidence suggesting greater opioid analgesia in women in certain contexts, though findings are heterogeneous and drug-specific, reinforcing the need to individualize treatment rather than assume uniform responses [^1173kceS].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Women do not have a higher pain threshold than men; on average, women have lower pain thresholds and report greater pain sensitivity across multiple experimental modalities, with convergent evidence from systematic reviews, quantitative sensory testing, and psychophysical studies, even though the magnitude can be small and context-dependent [^1165gebf] [^113ufkkQ] [^111SdCGg]. The better-supported inference is that women demonstrate greater pain sensitivity and lower thresholds on average, mediated by hormonal, neurobiological, and psychosocial factors, with central sensitization and endogenous inhibition differences contributing to both experimental findings and clinical pain vulnerability [^111qZCtZ] [^1114wAvM] [^11247wTe].

---

The premise that women have a higher pain threshold than men is **not supported by the evidence** [^111qZCtZ]. In fact, women generally have **lower pain thresholds and tolerance** than men across multiple experimental pain modalities, including pressure, thermal, and electrical stimuli [^113ufkkQ] [^1165gebf]. These differences are modest, vary by modality, and are shaped by biological, hormonal, psychological, and social factors [^112B8dXz] [^1165gebf] [^116MG6Ew]. Clinically, women report more frequent and severe pain and are more likely to have chronic pain conditions, which aligns with their greater pain sensitivity rather than a higher threshold [^111so2at].

---

## Biological and hormonal factors

- **Sex hormones**: Estrogen and progesterone modulate pain pathways, with estrogen generally increasing pain sensitivity, especially during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [^112Zd8oq] [^116f8Sg3].

- **Endogenous opioids**: Women may have less efficient endogenous opioid systems, reducing intrinsic pain inhibition and contributing to lower pain thresholds [^notfound].

- **Genetic factors**: Sex-specific genetic variations influence pain processing, including polymorphisms in opioid and serotonin pathways [^notfound].

---

## Psychological and social factors

- **Pain catastrophizing**: Women report higher pain catastrophizing, which amplifies pain perception and lowers tolerance [^116jbfDq] [^112P359J].

- **Coping strategies**: Women more often use emotion-focused coping, whereas men use distraction or problem-solving, affecting pain reports and tolerance [^114WK4oV] [^116sqLHr].

- **Gender roles**: Societal expectations can shape pain expression, with women often encouraged to express pain and men to suppress it, influencing experimental and clinical reports [^113F64Wk] [^114EC33R].

---

## Experimental evidence

Multiple studies show that women have **lower pain thresholds and tolerance** than men across modalities:

| **Pain modality** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Pressure pain | Lower thresholds in women [^1165gebf] [^111SdCGg] |
| Thermal pain | Lower thresholds and tolerance in women [^113ufkkQ] [^1166pS49] |
| Electrical stimulation | Lower sensory and motor thresholds in women [^117XgLMo] [^111AsHCH] |
| Ischemic pain | Comparable thresholds, lower tolerance in women [^1165gebf] [^11684tPT] |

---

## Clinical implications

Greater pain sensitivity in women is reflected in higher prevalence and severity of chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia, migraines, and osteoarthritis [^113ufkkQ] [^114fTCst]. It also underscores the need for **sex-specific pain management** that considers hormonal, psychological, and social factors [^1114TxpM] [^1144jkhj].

---

## Conclusion

Women do not have a higher pain threshold than men; they generally have **lower pain thresholds and tolerance**, influenced by biological, hormonal, psychological, and social factors [^113ufkkQ]. This greater sensitivity aligns with higher chronic pain prevalence in women and supports tailored pain management strategies [^113dwUHH].

### The association between age at menarche and chronic pain outcomes in women: the troms ø study, 2007 to 2016 [^1114Zu2c]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Sex differences are well established in clinical pain, with women more frequently reporting specific chronic pain conditions than men. Findings in epidemiological research show close to 1.3 times higher prevalence of chronic pain in women.

The causes of sex differences in pain are poorly understood; however, one reason might be the different hormone exposure in the sexes throughout the lifetime. Human experimental studies on pain sensitivity in women have extensively examined responses across the menstrual cycle; thereby, they indirectly investigated the associations between exposure to ovarian hormones and pain thresholds or pain tolerance. Most earlier studies reported the effect of menstrual phase on variation in pain sensitivity, with menstrual phase reflecting the fluctuating levels of estrogen across the cycle. However, the estrogen level was merely determined by the self-reported menstrual phase instead of the direct measurement of ovarian hormones. More recent studies have failed to replicate these findings. Thus, there is no clear evidence of whether experimental pain varies across the menstrual cycle in healthy women. Although menstrual cycle studies assess the immediate effects of sex hormones, this design does not assess the consequences of long-term hormonal exposure that commences in prepuberty and persists throughout the reproductive span. There is a strong need for population-based studies to assess sex hormones during puberty and the impact of lifetime hormonal exposure on pain sensitivity and chronic pain.

Early menarche is associated with higher circulating estrogen levels during puberty, across the menstrual cycle, and the levels remain increased for several years after puberty. Therefore, early menarche may serve as a proxy measure of increased estrogen exposure during developmental period. Early menarche has an established clinical relevance in oncology, serving as a risk factor of hormone-related cancers, such as breast cancer. Four studies have assessed associations between age at menarche and site-specific pain: headache, pelvic girdle syndrome in pregnancy, migraine, and chronic lower back and upper extremity pain. In addition, one study examined the association between age at menarche and chronic widespread pain in adults, and one study examined the association with chronic nonspecific pain in teenagers. Although effect sizes and statistical significance varied, all 6 studies concluded that early menarche was associated with increased pain prevalence.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^112B8dXz]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Threshold algometry studies comparing the kilopascal of healthy participants found that women were anywhere from equally sensitive to two times more sensitive to pain pressure than men.,-Studies comparing the seconds of tolerance of a constant pressure were in the same range. Generally, the difference between women and men seems smaller than the variance within the same gender.

Our findings are in line with previous findings and exactly the same as in a previous meta-analysis, as our women were 1.1 to 1.3 times more pressure sensitive than our men. The differences between women and men observed in previous studies were usually statistically significant, despite similar and often even smaller differences than in our study, and there were only a few exceptions. On one hand, this is surprising, as our study was larger than most previous studies. On the other hand, the detailed pictures we draw require more power than a mere comparison of means.

The women / men ratio of 1.3, as observed in finger algometry, translates to only a third point on an analogue pain rating scale from zero to ten. In more sensitive measurement locations, such as ear lobe algometry, the ratio diminishes to 1.1 or less and remains a third point on an analogue pain rating scale from zero to ten, regardless of age. For analogue pain rating scale, MCID must be approximately two points or 30% to reach clinical importance. This reflects the negligibility of differences.

Numeric and visual analogue scales have the advantage that their MCID are known. Visual analogue scales are plain with horizontal lines and only the ends have anchors. Respondents place a mark at some point on the line. On a 100 millimeter visual analogue scale, the smallest unit is one millimeter, which would allow to be more precise than with a numeric analogue scale; perhaps overly precise, namely more precise than the true discriminant ability of the patients. For both scales, the absolute MCID is around 20% of the entire range. If visual and numeric rating behaved equally, pain-free volunteers would have a 10mm average. This would mean men differed from women by 10% to 30%, which would translate to one to three millimeters. With sufficient sample size, even that difference would be statistically significant. To verify this assumption, we would like to encourage further studies on quantitative sensory testing of pain to use numeric analogue scales, as we did, as well as visual analogue scales, as nobody has done to date to our knowledge.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^114ejPhc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Most threshold algometry studies focused on kilopascal or kilograms per square centimeter. Few studies kept the pressure constant over time and measured the time to the defined sensation. As a definition of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is missing for threshold algometry, it is unknown if the sex- or age-dependent differences are meaningful or not.

Although analogue pain rating is the most popular pain assessment tool in research of disease-caused pain and the patients consider it the most relevant outcome, it is rare in quantitative sensory testing of pain and completely missing in investigations of age and sex differences.–This is puzzling, since it is easier to put a peg on a patient´s finger or ear lobe than increasing the pressure constantly with a standard handheld algometer. Experimental studies showed that human delivery of pressure varies considerably during extended applications with these devices. An advantage of analogue rating is that the MCID is defined for a zero to ten analogue pain rating scale; a change or difference is clinically relevant if it is at least two points, or 30% of the initial value. Additionally, the maximal range of analogue pain rating is defined. Interpreting sex and age differences in relation to a maximal range makes it easier to decide how meaningful they are.

We answered the question whether the increased pain sensitivity of women and elderly is quantitatively meaningful. We did this by quantifying pain sensitivity as fluctuating age- and sex-dependent percentile curves of numeric ratings within a range of zero to ten. The use of percentile curves is more precise than simple mean comparisons or linear regressions, which is a further innovation of this study.

### Sex, gender, and pain: an overview of a complex field [^111h79Cm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Traditionally, biomedical research in the field of pain has been conducted with male animals and subjects. Over the past 20–30 yr, it has been increasingly recognized that this narrow approach has missed an important variable: sex. An ever-increasing number of studies have established sex differences in response to pain and analgesics. These studies have demonstrated that the differences between the sexes appear to have a biological and psychological basis. We will provide brief review of the epidemiology, rodent, and human experimental findings. The controversies and widespread disagreement in the literature highlight the need for a progressive approach to the questions involving collaborative efforts between those trained in the basic and clinical biomedical sciences and those in the epidemiological and social sciences. In order for patients suffering from acute and/or chronic pain to benefit from this work, the approach has to involve the use or development of clinically relevant models of nociception or pain to answer the basic, but complex, question. The present state of the literature allows no translation of the work to our clinical decision-making.

### Exploring the difference between men and women in physical functioning: how do sociodemographic, lifestyle-and health-related determinants contribute? [^111sYCcY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Differences between men and women in exposure

The largest effect of a difference between men and women in exposure was found for pain: a larger sex difference was observed in the multivariable model including the determinant pain (-5.41, 95%CI: -6.41,-4.42) compared to the model without pain (-3.28, 95%CI:-4.13,-2.43) Table 4. So, adjusting for pain decreased the sex difference by (2.13/3.28) 65.0%, therefore pain contributes to the more reported limitations in physical functioning among women. In addition, women more often had a low educational level, no paid job and were alcohol abstainers, each decreasing around 10% of the beta for the sex difference in physical functioning and therefore contributing. In contrast, men were on average more exposed to a higher BMI and lower levels of physical activity compared to women, contributing to more reported limitations in physical functioning among men and therefore suppressing the sex difference.

Table 4
Multivariable model: Difference between men and women in exposure to determinants of physical functioning

Abbreviations: 95%CI = 95% Confidence Interval, BMI = Body Mass Index

Note: Each row represents the full model including all variables, age, age2 and sex excluding the indicated variable (-)

Note: Bold is significant (percentage change > 5%)

a Represents the sex difference (women versus men) in physical functioning

b Percentage change = 1 — (Beta "sex" full model minus indicated variable / Beta "sex" full model), interpretation: A negative percentage change means this factor (partly) explains the lower physical functioning score among women compared to men (i.e. the sex difference decreases when adjusted for this determinant) and a positive percentage change suggest that this factor supresses the lower physical functioning score among women compared to men because after the adjustment the sex difference increases

### Gender role expectations of pain: relationship to experimental pain perception [^114EC33R]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of an individual's Gender Role Expectations of Pain (GREP) on experimental pain report. One hundred and forty-eight subjects (87 females and 61 males) subjects underwent thermal testing and were asked to report pain threshold, pain tolerance, VAS ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness, and a computerized visual analogue scales (VAS) rating of pain intensity during the procedure. Subjects completed the GREP questionnaire to assess sex-related stereotypic attributions of pain sensitivity, pain endurance, and willingness to report pain. Consistent with previous research, significant sex differences emerged for measures of pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain unpleasantness. After statistically controlling for age, GREP scores were significant predictors of threshold, tolerance, and pain unpleasantness, accounting for an additional 7, 11, and 21% of the variance, respectively. Sex remained a significant predictor of pain tolerance in hierarchical regression analyses after controlling for GREP scores. Results provide support for two competing but not mutually exclusive hypotheses related to the sex differences in experimental pain. Both psychosocial factors and first-order, biological sex differences remain as viable explanations for differences in experimental pain report between the sexes. It appears that GREP do play a part in determining an individual's pain report and may be contributing to the sex differences in the laboratory setting.

### Sex-specific impact of early-life adversity on chronic pain: a large population-based study in Japan [^116A13qy]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Early-life adversity (ELA) is defined as traumatic experiences during childhood encompassing maltreatment, accidents, death of a close relative, and disaster, any of which could have an influence not only in childhood but also in later life in the form of difficulties such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or irritable bowel syndrome. Previous studies have also described the relationship between ELA events and chronic pain (e.g. low back pain or fibromyalgia), but most of these studies were small-scale or targeted to North American, European, Oceanian populations,–and once targeted to Japanese population.

This study focuses on the effects of ELA as a broader concept in relation to chronic pain. We used a question about adverse life events in general, rather than specific adversities.

Various sex or gender differences in tolerance for stressful life events have been documented. For example, a meta-analytic review revealed that women reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety than did men, but that the sex difference in psychological symptoms accounted for only about 4% of the variance in sex differences in reports of stress. Sex or gender differences as they relate to chronic pain have been discussed for decades. The prevalence of chronic pain among women is higher than that among men, and somatic symptoms have been reported by women than by men.

We hypothesized that ELA would have long-term adverse impact, which manifested as chronic pain on more women than men, so we investigated the sex-specific association between ELA and the prevalence of chronic pain, chronic multisite pain, and somatizing tendency complicated by chronic pain in a large population-based study of Japanese men and women aged 20–79 years.

### Laboratory pain perception and clinical pain in post-menopausal women and age-matched men with osteoarthritis: relationship to pain coping and hormonal status [^116PGjKd]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

The present study examined relationships between pain coping, hormone replacement therapy, and laboratory and clinical pain reports in post-menopausal women and age-matched men with osteoarthritis. Assessment of nociceptive flexion reflex threshold was followed by an assessment of electrocutaneous pain threshold and tolerance. Participants rated their arthritis pain using the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. To assess pain coping, participants completed measures of emotion-focused coping, problem-focused coping, and pain catastrophizing. Results indicated that women were more likely than men to report using emotion-focused pain strategies, and that emotion-focused coping was associated with more arthritic pain and lower electrocutaneous pain tolerance. Correlations between coping measures and pain reports revealed that catastrophizing was associated with greater arthritis pain and lower pain threshold and tolerance levels. However, catastrophizing was not related to nociceptive flexion reflex threshold, suggesting that the observed relationship between catastrophizing and subjective pain does not rely on elevated nociceptive input. A comparison of men (n = 58), post-menopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy (n = 32), and post-menopausal women not receiving hormone replacement therapy (n = 42) revealed no significant group differences in arthritis pain, electrocutaneous pain threshold or tolerance, or nociceptive flexion reflex threshold. Thus, older adults with osteoarthritis do not exhibit the pattern of sex differences in response to experimental pain procedures observed in prior studies, possibly due to the development of disease-related changes in pain coping strategies. Accordingly, individual differences in clinical and experimental pain may be better predicted by pain coping than by sex or hormonal differences.

### Group differences in pain modulation: pain-free women compared to pain-free men and to women with TMD [^114mCTMp]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

Previously reported differences in sensitivity to experimental pain stimuli between the sexes, as well as between temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients and healthy control subjects, may be attributable in part to group differences in two pain modulatory mechanisms: the baroreceptor reflex arc and the endogenous opioid system. Twenty-two pain-free (PF) men, 20 PF women and 20 women with TMD underwent two testing sessions in which heat pain and ischemic arm pain threshold and tolerance were measured during both sessions, but followed relaxation during one session and laboratory stress tasks during the other. Blood pressure (BP) and plasma -endorphin (E) concentration were measured during a baseline rest and during the stress or relaxation periods. PF men's threshold and tolerance for heat pain, but not for ischemic pain, exceeded that of PF women's during both sessions. PF women and TMD women did not differ in sensitivity to either pain modality; however, significantly lower ischemic pain threshold (IPTh) was linked to oral contraceptive use in PF women but not TMD patients. In the men alone, higher baseline systolic BP (SBP) was correlated with higher heat pain threshold on both days and heat pain tolerance on the stress day. Conversely, in TMD women, higher baseline SBP was correlated with lower ischemic pain tolerance (IPTol) on both days; BP and pain sensitivity were not related in PF women. In men, but not in PF or TMD women, stress systolic and diastolic BP were positively correlated with heat pain threshold and tolerance and higher diastolic reactivity to stress were correlated with higher heat pain and IPTh and tolerance. On the stress day, higher baseline E level was strongly associated with higher IPTol in PF women but marginally associated with lower IPTol in TMD women. Thus, it appears that a BP-related analgesic mechanism (probably baroreceptor-mediated) predominates in PF men, while an endogenous opioid mechanism predominates in PF women. Stress enhances the expression of these central mechanisms. Female TMDs appear unable to effectively engage normal pain-inhibitory systems; opioid receptor desensitization and/or downregulation are probably implicated, because TMDs' production of E appears normal.

### Healthy women show more experimentally induced central sensitization compared with men [^1123kdAb]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

4.5. Potential implications for chronic pain

Central sensitization is suggested as one important factor governing the transition from acute to chronic pain in certain clinical conditions. The present findings of more pronounced CS processes in healthy women compared with men at supraspinal and spinal levels indicate that CS might be more important for the development and maintenance of chronic pain in women compared with men. This hypothesis would be in line with the observed higher prevalence of certain chronic pain conditions exhibiting ongoing CS processes in women, such as fibromyalgia, knee osteoarthritis, headache disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders. The present findings thus underscore that sex-specific CS differences should be taken into account when (1) characterizing aetiology in chronic pain and (2) improving therapeutic approaches in patients in the future, expanding previous recommendations.

Because only a subgroup of chronic pain conditions with CS predominantly affects women, further research should be directed at understanding which additional contributors might influence CS processes to potentially become a driving factor in chronic pain. Separate assessment of supraspinal and spinal mechanisms that both influence the resulting pain phenotype, could be considered a first step in this direction. Although there are no pure supraspinal nor pure spinal readouts in humans, this was attempted here by distinguishing subjective from objective CS proxies. The fact that the 2 proxies differed to different degrees between men and women suggests that they might be differentially influenced by spinal and supraspinal mechanisms.

### Role of gender norms and group identification on hypothetical and experimental pain tolerance [^113F64Wk]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Previous research indicates that men typically tolerate more pain in experimental settings than women. One likely explanation for these group differences in pain tolerance is conformity to traditional, gender group social norms (i.e., the ideal man is masculine and tolerates more pain; the ideal woman is feminine and tolerates less pain). According to self-categorization theory, norms guide behavior to the degree that group members adopt the group identity. Therefore, high-identifying men are expected to conform to gender norms and tolerate more pain than high-identifying women who conform to different gender norms as a guide for their behavior. We conducted two studies to investigate whether gender group identification moderates individuals' conformity to pain tolerance and reporting norms. In the first study, participants indicated their gender identification and expected tolerance of a hypothetical painful stimulus. As anticipated, high-identifying men reported significantly greater pain tolerance than high-identifying women. No differences existed between low-identifying men and women. To determine if self-reported pain tolerance in a role-playing scenario corresponds to actual pain tolerance in an experimental setting, the second study examined pain tolerance to a noxious stimulus induced by electrical stimulation of the index finger. The experimental outcome revealed that high-identifying men tolerated more painful stimulation than high-identifying women. Further, high-identifying men tolerated more pain than low-identifying men. These results highlight the influence of social norms on behavior and suggest the need to further explore the role of norms in pain reporting behaviors.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^111BWefq]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

On the ear lobe, the difference between the medians of women and men reached 1.6 units on the analogue pain rating scale within the interval from 40 to 50 years, which is clinically not meaningful. Outside of this age interval, the 95% confidence bands overlapped, showing again low statistical significance (Figure 6).

Figure 6
Pressure sensitivity on the ear lobe in 347 women compared to 301 men. Provided that our sample is representative, the medians split the individuals of the respective gender in two equally large groups. The middle lines are our estimates, and the 95% confidence bands indicate their statistical precision. Due to the smaller number of individuals, the gender-specific confidence bands are wider than the overall confidence bands. They are wider than one unit. The difference between men and women ranged between zero and 1.6 measurement units. The largest difference in pressure sensitivity between men and women is between 40 and 50 years. During this period, the sensitivity of both sexes increases. The absolute minimal clinically important difference for zero to ten numeric rating scales is at least two measurement units, and the relative minimal clinically important difference is 30%. In other words, the difference between women and men is not meaningful.

### Mediators of pain and physical function in female and male patients with chronic pain [^111og5fT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical and experimental studies have documented that women are more prone to pain compared with men.–The sex hormones play a role and the effect seems to be regulated by immunological mediators. However, chronic pain is a complex condition and several psychosocial characteristics have been identified as risk factors,–and these may also explain the gender-related differences.–

Comorbidity of pain and depressive symptoms is associated with poorer prognosis and more disability than either condition alone, and this is found to be more pronounced among women compared with men. In a review, including 105 epidemiological studies of recurrent pain, women experienced more recurrent pain, longer pain duration, more severe pain intensity, and they were more vulnerable to psychosocial factors than men. In an epidemiological Canadian survey based on data from a national database with more than 131 000 adults, depressive symptoms and chronic pain were twice as prevalent in women as in men, and comorbidity of depression and pain was significantly associated with psychological distress and disability among women. In another large population-based study from 13 European countries, women with chronic pain were also more prone to report depressive symptoms than men with chronic pain. Treatment of depressive symptoms interestingly seemed to protect from persistent pain among women but not among men. When Keefe et al in pre-treatment data from two randomized, clinical treatment studies (N: 168) found relatively higher pain levels and worse physical function among women than men suffering from osteoarthritis, catastrophizing thoughts mediated the relation between gender and pain outcomes.

### Inflammation-induced pain sensitization in men and women: does sex matter in experimental endotoxemia? [^1141Fibm]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

A role of the innate immune system is increasingly recognized as a mechanism contributing to pain sensitization. Experimental administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constitutes a model to study inflammation-induced pain sensitization, but all existing human evidence comes from male participants. We assessed visceral and musculoskeletal pain sensitivity after low-dose LPS administration in healthy men and women to test the hypothesis that women show greater LPS-induced hyperalgesia compared with men. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, healthy men (n = 20) and healthy women using oral contraceptives (n = 20) received an intravenous injection of 0.4 ng/kg body weight LPS or placebo. Pain sensitivity was assessed with established visceral and musculoskeletal pain models (ie, rectal pain thresholds; pressure pain thresholds for different muscle groups), together with a heartbeat perception (interoceptive accuracy) task. Plasma cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) were measured along with state anxiety at baseline and up to 6-hour postinjection. Lipopolysaccharide application led to significant increases in plasma cytokines and state anxiety and decreased interoceptive awareness in men and women (P < 0.001, condition effects), with more pronounced LPS-induced cytokine increases in women (P < 0.05, interaction effects). Although both rectal and pressure pain thresholds were significantly decreased in the LPS condition (all P < 0.05, condition effect), no sex differences in endotoxin-induced sensitization were observed. In summary, LPS-induced systemic immune activation leads to visceral and musculoskeletal hyperalgesia, irrespective of biological sex. These findings support the broad applicability of experimental endotoxin administration as a translational preclinical model of inflammation-induced pain sensitization in both sexes.

### Gender, coping and the perception of pain [^114WK4oV]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

Research consistently indicates that gender differences exist in pain perception, with females typically reporting more negative responses to pain than males. It also seems as if males and females use and benefit from different coping strategies when under stress; females seem to prefer emotion-focused coping, whereas males prefer sensory-focused coping. Unfortunately, experimental research that examines such differences in the context of pain has not yet been adequately investigated. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to determine whether gender differences would be found in the effect that sensory-focused and emotion-focused coping instructions have on cold pressor pain experiences. Participants consisted of 24 male and 26 female healthy adults, all of whom reported no current pain. A consistent pattern of effects was found, over both behavioural and self-report measures of pain. Compared to females, males exhibited less negative pain responses when focusing on the sensory component of pain (i.e. increased threshold, tolerance and lower sensory pain). Furthermore, compared to sensory focusing, emotional focusing was found to increase the affective pain experience of females. Together these results confirm that important differences exist between men and women in the effects pain coping instructions have on the experience of pain. The implications of such findings for research and practice are discussed.

### Gender differences in pain modulation by diffuse noxious inhibitory controls: a systematic review [^116GdydQ]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, extensive research has demonstrated sex differences in pain perception and modulation. Several factors have been proposed to account for the differences observed between men and women, including pain modulation through diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC). Studies investigating sex differences in DNIC have shown mixed results, with some reporting decreased DNIC effect in women compared with men, while others found no difference in DNIC between the sexes. Additional studies have investigated DNIC in both sexes without focusing on sex differences. This systematic review aimed to answer the following question: "In humans of reproductive age without chronic pain, are women more likely than men to have decreased Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls?" Relevant studies were identified by computerized searches of Pubmed/Medline, Embase, Biosis, Web of Science, PsycInfo and Cochrane (from January 1980 through February 2009). The search was limited to human studies with no language restriction. The initial search identified 718 titles and abstracts. Seventeen studies were included in the final stage and data regarding age and gender of participants, methodology and outcome measurements were extracted and analyzed. The majority of studies using pain report as the outcome found significantly more efficient DNIC in males than females (mean female/male ratio = 0.54). Studies evaluating pain thresholds and nociceptive flexion reflex indicated the opposite when simply averaged across studies; however, weighted analyses of threshold found more efficient DNIC in males. Gender differences in DNIC effect depend on both the experimental methodology and the modes of measurement of the effect.

### Gender differences in pain and healthcare utilization for adult sickle cell patients: the PiSCES project [^114LFpkj]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have found gender differences in frequency and intensity of pain. Women often report lower pain thresholds, higher pain ratings, and lower tolerance for pain. People with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience both chronic and acute pain throughout life.

Objectives

To compare adult men and women with SCD in terms of reported pain, crises, healthcare utilization, and opioid usage.

Methods

Two hundred twenty-six adults with SCD in Virginia were enrolled in a prospective cohort study of pain and completed daily diaries for 1–6 months. Subjects reported for the previous day their maximum SCD-related pain, distress, and interference (0–9 scale), whether they were in a sickle cell crisis, had unplanned utilization (clinic, emergency room, or hospitalization), or used opioids. Episodes of pain, crisis, or utilization were defined as consecutive days of such. Men and women were compared, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for age, SCD genotype, depression, and education.

Results

There were no significant differences between men and women in the percentage of days subjects experienced pain (men 58.6% vs. women 56.5%) or the number of pain episodes/6 months (7.7 vs. 9.6). Mean pain scores were comparable, when subjects were in crisis (5.5 vs. 5.6) or not (2.5 vs. 2.2). Distress and interference results were similar. Men with the SS genotype reported a higher percentage of days with crisis(18.5% vs. 11.6%) and utilization (5.1% vs. 2.7%) than women with the SS genotype.

Conclusions

Contrary to many studies of pain, particularly chronic pain, men and women with SCD reported generally similar pain experiences.

### Do sex differences exist in opioid analgesia? A systematic review and meta-analysis of human experimental and clinical studies [^1173kceS]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Although a contribution of sex in opioid efficacy has garnered much attention, the confirmation and direction of any such difference remain elusive. We performed a systematic review of the available literature on sex differences in μ and mixed μ/κ opioid effect on acute and experimental pain. Fifty unique studies (including three unpublished studies) were included in the analyses. Across the 25 clinical studies on μ-opioids there was no significant sex-analgesia association. Restricting the analysis to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) studies (irrespective of the opioid) yielded greater analgesia in women (n = 15, effect size 0.22, 95% c.i. 0.02–0.42, P = 0.028). Further restricting the analysis to PCA morphine studies yielded an even greater effect in women (n = 11, effect size = 0.36, 95% c.i. 0.17–0.56, P = 0.003). Meta-regression indicated that the longer the duration of PCA, the difference in effect between the sexes further increased. Across experimental pain studies on μ-opioids women had greater antinociception from opioids (n = 11, effect size = 0.35; 95% c.i. 0.01–0.69, P = 0.047), which was predominantly due to 6 morphine studies. Female patients had greater μ/κ opioid analgesia (n = 7, effect size 0.84; 95% c.i. 0.25–1.43, P = 0.005), but no sex-analgesia association was present in experimental studies (n = 7). Sex differences exist in morphine-induced analgesia in both experimental pain studies and clinical PCA studies, with greater morphine efficacy in women. The data on non-morphine μ and mixed μ/κ-opioids are less convincing and require further study.

### Pain rating schema: three distinct subgroups of individuals emerge when rating mild, moderate, and severe pain [^1128BQkz]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

The ranges of VAS intensities reported by our community sample for mild, moderate, and severe pain are consistent with previous cross-sectional studies in patient populations, some of which were based on pain interference scores. For example, mild pain has typically encompassed ratings from 1 to 3,–or 1 to 4,–which is similar to the fifth to 95th percentile range of 1.1 to 5.0 in our cohort, despite the between-study differences in collection and statistical methodologies.

However, our results would suggest that single "cutpoints" to differentiate numerical pain ratings into categorical levels may not adequately reflect the individual differences associated with decision-making and the underlying cognitive approach used to evaluate the numerical pain scales. Indeed, approximately one-third of the study cohort (ie, the High Rating subgroup) rated mildly painful conditions as nearly twice as painful on the 10 cm VAS as the remaining two-thirds of individuals (Low Rating and Low/High Rating subgroups). Further, this High Rating subgroup rated mild severities higher than or equal to the moderate severities rated by the other two subgroups. Thus, clinicians or researchers who assign cutpoints to numerical pain ratings to translate them into mild, moderate, or severe severity categories may misinterpret an individual's pain experience.

We did not see a significant difference between males and females in pain rating schema. This is consistent with a recent review indicating little to no sex differences in several assessments of pain sensitivity. Our findings also suggest that previously observed sex differences in pain tolerance, ie, for thermaland cold pressor pain, are not simply due to a difference in pain rating schema – sex differences in tolerance are more likely a result of underlying physiological differences (eg, in subcutaneous fat layers) or social–behavioral differences, where men may be more reluctant to "quit" a pain tolerance task. Indeed, gender roles and expectations have accounted for the sex differences in pain ratings in prior studies.

The most notable difference between the clusters was how individuals rated their existing pain intensity: Individuals in the Low Rating cluster rated "current" pain the lowest of all three clusters. This is consistent with their observed pain cluster schema, which was to use the lowest half of the numerical range available. However, it is impossible to differentiate whether these differences in existing pain were due to: 1) less noxious painful stimuli; 2) lower pain sensitivity; 3) their underlying pain rating schema used to communicate their pain; or 4) some combination of these three.

### The association of hormone replacement therapy with experimental pain responses in postmenopausal women [^112Zd8oq]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Considerable experimental research suggests that ovarian hormones can influence pain perception, and recent epidemiologic and clinical research suggests that exogenous hormone use may influence the prevalence and severity of clinical pain among women. However, to date no studies have examined the influence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on experimental pain responses and recent pain complaints among postmenopausal women. In this study, self-reported recent pain and general health were obtained, and thermal pain responses were assessed in three groups of healthy older adults: (1) women on HRT, (2) women not on HRT (No-HRT), and (3) men. Results indicated no group differences in recent pain complaints or self-reported health, but differences emerged for measures of thermal pain perception. Specifically, HRT women showed lower pain thresholds and tolerances than No-HRT women and men, and the latter two groups did not differ from each other. The potential explanations and limitations of the observed findings are discussed.

### Sex differences in pain and pain inhibition: multiple explanations of a controversial phenomenon [^111qZCtZ]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

A clear majority of patients with chronic pain are women; however, it has been surprisingly difficult to determine whether this sex bias corresponds to actual sex differences in pain sensitivity. A survey of the currently available epidemiological and laboratory data indicates that the evidence for clinical and experimental sex differences in pain is overwhelming. Various explanations for this phenomenon have been given, ranging from experiential and sociocultural differences in pain experience between men and women to hormonally and genetically driven sex differences in brain neurochemistry.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^111SdCGg]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sex and age differences tickle the fancy of physicians, researchers, and the general population, especially when it comes to the question of who is more sensitive. Several findings suggest that women experience pain more intensely than men. They include pressure, thermal, and ischemic pain. Investigations on age using mechanical pressure and ischemic pain stimuli have reported decreased pain thresholds in older age.–

A review of 172 studies found that with sufficient statistical power, pressure pain thresholds were lower in women than in men. Further results confirmed this difference, but its magnitude is substantially inconsistent. The differences vary between 5% up to 100%. Equally inconsistent are the thresholds within the same gender and even within the same measurement location between studies. This inconsistency might be due to the measuring methods. Quantitative sensory testing of pain is feasible by methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging on one hand (nociceptive representation) while the patient is reporting the outcome on the other hand (magnitude estimation). While the first method is more "objective" and precise, the second method is more "subjective" and relevant to the patients. For the second method, it is possible to measure the kilopascals, or seconds, to a threshold, for instance until a stimulus is perceived as painful, respectively tolerable (threshold algometry), or to rate the intensity of the stimulus on an analogue scale (analogue pain rating).

### Alfentanil and placebo analgesia: no sex differences detected in models of experimental pain [^114AWMBe]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

To assess whether patient sex contributes to the interindividual variability in alfentanil analgesic sensitivity, the authors compared male and female subjects for pain sensitivity after alfentanil using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling approach.

Methods

Healthy volunteers received a 30-min alfentanil or placebo infusion on two occasions. Analgesia was measured during the subsequent 6 h by assaying tolerance to transcutaneous electrical stimulation (eight men and eight women) of increasing intensity or using visual analog scale scores during treatment with noxious thermal heat (five men and five women). Sedation was concomitantly measured. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were applied to the analgesia and sedation data using NONMEM. For electrical pain, the placebo and alfentanil models were combined post hoc.

Results

Alfentanil and placebo analgesic responses did not differ between sexes. The placebo effect was successfully incorporated into the alfentanil pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model and was responsible for 20% of the potency of alfentanil. However, the placebo effect did not contribute to the analgesic response variability. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of the electrical and heat pain data yielded similar values for the potency parameter, but the blood-effect site equilibration half-life was significantly longer for electrical pain (7–9 min) than for heat pain (0.2 min) or sedation (2 min).

Conclusions

In contrast to the ample literature demonstrating sex differences in morphine analgesia, neither sex nor subject expectation (i.e., placebo) contributes to the large between-subject response variability with alfentanil analgesia. The difference in alfentanil analgesia onset and offset between pain tests is discussed.

### Validation of the Norwegian pain sensitivity questionnaire [^114JF8n6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

As confounding variables also may contribute to the experience of pain, a regression analysis was performed with the three experimental measures of pain used as dependent variable. As shown in Table 3, only gender influenced the experimental pain threshold as the male participants had statistically significant higher heat pain threshold than women. Only PSQ contributed to explain the experimental pain intensity and pain tolerance.

### Sex differences in fear of pain: item-level analysis of the fear of pain questionnaire III [^114fd78C]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

One possible explanation of the observed sex difference in fear of Severe Pain is that some of the items might reflect psychological measures other than FOP in females. An increasing number of studies have shown that pain and psychological measures such as fear and anxiety are closely related, and that their association with, or relationship to, pain may differ between males and females. While anxiety has been found to increase pain in both sexes, the association between pain and anxiety is stronger in males than in females. Accordingly, higher levels of anxiety are more strongly associated with higher levels of pain in males than in females. In chronic pain patients, overall anxiety sensitivity is higher in females than in males, but males have higher levels of pain-related anxiety, than females. Furthermore, high levels of FOP reduce pain tolerance in females, but not in males. This could explain why females express higher levels of stress, anxiety, and increased negative affect compared to males, and may be relevant for understanding the findings from this study. In our sample, females scored significantly higher than males on the Severe Pain subscale. We hypothesized that the Severe Pain subscale items could have been interpreted or understood differently in males and females, possibly due to divergent levels of overall anxiety and pain-related anxiety. This may in turn have produced the observed sex differences. Some of the most contrasting effects between males and females were found in their responses to Severe Pain subscale items, which included item 1 ("automobile accident"), 13 ("breaking your neck"), and 25 ("having a terminal illness causing daily pain"). Females' responses to these items might reflect more symptoms of anxiety rather than FOP itself. Previous studies have reported that females are, for example, more afraid of dying compared to males. Therefore, females may be more fearful of serious incidents, and thereby respond with higher FOP than males to such items. Females' responses to these items might therefore more accurately reflect higher levels of anxiety than FOP. Thus, the Severe Pain subscale may potentially measure something other than FOP in females than in males, such as fear of dying, fear of being disabled, overall anxiety, or existential anxiety. This study defined fear and anxiety as related constructs, but with some distinctions. The findings of higher levels of severe FOP in females, might be related to the interpretation of the Severe Pain subscale items. For example, "Being in an automobile accident", "Having a heavy object hit you in the head", "Breaking your neck", and "Having a terminal illness that causes you daily pain" might not only represent FOP. Such items could also elicit anxiety related to the consequences and implications these serious happenings might have effect on, for example, familial factors and caregiver responsibilities.

### Needs and wishes towards sex-and gender-sensitive chronic pain management: a qualitative study with German general practitioners [^115TB5Xr]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Empathy and communication skills were deemed critical for addressing the complexity of chronic pain management:

Willingness to engage in conversation, empathy, and the time you can and need to dedicate to such patients are crucial for improving their situation. (Interview 4, male, 45 years)

One GP emphasized the importance of an open and nonjudgmental approach:

I hear from patients that they feel judged — whether for being overweight or other perceived shortcomings. That's something I find completely inappropriate, as any sense of judgment negatively impacts the doctor-patient relationship. (Interview 5, female, 46 years)

The Role of Sex and Gender in Pain Therapy: It's All About the Nuances

After gaining an overview of the daily practice with patients suffering from CNCP receiving LTOT, we then explore the role of sex and gender in this context. The findings are divided into two sections: Influence of patients' sex and gender on medical care and Influence of GPs' sex and gender on medical care.

Influence of Patients' Sex and Gender on Medical Care

To begin with, we asked the interviewees whether they observed differences in how men and women perceive and present illnesses. Various perspectives were shared. One GP described women as "not complaining so often, rather more stoic compared to men" (Interview 1, male, 70 years).

Another GP described more in detail how he perceived differences between men and women in terms of pain tolerance:

Visceral pain is generally tolerated much better by women, as are tumor-related pains. In contrast, I have observed in practice that spinal pain, for instance, or bone pain, tends to be less well tolerated by women compared to men. On the whole, when women perceive pain more acutely, it is often expressed in a way that appears more suffering than in men. (Interview 3, male, 59 years)

### Low pain tolerance is associated with coronary angiography, coronary artery disease, and mortality: the troms ø study [^115Y7vpT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Incidence Rates and HR for Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease According to Pain Tolerance: The Tromsø Study

Among participants referred to coronary angiography, women with low pain tolerance had a 54% increased risk of obstructive CAD (HR 1.54 [95% CI, 1.09–2.18]) compared with women with high pain tolerance, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. There was no association in men (Table 2). The interaction term for sex was significant (P = 0.05). Among women with obstructive CAD, low pain tolerance was associated with nonsignificant higher risk of 3‐vessel and/or left main stem disease (HR, 1.99 [95% CI, 0.96–4.13]). Low pain tolerance was not associated with nonobstructive CAD (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83–1.28]).

Pain Tolerance and Mortality

A total of 700 participants died (7.3%): 385 men (8.7%) and 315 women (6.1%). The cause of death was available until 2017 for 590 participants, of which 19% was because of cardiovascular disease (69 men and 44 women). Other main causes of death were cancer (51%), injury (8%), respiratory disease (6%), and neurological disease (6%). Overall, the IR of death was 6.4 (95% CI, 5.8–7.0) in participants with high pain tolerance and 8.7 (95% CI, 7.7–9.8) in participants with low pain tolerance (P < 0.01). Adjusted for sex and age as time‐scale, participants with low pain tolerance had 39% higher risk of death than participants with high pain tolerance (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.19–1.63]) (Figure S1).

### Effects of vicarious pain on self-pain perception: investigating the role of awareness [^115qW3hg]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Replication of gender and correlational findings

Independent t -tests on baseline data replicated findings of significant differences for genders, with males showing overall decreased sensitivity to cold-pain with increased tolerance and decreased evaluations compared to females (Table 2).

Further replicating prior studiescorrelational analyses confirmed that PSQ scores showed significant moderate positive correlations with intensity and unpleasantness ratings, but not tolerance (Table 3). Similarly, significant positive correlations between intensity and unpleasantness ratingsas well as negative correlations between pain tolerance and both pain evaluationswere replicated.

In contrast to baseline data, difference scores in pain measurements from baseline to trial were not affected by gender (all p > 0.1), pain sensitivity (all p > 0.1) or age (all p > 0.1). Accordingly, within-subject changes in pain perception were not impacted by such factors. Thus, these variables were not included as covariates in the main analyses.

### Gender differences in acute and chronic pain in the emergency department: results of the 2014 academic emergency medicine consensus conference pain section [^114TCAqn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pain is a leading public health problem in the United States, with an annual economic burden of more than $630 billion, and is one of the most common reasons that individuals seek emergency department (ED) care. There is a paucity of data regarding sex differences in the assessment and treatment of acute and chronic pain conditions in the ED. The Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference convened in Dallas, Texas, in May 2014 to develop a research agenda to address this issue among others related to sex differences in the ED. Prior to the conference, experts and stakeholders from emergency medicine and the pain research field reviewed the current literature and identified eight candidate priority areas. At the conference, these eight areas were reviewed and all eight were ratified using a nominal group technique to build consensus. These priority areas were: 1) gender differences in the pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for pain, including differences in opioid tolerance, side effects, or misuse; 2) gender differences in pain severity perceptions, clinically meaningful differences in acute pain, and pain treatment preferences; 3) gender differences in pain outcomes of ED patients across the life span; 4) gender differences in the relationship between acute pain and acute psychological responses; 5) the influence of physician-patient gender differences and characteristics on the assessment and treatment of pain; 6) gender differences in the influence of acute stress and chronic stress on acute pain responses; 7) gender differences in biological mechanisms and molecular pathways mediating acute pain in ED populations; and 8) gender differences in biological mechanisms and molecular pathways mediating chronic pain development after trauma, stress, or acute illness exposure. These areas represent priority areas for future scientific inquiry, and gaining understanding in these will be essential to improving our understanding of sex and gender differences in the assessment and treatment of pain conditions in emergency care settings.

### Sex-based differences in pain perception and treatment [^116f8Sg3]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This review highlights research on sex-based differences in pain perception and treatment. We sought to illuminate the complex factors contributing to differences in pain and analgesic responses between males and females, ranging from psychosocial to biological processes.

Design

We reviewed published studies of pain induction by chemical, electric, heat, surgical, or psychological means, and opioid and nonopioid analgesia comparing responses in men and women.

Results

A substantial body of research indicates that women experience greater clinical pain, suffer greater pain-related distress, and show heightened sensitivity to experimentally induced pain compared with men. Research on sex-based differences in the pain experience and treatment is beginning to uncover patterns that may enable tailoring of pain treatment to individual characteristics. The factors underpinning sex differences in the experience of pain are multifactorial and complex; for example, psychosocial factors such as pain-related catastrophizing may explain sex-based differences in reporting certain types of pain, as women tend to use catastrophizing to a greater degree. Gonadal hormone levels in cycling women also have a substantial impact on pain perception and analgesic response. Women perceive more pain during the luteal phase, and estrogen antagonists provide long-term pain relief in certain situations.

Conclusions

Collectively, greater understanding of the factors that commonly and differentially affect the disparity in pain perception, as well as analgesic response, are beginning to illuminate research targets and promising areas of therapeutic intervention for improved pain management.

### Effect of gender and obesity on electrical current thresholds [^111AsHCH]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this study we investigated the influence of gender and obesity on electrical current thresholds in an attempt to optimize the application of skeletal muscle electrical stimulation (ES) in clinical practice.

Methods

Thirty-two obese and 35 age-matched, non-obese men and women received graded ES to the quadriceps muscle for sensory (detection) and motor (contraction) threshold assessment. Concomitant pain and tolerance to ES were recorded.

Results

Sensory threshold was lower in women than in men (P < 0.001), both obese and non-obese. Sensory and motor thresholds were higher in obese than in non-obese subjects (P < 0.05), and body mass index was a strong predictor of motor excitability (r² = 0.56–0.61). Current tolerance to motor stimulation was reduced in obese individuals, particularly in women, whereas pain was not influenced by gender or obesity.

Conclusions

We suggest that both gender and obesity factors should be carefully considered in the design of rational ES treatments.

### Sex differences in pain expressed by patients across diverse disease states: individual patient data meta-analysis of 33, 957 participants in 10 randomized controlled trials [^111so2at]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The experience of pain is determined by many factors and has a significant impact on quality of life. This study aimed to determine sex differences in pain prevalence and intensity reported by participants with diverse disease states in several large international clinical trials. Individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted using EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire pain data from randomised controlled trials published between January 2000 and January 2020 and undertaken by investigators at the George Institute for Global Health. Proportional odds logistic regression models, comparing pain scores between females and males and fitted with adjustments for age and randomized treatment, were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. In 10 trials involving 33,957 participants (38% females) with EQ-5D pain score data, the mean age ranged between 50 and 74. Pain was reported more frequently by females than males (47% vs 37%; P < 0.001). Females also reported greater levels of pain than males (adjusted odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.24–1.61; P < 0.001). In stratified analyses, there were differences in pain by disease group (P for heterogeneity < 0.001), but not by age group or region of recruitment. Females were more likely to report pain, and at a higher level, compared with males across diverse diseases, all ages, and geographical regions. This study reinforces the importance of reporting sex-disaggregated analysis to identify similarities and differences between females and males that reflect variable biology and may affect disease profiles and have implications for management.

### The impact of sleep disturbance on pain perception: a systematic review examining the moderating effect of sex and age [^114w7TLE]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Females have increased pain sensitivity and are more vulnerable to chronic pain conditions. Sleep disturbances are comorbid with chronic pain and exacerbate pain symptoms. Different types of sleep disturbance affect pain perception distinctly, but it is not clear if these effects are equal in men and women. This systematic review investigated potential differences in how sleep disturbance affects pain in males and females. We searched EBSCO, MEDLINE, Psych INFO, Science Direct, and Web of Science from January 2001 to November 2022 and found 38 studies with 978 participants. Separate random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect sizes based on standardized mean differences (SMDs) of experimental sleep disturbance paradigms on various pain outcomes. Sex moderated the effect of sleep disturbance on pain facilitation (SMD = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.004 to 0.022; p = .009) and pain inhibition (SMD = 0.033; 95%CI: 0.011 to 0.054; p = .005), with increased facilitation and decreased inhibition in females, but the opposite effect in males. Further, age moderated the effects of total sleep deprivation (SMD = -0.194; 95%CI -0.328 to -0.060; p = .008) on pain sensitivity and fragmented sleep (SMD = -0.110; 95%CI: 0.148 to -0.072; p < .001) on pain threshold. While the moderating effect of sex and age on the sleep-pain relationship was small, these factors need to be considered in future sleep-pain research.

### Vertebral fractures and self-perceived health in elderly women and men in a population-based cross-sectional study: the troms ø study 2007–08 [^1115MTHa]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based study, we found a prevalence of vertebral fracture which was quite similar in men and women above the age of 50 years, but women with prevalent vertebral fractures reported more often back pain and had poorer EQ-5D-3 L and EQ VAS scores than women without vertebral fractures. In men, no such associations were observed. Type of fracture (wedge, biconcave, or compression) did not influence the results, but number of fractures (1, 2, 3 or more) and severity of fractures (mild, moderate, or severe) influenced the scores in women.

One explanation of the gender difference in results could be that men tolerate a higher degree of physical pain than women do. Pain assessment has always been a challenge and remains so. As pain is both a personal and a subjective matter, researchers have to rely on people's self-reported experience without any further verification. The nature of pain makes objective measurement impossible. It has for a long time been acknowledged that there are gender differences in pain experiences, especially in conditions like chronic back pain. In a review from 2009, Fillingim et al. state that women are at substantially greater risk of many clinical pain conditions, including general musculoskeletal pain, back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Although we have not been able to find other studies comparing differences in pain sensations among persons with and without vertebral fractures, the findings reported by Fillingim et al. may apply to vertebral fractures as well. Another possible explanation of our findings could of course be that men have more asymptomatic vertebral fractures from earlier ages, as noted by others. Any fracture that occurs in younger years will heal faster and with fewer problems than fractures due to osteoporosis in later stages of life. Because of the study design, this is only a hypothesis, and we will need both follow-up data and studies on younger populations to draw conclusions on this matter.

### Gender, genetics, and analgesia: understanding the differences in response to pain relief [^115d2fo4]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Sex hormones and neural correlates

Sex hormones have been known to play a significant role in gender difference in pain perception and analgesia. Testosterone has been found to decrease pain sensitivity, and a low testosterone state has been demonstrated in many chronic pain conditions, but the effects of estrogen and progesterone on pain are more complicated, with both pro- and antinoci-ceptive properties. Use of exogenous sex hormones has also been related to an increased risk of chronic pain conditions. Considering the role of sex hormones in nociception, intragroup variation in pain perception in females and variations in the same individual at various stages of sexual development and cyclical variation with the menstrual cycle hold clinical significance, though the literature evidence is inconsistent.–For instance, many studies suggested that females in postovulatory luteal phase show increased pain sensitivity compared to follicular phase. Pain symptoms in chronic pain conditions seem to be most severe around menstruation, associated with the falling levels of estrogen. Other studies have shown an association between high levels of female reproductive hormones and pain conditions. To add to this controversy, there is a growing body of recent literature, suggesting a lack of variability in pain response across the menstrual cycle. More studies are required to gain further insight.

Age of the individual plays an important role in pain sensitivity and analgesic response due to variation in sex hormone levels and differences in body composition and metabolic ability. Many chronic pain conditions show no difference in prevalence, between genders, and before puberty. Females show an increased prevalence of these conditions around puberty. Gender difference in cortical pain processing has also been demonstrated. Neuroimaging has demonstrated reduced pain-related activation of CNS antinociceptive pathways in females with low testosterone levels. Animal studies also show a sexual dimorphism in the anatomy and function of the CNS pain modulatory system. Midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter and its descending projections to the rostral ventro-medial medulla (RVM) and spinal cord form an important descending antinociceptive pathway.–Pain stimulates PAG, resulting in a release of endogenous opioids. Studies in rats showed no qualitative sex difference in the PAG– RVM system, but quantitatively, female rats had a greater number of neurons compared to the males. On the contrary, functional studies have shown significantly lower activation of PAG–RVM neurons in response to persistent inflammatory pain in female rats compared to male rats. Despite this difference, both male and female rats exhibited similar hyperalgesia after chemically induced inflammatory pain. This suggests the existence of alternative, sex-specific pain-modulating pathways.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^1169RCSc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample Size Calculation

Over the entire age interval from 20 to 80 years, the 95% confidence bands of both gender-specific medians of finger algometry had to be maximally ± 0.5 points wide, where one point is the smallest difference measurable between two individuals. An interim analysis estimated the Kernel density and hence the heteroscedastic variance functions. Based on assumed consistency of the latter function, the formula for asymptotic conservative confidence bands indicated how much the sample size still had to increase in order to decrease the 95% confidence bands to the target width. In case of gender-dependent variance functions, the larger of both functions was the reference for both genders. After prudent rounding, the sample size resulting from this calculation was 40 women and 40 men in each of the eight age decades (18–20 years, third to eighth decade, and > 80 years), summing up to a total of 640 participants.

### Needs and wishes towards sex-and gender-sensitive chronic pain management: a qualitative study with German general practitioners [^1144jkhj]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is a common condition worldwide that is often treated with opioids. However, there is evidence that only a small proportion of patients benefits from long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) in terms of pain relief. Inadequate treatment can contribute to an increased risk of opioid abuse and pain chronification, as well as potential resignation among patients and physicians. Current research suggests that gender is a crucial factor influencing the complex pathogenesis, disease progression, and treatment experience. This applies to biological, psychological, and social aspects. Studies indicate that, on a biological level, hormonal factors, immune system functioning, and neurochemical mechanisms contribute to gender differences in pain processing and perception. This relationship also affects how medications, particularly opioids, exert their effects. Moreover, gender influences the prevalence of chronic pain and its comorbidities, interacting dynamically with psychosocial factors. Internalized gender roles impact pain tolerance, also men and women employ different coping strategies. Furthermore, gender plays a crucial role in shaping the doctor-patient relationship. Research has shown that communication in medical consultations is influenced by the gender of both the physician and the patient. Additionally, treatment preferences vary: women tend to benefit more from multimodal treatment approaches or group therapy. However, it remains unclear how these aspects manifest in the daily practice of general practitioners and what specific needs and preferences they have regarding gender-sensitive pain management.

### Defining gender disparities in pain management [^113dwUHH]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prevalence rates of most musculoskeletal pain conditions are higher among women than men. Reasons for these prevalence disparities likely include sex differences in basic pain mechanisms and gender differences in psychosocial factors.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this review were to (1) identify reasons for differences in pain prevalence between men and women, (2) assess whether musculoskeletal pain conditions are differently treated in men and women, and (3) identify reasons for sex/gender disparities in pain treatment.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was conducted using the terms "pain" or "musculoskeletal pain" and "gender differences" or "sex differences" with "health care", "health services", and "physician, attitude". Articles judged relevant were selected for inclusion. WHERE ARE WE NOW? Higher pain prevalence in women is consistently observed but not well understood. The relative contributions of sex differences in pain mechanisms and gender differences in psychosocial factors (eg, coping, social roles) to explaining differences in prevalence are not yet clear. Gender disparities in the amount of healthcare use for pain may be partially explained by the experience of higher-intensity pain in women. Pain intensity also seems to be a major factor influencing treatment, especially the prescription of medications for acute pain. However, clinicians' gender stereotypes, as well as the clinician's own gender, appear to influence diagnostic and treatment decisions for more persistent pain problems. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO? The ultimate goal is optimal pain control for each individual, with gender being one difference between individuals. HOW DO WE GET THERE? Further research is needed to address all three major purposes, with particular attention to whether gender-specific pain treatment may sometimes be warranted.

### Gender role expectations of pain is associated with pain tolerance limit but not with pain threshold [^111rhqt1]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Gender role expectations of pain (GREP) was suggested to predict sex differences in pain perception. Our aim was to explore sex differences in GREP and investigate its relationship with heat-pain threshold (HPT) and heat-pain tolerance limit (HPTL). University students (115 males, 134 females) filled the GREP questionnaire. HPT and HPTL were measured in a sample of 72 students. Additionally, GREP values of the present sample were compared with those of the original, American sample to explore possible cultural effects. Both males and females perceive themselves (and their own sex in general) to be less sensitive to pain and less willing to report of pain than the opposite sex. Males perceived themselves and other men, to endure pain relatively similar to women whereas females perceived themselves and other women as less endurable to pain than men. HPT was similar for the two sexes but males had higher HPTL than females. Within each sex, HPTL correlated mainly with self's perception of pain sensitivity. The American and Israeli samples differed in that Israeli males and females presented stronger stereotypical views towards same and opposite sexes. Both males and females held stereotypical "macho" attitude towards themselves with regard to pain sensitivity and willingness to report of pain however only females held stereotypical, "macho" attitude towards themselves with regard to pain endurance. The sex differences in GREP and in HPTL and the correlations between GREP items and experimental thresholds suggest that the relationship between GREP and experimental pain is complex and sex-specific. It also appears that GREP is affected by culture.

### Sex differences in experimental measures of pain sensitivity and endogenous pain inhibition [^113hbH8Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of the present investigation provide evidence for sex differences in pain sensitivity as well as endogenous pain inhibition. Specifically, women demonstrated less tolerance for the IPT and less efficient CPM compared to men. A unique finding from this study is that sex differences in both IPT tolerance and CPM effects continued even after considering the influences of depressive symptoms and sleep quality. The sex difference in IPT tolerance revealed in this study generally parallels results from a prior investigation that examined unidimensional aspects of pain sensitivity such as threshold and tolerance. Our finding of a sex difference in CPM effects is also consistent with several past studies that have shown less-efficient pain inhibitory capacity for women compared with men.–Interestingly, of the limited number of studies published to date, the majority seemingly argue against sex differences in endogenous pain inhibitory processes. The mixed nature of these findings may be attributed in part to differences in experimental methodology as well as the intensity of the conditioning stimulus used to assess inhibitory effects. For example, previous studies examining sex differences in CPM tended to more consistently reveal greater CPM for men than for women when CPM was assessed via pain thresholds. This is consistent with our findings and the methodology used in this study for the assessment of CPM.

Much attention has been directed towards explaining the biological underpinnings of sex differences in pain sensitivity. For example, it has been suggested that sex chromosomes and steroidal actions on development lead to differences in pain physiology between men and women. Work in both animal, and human, models also suggests that sex-specific hormones (eg, estrogen) influence sex-specific responses to pain. However, the exact mechanism of these effects in development and/or adulthood is debated. Further investigations have identified neurobiological differences between men and women in brain regions related to pain sensitivity, such as the periaqueductal grayand the strength of its connectivity with the amygdala caudate and the putamen. Despite efforts to characterize this phenomenon from a biological perspective, nothing to date has fully accounted for sex differences in pain sensitivity. Thus, further research into the underlying physiology of sex-specific pain sensitivity is necessary, particularly in human models.

### Sex differences in facial expressions of pain: results from a combined sample [^1166pS49]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

3. Results

3.1. Sex differences in pain threshold and subjective responses to pain (pain intensity ratings)

A significant main effect of sex on pain threshold was shown (t(385) = −5.64; P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.57). As can be seen in Figure 2 A, pain thresholds were lower for females compared with males. When analyzing how stable the sex difference in pain thresholds was across studies, the indicator of heterogeneity I² showed low-to-moderate heterogeneity between studies (I² = 30.7%). Thus, the significant lower pain threshold in women was a relatively stable finding across studies. Given that the painful heat intensities applied for assessing subjective and facial responses were tailored to the pain threshold, this means that women (48.39°C; SD = 1.39) received significantly lower heat intensities compared with men (49.18°C; SD = 1.43) (t(384) = −5.69; P < 0.001).

Figure 2.
(A) Mean pain threshold (in degrees °C) for female and male participants, error bars: SD. (B) Mean pain intensity ratings for female and male participants, error bars: SD; ✱✱✱ p < 0.001, n. s.: P > 0.05.

Males and females did not differ in their subjective responses to pain as shown by a nonsignificant main effect of sex (t(385) = −0.02; P = 0.998; Cohen d < 0.01) (Fig. 2 B). Thus, adjusting the phasic heat stimulation to the individual pain threshold was successful in eliciting comparable subjective responses to pain (pain intensity ratings) in male and female participants. The lack of sex difference in pain intensity ratings was very stable across studies, as shown by the indicator of heterogeneity (I² = 0%; please note that I² is set to 0 for negative values, so that I² ranges from 0% to 100%).

### Studying sex and gender differences in pain and analgesia: a consensus report [^117SMfrd]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

In September 2006, members of the Sex, Gender and Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain met to discuss the following: (1) what is known about sex and gender differences in pain and analgesia; (2) what are the "best practice" guidelines for pain research with respect to sex and gender; and (3) what are the crucial questions to address in the near future? The resulting consensus presented herein includes input from basic science, clinical and psychosocial pain researchers, as well as from recognized experts in sexual differentiation and reproductive endocrinology. We intend this document to serve as a utilitarian and thought-provoking guide for future research on sex and gender differences in pain and analgesia, both for those currently working in this field as well as those still wondering, "Do I really need to study females?"

### Sex differences in pain: a brief review of clinical and experimental findings [^117Rxxn2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Recent years have witnessed substantially increased research regarding sex differences in pain. The expansive body of literature in this area clearly suggests that men and women differ in their responses to pain, with increased pain sensitivity and risk for clinical pain commonly being observed among women. Also, differences in responsivity to pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions have been observed; however, these effects are not always consistent and appear dependent on treatment type and characteristics of both the pain and the provider. Although the specific aetiological basis underlying these sex differences is unknown, it seems inevitable that multiple biological and psychosocial processes are contributing factors. For instance, emerging evidence suggests that genotype and endogenous opioid functioning play a causal role in these disparities, and considerable literature implicates sex hormones as factors influencing pain sensitivity. However, the specific modulatory effect of sex hormones on pain among men and women requires further exploration. Psychosocial processes such as pain coping and early-life exposure to stress may also explain sex differences in pain, in addition to stereotypical gender roles that may contribute to differences in pain expression. Therefore, this review will provide a brief overview of the extant literature examining sex-related differences in clinical and experimental pain, and highlights several biopsychosocial mechanisms implicated in these male-female differences. The future directions of this field of research are discussed with an emphasis aimed towards further elucidation of mechanisms which may inform future efforts to develop sex-specific treatments.

### Sex differences in fear of pain: item-level analysis of the fear of pain questionnaire III [^114a7Ayk]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fear of pain (FOP) and anxiety are often measured as covariates in experimental and clinical pain studies. Fear and anxiety are typically defined as related but distinct constructs, with fear representing an alarm reaction toward a presented threat, and anxiety a future-focused fear or worry. Previous studies have revealed that females are more sensitive to painand have lower pain threshold and tolerance than their male peers. A recent meta-analysis reviewing sex differences in experimental pain research concluded that hormones and depression are not the contributing factors to sex differences in pain, but that anxiety, cognitive, and social factors are.FOP has been associated with increased sensitivity to pain and reduced pain threshold. There is an evidence for the existence of sex differences here as well, with findings suggesting that high levels of FOP reduce pain tolerance in females, but not in males. Other studies have reported that anxiety may increase painand that anxiety is more strongly associated with pain in males than in females.

### Androgen receptors expressed in the primary sensory neurons regulate mechanical pain sensitivity [^117RhGEM]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain is a critical alert system embedded in both humans and animals, essential for recognizing potential tissue damage or injury and triggering protective responses. Although it was traditionally assumed that pain mechanisms were similar across sexes, accumulating evidence indicates significant sex-based differences in pain perception and tolerance in both preclinical research and clinical practice. Females typically exhibit lower pain thresholds and tolerance in experimental settings, reflecting greater sensitivity to painful stimuli. These sex differences are also observed in chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia and migraines, which are more prevalent and severe in females compared to males. Despite multiple studies on pain perception, it remains unclear which types of painful stimuli consistently show sex differences under physiological conditions. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying these differences are still under investigation, likely involving complex interactions among sex hormones, sex-specific genes, and neural networks and activities. Of particular interest are the roles of sex hormones (eg, androgens and estrogens) in pain perception, a topic gaining increased attention in pain research.

Several lines of evidence suggest that androgens and estrogens modulate pain perception. Because of the widespread expression of their receptors and biosynthesis process in which androgens are converted to estrogens, understanding their hormonal effects is complex. We previously reported that pexidartinib exhibited dimorphic therapeutic effects on chronic pain between normal male and gonadectomized (GDX) male mice, suggesting androgens play a key role in sex differences in pain. However, the molecular mechanisms by which androgens regulate the pain sensitivity remain unclear.

The androgen receptor (AR) is widely expressed in regions involved in pain transmission and processing, including the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Because physiological pain often originates from the activation of primary sensory neurons and is transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS), it is crucial to explore the androgen targets within the pain transmission pathway. As primary sensory neurons detect the type and intensity of pain, we hypothesized that androgens regulate sensory neuron characteristics and contribute to sex differences in pain perception.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between androgen levels and pain responses to various painful stimuli using GDX male mice, which lack circulating androgens, and female mice treated with androgens. To determine whether androgens directly affect primary sensory neurons, we generated sensory neuron–selective AR conditional knockout (AR-cKO) male and female mice. This approach allows us to isolate the effects of androgens on sensory neurons from those on CNS neurons. Importantly, AR-cKO mice serve as a precise tool for evaluating the role of androgens in pain regulation while excluding the potential effects of estrogens converted from androgens.

### Sex-specific genetics underlie increased chronic pain risk in women: genome-wide association studies from the UK biobank [^112h96dv]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The overrepresentation of women among chronic pain patients is well documented, with women reporting more pain, displaying lower tolerance for it, and being more affected by COPC. The causes for these observations are multi-factorial. For instance, genetic, and psychosocial factors, and gender norms and role expectationshave been proposed to explain sex differences with regards to pain. Nonetheless, the National Institutes of Health recently adopted a 'Sex as a Biological Variable' policy, emphasising that sex differences might be masked by the usage of males only in preclinical research. Indeed, the analysis of sex differences in the context of pain research started providing insights into sex-specific molecular pathways of pain.

Evidence showing reliable sex differences in the CNS contributing to a higher prevalence of chronic pain conditions in women is, however, lacking. As pain is perceived in the brain, noninvasive brain imaging techniques are ideal for probing the structure and function of the brain in vivo, enabling the study of the relationships between multimodal brain images and pain. Both pain phenotypes, and structural and functional brain characteristics, are highly heritable, as evidenced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Furthermore, chronic but not acute back pain has been found to have significant heritability in patients with low back pain, with results likely transposable to chronic pain at other body sites. The search for genetic underpinnings in chronic pain-relevant tissues often pointed to the CNS rather than the peripheral nervous system. The scarcity of evidence from previous genetic studies on the subject of sex differences in pain yielded only a few biological insights, despite the well-documented differences in presentation and aetiology of pain traits in men and women (or males vs females animal models). Thus, the subject deserves more attention.

In this work, we tackled the basic questions as to why and how women experience more chronic pain than men. To address these questions, we used genetics, self-reported chronic pain, and brain imaging data from the large cohort of the UK Biobank.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113d2tgD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — hydromorphone: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 2 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and an initial dose of 4 to 8 mg may be given for severe pain. There is no optimal or maximum dose of hydromorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 4, and t½ (hr): 2 to 3. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated use with caution and start at 25% to 50% of usual dose at the low end of the dosing range, and for hepatic or renal dysfunction reduce initial dose by 25% to 50% of usual dose depending on degree of impairment. Other considerations note women appear to have a 25% higher Cmax than men, and hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to active metabolites (mainly hydro-morphone 3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal impairment.

### Exploring the difference between men and women in physical functioning: how do sociodemographic, lifestyle-and health-related determinants contribute? [^116NKfn4]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To explore whether differences between men and women in the sensitivity to (strength of the association) and/or in the exposure to determinants (prevalence) contribute to the difference in physical functioning, with women reporting more limitations.

Methods

Data of the Doetinchem Cohort Study was used (n = 5856, initial ages 26–70 years), with follow-up measurements every 5 years (up to 20). Physical functioning (subscale SF-36, range:0–100), sex (men or women) and a number of socio-demographic, lifestyle- and health-related determinants were assessed. Mixed-model multivariable analysis was used to investigate differences between men and women in sensitivity (interaction term with sex) and in exposure (change of the sex difference when adjusting) to determinants of physical functioning.

Results

The physical functioning score among women was 6.55 (95%CI:5.48,7.61) points lower than among men. In general, men and women had similar determinants, but pain was more strongly associated with physical functioning (higher sensitivity), and also more prevalent among women (higher exposure). The higher exposure to low educational level and not having a paid job also contributed to the lower physical functioning score among women. In contrast, current smoking, mental health problems and a low educational level were more strongly associated with a lower physical functioning score among men and lower physical activity and higher BMI were more prevalent among men.

Conclusions

Although important for physical functioning among both men and women, our findings provide no indications for reducing the difference in physical functioning by promoting a healthy lifestyle but stress the importance of differences in pain, work and education.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^116hRkz5]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

On the middle finger, the difference between the medians of women and men was less than one unit. There was no exception over the entire age interval from 20 to 80 years. In other words, women might be more pressure-sensitive than men, but then the difference is subliminal. The widths of the 95% confidence bands yield sufficient statistical power, and yet their overlapping shows that the difference is below statistical significance (Figure 5).

Figure 5
Pressure sensitivity on the finger in 347 women compared to 301 men. Provided that our sample is representative, the medians split the individuals of the respective gender in two equally large groups. The middle lines are our estimates, and the 95% confidence bands indicate their statistical precision. Due to the smaller number of individuals, the gender-specific confidence bands are wider than the overall confidence bands. However, they remain narrower than one unit. Thus, the gender-specific statistical power is sufficient, too. The difference between men and women fluctuates between zero and 0.6 units. This difference is below the individual perception of one unit and clearly below the minimal clinically important difference of two units. It is below statistical significance, too, as the 95% confidence bands overlap. The median increase in pressure sensitivity in men starts to increase with the age of 40 years and reaches its maximum difference of half a measurement unit at the age of 70 years. In women pressure sensitivity increases from 20 years to 32 years reaching a first peak followed by a slight dip and a second peek with 76 years with a maximum difference of 1.2 measurement units.

### Modelling pain perception using fuzzy cognitive maps [^116xMJwB]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychologically, pain experience is shaped by cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors. Protective psychological traits such as optimism and self-efficacy mitigate pain, while vulnerability factors, including fear, anxiety, and pain catastrophizing, enhance pain perception and chronicity. Negative emotions, notably anxiety and anger, significantly contribute to increased pain sensitivity by activating hormonal and neurotransmitter pathways. Sociocultural context further modulates pain perception. Cultural norms influence the expression and interpretation of pain, with some societies encouraging open emotional displays and others promoting restraint. Strong social support generally correlates with lower pain perception, whereas isolation and lack of support are associated with heightened sensitivity.

Individual differences in pain perception are rooted in both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variations, evidenced by twin studies, contribute significantly to individual variability in pain sensitivity. Moreover, gender differences exist in pain processing mechanisms, partly due to sex-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs), hormones, and neurobiological differences. Aging is another critical determinant, affecting pain thresholds and tolerance levels due to progressive sensory system changes. Personality traits, notably neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, significantly impact how pain is experienced and managed. Higher neuroticism levels correlate with increased pain sensitivity and reduced tolerance, while secure attachment styles and positive personality traits are generally protective against intense pain perception. Pain classifications (acute vs chronic and nociceptive vs neuropathic) differ primarily by their underlying tissue or nerve damage mechanisms, influencing treatment approaches and prognosis.

### Gender, genetics, and analgesia: understanding the differences in response to pain relief [^116sqLHr]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Psychological factors

Behavioral modifications, pain coping strategies, represent the first response in handling pain. Females are known to use a variety of coping mechanisms such as seeking social support, emotion-focused techniques, attention focus, cognitive re-interpretation, and positive self-statement. Men more frequently engage in problem-focused techniques and behavioral distraction to handle pain.

Women are known to catastrophize more than men, and this involves magnification and self-rumination of pain-related information. Catastrophizing is associated with chronic and persistent pain. Men show higher degrees of self-efficacy, which refers to the belief that one can successfully perform a behavior to achieve a goal.

Incidences of depression and anxiety differ among males and females, and these psychological factors increase the risk for pain perception and transition from acute pain to chronic pain.

Gender and analgesic response

The gender differences in drug response can either be pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic differences. Body composition and metabolism differ between genders. Sex hormones also influence protein binding and metabolism of various drugs, introducing a pharmacokinetic dimorphism. Examples of pharmacodynamic differences include MOR dimorphism and sex hormonal influences on MOR second messenger activation. The existence of alternate, sex-specific, pain modulating pathways also influences analgesic response.

It is observed that women are more likely to be prescribed analgesic medications especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Women also use more over the counter analgesics compared to men. This may reflect a higher prevalence of many inflammatory and chronic pain conditions among women compared to men. Among NSAIDs, men have demonstrated better pain control with ibuprofen, while women reported better analgesia with ketorolac, but the abovementioned studies measured response to experimental pain. In an animal study, cyclo-oxygenase (COX) knockout female mice exhibited reduced joint destruction compared to COX knockout male mice. Thus, a gender difference in analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs is possible.

### Pain-related anxiety influences pain perception differently in men and women: a quantitative sensory test across thermal pain modalities [^111LxLBZ]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

The sexes differ with respect to perception of experimental pain. Anxiety influences pain perception more in men than in women; however, there lacks research exploring which anxiety constructs influence pain perception differentially between men and women. Furthermore, research examining whether depression is associated with pain perception differently between the sexes remains scant. The present investigation was designed to examine how trait anxiety, pain-related anxiety constructs (ie, fear of pain, pain-related anxiety, anxiety sensitivity), and depression are associated with pain perception between the sexes. A total of 95 nonclinical participants (55% women) completed measures assessing the constructs of interest and participated in quantitative sensory testing using heat and cold stimuli administered by a Medoc Pathway Pain and Sensory Evaluation System. The findings suggest that pain-related anxiety constructs, but not trait anxiety, are associated with pain perception. Furthermore, these constructs are associated with pain intensity ratings in men and pain tolerance levels in women. This contrasts with previous research suggesting that anxiety influences pain perception mostly or uniquely in men. Depression was not systematically associated with pain perception in either sex. Systematic relationships were not identified that allow conclusions regarding how fear of pain, pain-related anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity may contribute to pain perception differentially in men and women; however, anxiety sensitivity was associated with increased pain tolerance, a novel finding needing further examination. The results provide directions for future research and clinical endeavors and support that fear and anxiety are important features associated with hyperalgesia in both men and women.

### A systematic literature review of 10 years of research on sex / gender and pain perception-part 2: do biopsychosocial factors alter pain sensitivity differently in women and men? [^116MG6Ew]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review summarizes the results of 10 years of laboratory research on pain and sex/gender. An electronic search strategy was designed by a medical librarian to access multiple databases. A total of 172 articles published between 1998 and 2008 were retrieved, analyzed, and synthesized. The second set of results presented in this review (129 articles) examined various biopsychosocial factors that may contribute to differences in pain sensitivity between healthy women and men. The results revealed that the involvement of hormonal and physiological factors is either inconsistent or absent. Some studies suggest that temporal summation, allodynia, and secondary hyperalgesia may be more pronounced in women than in men. The evidence to support less efficient endogenous pain inhibitory systems in women is mixed and does not necessarily apply to all pain modalities. With regard to psychological factors, depression may not mediate sex differences in pain perception, while the role of anxiety is ambiguous. Cognitive and social factors appear to partly explain some sex-related differences. Finally, past individual history may be influential in female pain responses. However, these conclusions must be treated with much circumspection for various methodological reasons. Furthermore, some factors/mechanisms remain understudied in the field. There is also a need to assess and improve the ecological validity of findings from laboratory studies on healthy subjects, and perhaps a change of paradigm needs to be considered at this point in time to better understand the factors that influence the experience of women and men who suffer from acute or chronic pain.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^1148A8Ln]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The distance between the two quartiles on the finger fluctuated between 1.5 and 2.4 measurement units of the analogue pain rating scale. On the ear lobe, the distance between the quartiles fluctuated between 2.5 and 3.4 units, which is almost two times larger than the maximal difference between men and women and the maximal age-dependent increase. The widely spaced quartiles indicate another important fact that other factors, such as central sensitivity, are more relevant for pressure sensitivity than gender or age.

In summary, the slightly, higher pressure sensitivity of women compared to men and the age-dependent increase are negligible; the differences are often not even one unit. Compared to a former study using the identical test protocol chronic pain without generalized hyperalgesia affects pressure sensitivity by several units, and the impact of chronic pain with generalized hyperalgesia is even higher. On the middle fingers and on ear lobes more than 90% of the 80 years old pain-free persons – women or men – still rate their sensitivity below the average of persons with generalized hyperalgesia (see the 90th centile). In other words, the difference between presence versus absence of central hyperalgesia is too large to be masked by gender or age fluctuations. This eases the diagnosis of central hyperalgesia and the task of all clinicians who monitor the progress of their therapy.

### Sex differences in perceived pain are affected by an anxious brain [^1179N89Y]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Decades of research confirm that women have greater pain sensitivity than men. Women also show greater overall anxiety sensitivity than men. Given these differences, we hypothesized that sex differences in anxiety would explain sex differences in experienced pain and physiological responses to pain (at both spinal and cortical levels). By measuring subjective pain, state/trait anxiety, nociceptive flexion reflexes, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), it was possible to test the effects of anxiety on the processing of painful drives at different levels of the neuraxis while also documenting the role played by anxiety on sex differences in experienced pain. Results confirm that women are indeed more sensitive to pain than men. Importantly, this difference was accompanied by a significant sex difference in cortical activity (SEP amplitude) but not spinal nociceptive activity, suggesting that much of the sex difference in experienced pain is attributable to variations in thalamocortical processing and to ensuing changes in the appraisal of and/or emotional response to noxious insult. In support of this claim, we found that sex differences in cortical activity and subjective pain disappeared when trait anxiety was controlled for. This means that stable predispositions to respond with heightened apprehension contribute to baseline pain sensitivity differences between the sexes. These results indicate that the modulatory effect of affect on pain-related brain processes may explain why men and women experience painful shocks so differently. In our study, the mediating role of anxiety on sex differences in pain was tested and confirmed using path analysis.

### Age-related and sex-related changes in perfusion index in response to noxious electrical stimulation in healthy subjects [^115PuGV6]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We observed that PI decreased with noxious electrical stimulation even though the magnitude of stimulation was too small to induce changes in pulse rate. Moreover, the magnitude of response to electrical stimulation was different between the groups. PI did not change with stimulation in aged women. Even though PI is a good objective indicator, its usefulness as a complementary pain evaluation tool should be monitored carefully when evaluating aged women.

Individual differences do exist in terms of sensitivity to pain. Various population-based studies suggest that women are more likely to experience chronic pain syndrome and tend to report more severe pain than men.–In our study, pain tolerance was significantly higher in young men than in young women. However, in the elderly, there was no difference between males and females. Previous reviews related to sex differences concluded that women had significantly greater pain sensitivity than men, but they also acknowledged that these differences were not always consistent. Age-related differences may also be an important contributing factor. In our study, the pain detection threshold was significantly higher in young men than in aged men, even though pain tolerance was not significantly different between these groups. Higher tolerance implies a longer duration of stimulation. Thus, some of the effects observed in male subjects could have probably resulted from the extended duration of stimulation.

### Musculoskeletal pain among Chinese women during the menopausal transition: findings from a longitudinal cohort study [^1115miMj]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

Studies have shown a significant difference in pain prevalence between males and females, that women are more likely than men to experience common chronic pain, and these symptoms even worsen in middle-aged women. Gonadal steroid hormones are believed to play a role in sex differences in pain sensitivity and tolerance. Several studies have shown that women reported more pain and multiple forms of postoperative pain after surgery, although they have fewer proinflammatory biomarkers than men. The etiology of musculoskeletal pain in middle-aged women remains poorly understood. Several studies have revealed that more than half of middle-aged women suffer from chronic muscle and joint pain. Despite the high prevalence of menopausal symptoms among middle-aged women, only a small percentage of women seek treatment for their pain symptoms.

This is a prospective study investigating the trajectories of musculoskeletal pain in Chinese women during midlife. The primary objective of our study was to examine the prevalence of 4 types of musculoskeletal pain and the associated factors during the menopausal transition. And our analysis revealed an even higher prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in Chinese middle-aged women, with the prevalence exceeding 60% in postmenopausal women. The incidence of all types of pain increased with the progression of menopause, except for neck pain, which demonstrated a slight decline from women during menopausal transition to postmenopause. In addition, we further evaluated the severity of each type of musculoskeletal pain, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. We demonstrated that the severity of musculoskeletal pain also worsened as the menopausal stage progressed. The majority of participants suffered from multiple types of musculoskeletal pain. Moreover, we identified general health status as an influencing factor for the occurrence of these symptoms, which suggests that improving perimenopausal health care might be important for preventing or treating these symptoms.

### Qualitative sex differences in pain processing: emerging evidence of a biased literature [^1114TxpM]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2020). High credibility.

Although most patients with chronic pain are women, the preclinical literature regarding pain processing and the pathophysiology of chronic pain has historically been derived overwhelmingly from the study of male rodents. This Review describes how the recent adoption by a number of funding agencies of policies mandating the incorporation of sex as a biological variable into preclinical research has correlated with an increase in the number of studies investigating sex differences in pain and analgesia. Trends in the field are analysed, with a focus on newly published findings of qualitative sex differences: that is, those findings that are suggestive of differential processing mechanisms in each sex. It is becoming increasingly clear that robust differences exist in the genetic, molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms of acute and chronic pain processing in male and female rodents and humans.

### Sexual dimorphism in functional pain syndromes [^115uxTmP]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury-free pain conditions, defined as functional pain syndromes, are more prevalent and more disabling in women. Mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in functional pain are now emerging from preclinical studies, suggesting an opportunity to advance the development of sex-specific therapies that may improve treatment of pain in women.

### Sex differences in experimental measures of pain sensitivity and endogenous pain inhibition [^113ufkkQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronically painful conditions are generally more prevalent in women than in men, from puberty to menopause and beyond. Common chronic pain conditions that are more prevalent in women than in men include migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder, and pain associated with rheumatic diseases. Sex differences in the severity of the chronic pain conditions are also well documented. Women generally report more severe pain, more frequent bouts of pain, more anatomically diffuse pain, and longer-lasting pain than men with similar disease processes. Further, these sex differences persist even after male-specific and female-specific disorders (eg, male urologic and female gynecologic) are excluded from analyses.

Increased pain sensitivity and disruption of endogenous pain inhibitory processes have been hypothesized as potential mechanisms that may account, at least in part, for the greater prevalence and severity of chronic pain in women compared with men. Using quantitative sensory testing (QST) in laboratory settings, researchers have tested sex differences in response to experimental pain stimuli using unidimensional measures of pain sensitivity (eg, pain threshold and tolerance) as well as dynamic protocols of pain inhibition, such as conditioned pain modulation (CPM) tasks. The research addressing sex differences in unidimensional pain sensitivity measures has generally produced consistent results, such that women demonstrate lower thresholds and tolerances compared with men for pressure pain, electrical pain, ischemic pain, heat pain, and cold pain. Interestingly, studies investigating sex differences in dynamic tests of pain inhibitory processes such as CPM have produced inconsistent findings. Some studies have reported less-efficient pain inhibitory capacity for women compared to men,–whereas other studies did not report any such sex differences.–Given the mixed nature of the literature regarding sex differences in pain inhibition, additional research addressing this topic seems warranted.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^115GE5tL]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

There are relatively few investigations on age-related changes in pain sensitivity response. Their findings suggest that pain perception decreases in old age, although they were generally equivocal. Previous studies comparing the pressure pain threshold in kilopascal of healthy participants found that elderly people were between equally and two times more sensitive to pressure than younger people.-The test locations and age limits for distinguishing between "young" and "old" were inconsistent between the studies. This could also apply to our measurement method. However, our examination has the advantage that it does not represent absolute values, but rather calibrated in relation to the maximum imaginable pain at the respective location.

In an extensive PubMed search with the criteria "Pain", "Age" "QST" and "PPT", 21 of more than 100 screened articles were read and tabulated. None of these looked at age-dependent pressure sensitivity as something floatable rather than comparing two groups. For this reason, we believe that we were the first. On the finger, the median sensitivity had a minimum of one point from 20 to 45 years and a maximum of two points at 75 years. On the ear lobe, it had a minimum of five points at 30 years and a maximum of six points from 60 to 80 years. Again, the ratio strongly depends on the location, whereas the difference is always one point. The ratio is in line with previous findings that show higher pain sensitivity in higher age as it is between 1.2 and two measurement units, which is below MCID. However, a meta-analysis and other studies found the opposite, namely up to 12% more tenderness in the younger age group.

### The experience of chronic pain among adolescents: suffering and attempt to overcome pain? [^114jNQ6K]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Factors affecting pain management

Participants' experiences showed that a series of factors affect their choice and use of pain management strategies. These factors were gender, family education, and the subjective burden of pain.

Gender

Some participants believed that pain management strategies among girls are different from those among boys and noted that adolescents may choose physical or psychological strategies for pain management according to their gender. They also noted that reaction to pain also depends on gender so that girls usually have lower pain threshold. In this regard, two girls quoted:

Women have different personality traits. They sometimes express their problems and sometimes avoid such expression. This is also true for men; but men mostly avoid expressing their pain unless they cannot manage their emotions (P. 6).

Women have more difficult conditions because they have greater responsibility at home. On the other hand, men have higher resistance. Restlessness is less common among men and more common among women. Women cry (P. 7).

Some female participants noted that men and women differ from each other respecting their internal and external reactions to pain.

Boys are more resistant to emotional pain, while girls are more resistant to physical pain. In response to physical pain, boys are impatient and aggressive, while girls are calm but may get sad or depressed (P. 2).

Family education

Participants noted that family education and environment have significant role in pain tolerance and management. They highlighted that parents' responses to pain can be a model for adolescents. They also believed that birth rank can affect adolescents' pain perception and experience.

A child with a father who well tolerates pain will have greater pain tolerance. Moreover, I have greater pain tolerance to pain compared with my little brother because he has been reared in a way that shows lower tolerance (P. 9).

Family is very important. A person who has worked and experienced difficulties since childhood has greater tolerance (P. 7).

The subjective burden of pain

Participants noted that subjective perception and image of pain can affect pain tolerance.

In my opinion, the subjective burden of pain is more important than the pain itself. Therefore, we should tell a patient that he/she can overcome pain (P. 2).

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^1129iCpC]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our percentile curves confirm the results of previous studies; sensitivity to pressure increases with age, and, in contrast to previous results, the percentile curves visualize when this increase starts, when it ends, and, most notably, how small it is. Pressure sensitivity starts to increase with the age of 30 to 40 years and reaches its peak at the age of 75 years (Figures 3 and 4). The maximum difference is only one unit, which is the smallest change one individual can perceive within her- or himself. It is half as large as the MCID of the zero to ten pain rating scale, which is very frequently used for pain conditions but too seldomly used for induced pain. Some studies postulate that while the absolute MCID is two units, the relative MCID is 30%. In this case, the increase, which is the same on the finger as on the ear lobe regardless of the higher overall sensitivity on the ear lobe, would be more relevant on the ear lobe than on the finger. Nevertheless, it remains below individual perception.

Like the age-dependent increase, our percentile curves show that women indeed rate pressure higher than men, but the difference is very small. On the finger, it fluctuates between zero and 0.6 units depending on the age (Figure 5). On the ear lobe, it fluctuates between zero and 1.6 units (Figure 6). Again, this difference is always below the minimal clinically relevant difference and mostly even below individual perception. As the overlapping 95% confidence bands show, it is below statistical significance. Importantly, this is the case despite sufficient statistical power, as the confidence bands of the medians are narrower than one unit. In other words, the statistical precision of our percentile curves is higher than supraliminal human perception. Only in the ear lobe of men, we observed a meaningful increase of 2.1 units between 35 and 78 years (Figure 6). The increase of pain sensitivity in the women's ear lobe is neither relatively nor absolutely meaningful.

### Women experience greater heat pain adaptation and habituation than men [^116Phmc3]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

It is not clear how males and females cope with pain over time and how sensory and emotional qualities fluctuate from moment to moment, although studies of pain at discrete time points suggest that women are more pain sensitive than men. Therefore, we developed a new broader-based pain model that incorporates a temporally continuous assessment of multiple pain dimensions across sensory and affective dimensions, and normalized peak pain intensity to unmask sex differences that may otherwise be confounded by inter-individual variability in pain sensitivity. We obtained continuous ratings of pain, burning, sharp, stinging, cutting, and annoyance evoked by repeated prolonged noxious heat stimuli in 32 subjects. Strikingly, females reported more pain than males at the outset of the first exposure to pain, but then experienced less pain and annoyance than males as a painful stimulus was sustained and with repeated stimulation. Patterns of pain and annoyance attenuation in women resembled the attenuation of sharp, stinging and cutting sensations, whereas patterns of pain and annoyance in men resembled burning sensations. Taken together, these data demonstrate a prominent sex difference in the time course of pain. Notably only females demonstrate adaptation and habituation that allow them to experience less pain over time. These findings suggest a sexual dichotomy in mechanisms underlying pain intensity and annoyance that could involve specific quality-linked mechanisms. Importantly, temporal processing of pain differs between males and females when adjusted for sex differences in pain sensitivity. Our findings provide insight into sex differences in tonic and possibly chronic pains.

### Sex differences in experimental measures of pain sensitivity and endogenous pain inhibition [^11684tPT]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

IPT pain sensitivity

Mean values for the IPT pain sensitivity variables are displayed in Table 4 for the overall study sample as well as separately for men and women. The first MANCOVA revealed significant sex differences for IPT pain sensitivity while controlling for depressive symptoms and sleep quality (λ = 0.793, F = 3.67, P = 0.020). The follow up univariate F statistics showed there was a significant sex difference for IPT tolerance time (F = 10.48, P < 0.01) but not for ratings of pain intensity or pain unpleasantness. Although women tended to discontinue the IPT after a significantly shorter amount of time than did men, their ratings of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness were comparable (Figure 1A and B).

CPM effect at the forearm

Of the four cold water intensities used for tailoring the conditioning pain stimulus, the majority of participants used 12°C as their conditioning stimulus to achieve a moderate amount of pain (n = 28, 58%). Otherwise, 16°C was utilized for five individuals (10%), 8°C was utilized for eight individuals (17%), and 5°C for the remaining seven (15%). CPM did not significantly differ as a function of the temperature used to tailor the cold water conditioning stimulus (F = 1.99, P = 0.129). Furthermore, men and women did not significantly differ in the temperatures of the cold water needed to achieve a moderate amount of pain (χ² = 6.13, P = 0.106). This suggests that any sex difference in CPM is likely to be independent of the intensity of the tailored cold water conditioning stimulus.

Mean values for CPM are displayed in Table 4 for the overall study sample as well as separately for men and women. The second MANCOVA revealed significant sex differences for CPM while again controlling for depressive symptoms and sleep quality (λ = 0.696, F = 6.11, P = 0.002). Follow-up univariate F statistics showed significant sex differences for baseline PPTs (F = 6.45, P = 0.006), conditioned PPTs (F = 14.43, P < 0.001), and CPM (F = 5.53, P = 0.023). Women demonstrated significantly lower baseline and conditioned PPTs than men as well as significantly less CPM at the forearm according to percent change. These results suggest that women may have less-efficient endogenous pain inhibition than men (Figure 2A and B).

### Healthy women show more experimentally induced central sensitization compared with men [^113eyuXP]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Many chronic pain conditions show striking differences between men and women in key disease aspects, such as prevalence, duration, intensity of symptoms, or treatment efficacy. Several sociocultural, educational, biological, and aethiopathological factors contributing to chronic pain have been identified to differ between men and women. An important question regarding many of these factors is whether they differ before pain onset because factors that do differ might contribute to the increased vulnerability of women for chronic pain.

One important mechanism, observed to differ between men and women in certain chronic pain conditions, is central sensitization (CS), defined as an increased responsiveness of second-order neurons in the dorsal horn to normal or subthreshold afferent input. Yet, it is unknown whether CS differences are already present in healthy men and women, ie, before any potential pain chronification sets in. Because increased responsiveness of second-order neurons cannot be directly investigated in humans, proxy measurements of CS are used.,

Increased mechanical sensitivity adjacent to the primary area of noxious stimulation is one well-established proxy for measuring CS (CS proxy). It is typically recorded as secondary mechanical hyperalgesia (SMH) or dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA). Such measurements rely on cooperation and feedback from the tested person. Therefore, the measures are potentially subject to factors influencing response behaviour in the tested person, such as disposition, motivation, expectation, or interaction, with the experimenter that can vary between men and women. Studies investigating potential differences of subjective CS proxies between healthy men and women have so far been inconclusive. More objective CS proxies, such as the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR), are an alternative to investigate potential sex differences of CS.

The NWR is a polysynaptic spinal response to an external noxious stimulus resulting in involuntary muscle activation to withdraw the affected limb, which can be measured by surface electromyographical recording (sEMG). The NWR has been used to study spinal hyperexcitability in chronic pain patients and healthy volunteers. Its characteristics, including threshold and magnitude, do not differ between healthy men and women, and neither seem to be influenced by menstrual cycle phases. Importantly, supraspinal influences on the NWR, do not differ between men and women. In addition, this motivates the NWR for the investigation of potential sex-specific differences in CS.

### Clinical characteristics of chronic back pain as a function of gender and oral opioid use [^117Wif4X]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A cross-sectional analysis of data derived from patients with chronic spinal pain undergoing evaluation at a multidisciplinary pain treatment center was conducted.

Objective

To determine whether pain severity, psychological status, and physical disability differed as a function of gender and opioid use, and whether the clinical correlates of opioid use differed in women and men with chronic back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Gender differences in the experience of pain have been widely reported. For example, in the general population, several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than among men, and many experimental studies demonstrate lower pain thresholds and tolerances among women. In addition, recent evidence from studies of experimental and acute clinical pain suggests that responses to analgesic medications may differ in women and men.

Methods

The sample consisted of 240 patients (35% women) with low back, upper back, or neck pain undergoing evaluation for treatment at a multidisciplinary pain center. The patients were classified as opioid or nonopioid users on the basis of self-report and medical record review. All the patients completed a battery of clinical assessments, including measures of pain severity, psychological adjustment, self-reported disability, functional tasks, and pain tolerance. Analyses were conducted to examine clinical variables as a function of gender and opioid use.

Results

The results indicated that opioid use was associated with greater self-reported disability and poorer function in both women and men. However, the association of opioid use with affective distress differed between women and men. The women using opioids showed lower affective distress, whereas the opioid-using men reported greater affective distress. Opioid use was not associated with pain severity, although the women reported greater pain than men.

Conclusions

These findings indicate that both opioid use and gender are significant predictors of clinical status of patients with chronic spinal pain. More interesting, these two variables interact because opioid use was associated with increased affective distress among the men, but the reverse was true for the women. In addition, the women reported greater pain severity, which is consistent with some previous findings. Potential explanations for these findings are presented, and the practical implications are discussed.

### An evaluation of sex differences in psychological and physiological responses to experimentally-induced pain: a path analytic description [^116NyHhk]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

A cold pressor task (CPT) was used with 203 college students (112 women and 91 men) in a study of sex differences in pain response. Physiological measures were taken before and after pain induction, and sex-differentiating personality traits were assessed with the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ). The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was given with standard instructions prior to the CPT, and it was re-administered after the CPT with modified instructions to assess catastrophic thinking during the CPT. Hypotheses were formulated into an explanatory model that was evaluated by path analysis. Pain induction elevated blood pressures and cortisol levels for both sexes, but systolic blood pressure reactivity and cortisol response were greater in men, even with sex differences in CPT tolerance times controlled statistically. Post-CPT PCS scores were positively related to pain ratings and negatively related to tolerance, but baseline PCS scores did not predict tolerance or pain ratings. Pre-PCS scores were not well correlated with post-PCS scores (r = 0.46) and underestimated post-PCS scores, particularly for women. The Sex difference on the post-CPT PCS was largely attributable to the PAQ personality trait of Emotional Vulnerability. The differential results obtained from assessing catastrophizing before and after the CPT emphasized the importance of specifying the context in which catastrophizing is assessed (both timing and instructions). Theoretical considerations in the construct of catastrophizing are also highlighted, including, but not limited to, the confounding of variables such as pain intensity and unpleasantness.

### Women and the experience of pain and opioid use disorder: a literature-based commentary [^116whMxC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

It is generally understood that pain experience and opioid abuse have relied on male-dominated models. However, sex and gender play a role in both pain experience and opioid use disorder. Using the previously validated Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Sex and Gender Specific Health PubMed Advanced Search Tool, the authors used pertinent literature to develop this literature-based commentary on sex and gender differences in pain experience and opioid use disorder. Women report their experience of pain more frequently, have increased rates of diagnoses related to pain, have increased pain sensitivity, and have a variable response to pain and analgesia. This variable response is due to anatomic, physiologic, hormonal, psychological, and social factors that differ by sex and gender. Women have been found to be at greater risk for opioid abuse in all age groups. This may be due to the differences in pain experience, as well as sex and gender differences in prescribing patterns, cultural norms, and the increased likelihood to experience dependency and withdrawal. Approaches to the treatment of opioid use disorder are also subject to sex and gender differences-an area in need of further investigation.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^1157ETjr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The influence of gender and age on pressure sensitivity is negligible compared to the influence of chronic pain and central hyperalgesia. It might trigger discussions about gender stereotypes, but it has no clinical relevance.

### Sex differences in pain catastrophizing and its relation to the transition from acute pain to chronic pain [^112P359J]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we studied potential differences in pain catastrophizing between sexes. We showed that females catastrophize pain more often than males. Furthermore, our data showed that pain catastrophizing increased the risk of chronic pain in both males and females when chronic pain was defined as an NRS ≧ 1 at 90 days. When chronic pain was defined as an NRS ≧ 4 at 90 days, pain catastrophizing was associated with chronic pain in females. In males, the association was not statistically significant. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the relationship between pain catastrophizing, sex, and pain chronification in patients presenting in an emergency department with any cause of pain. Pain catastrophizing increased the risk of pain chronification, irrespective of sex. An intervention to reduce pain catastrophizing might thus reduce the risk of pain chronification, although this cannot be concluded based on our research.

Our finding that females tend to catastrophize more was consistent with previous studies. These studies showed that females reported higher levels of catastrophic thinking in both healthy people and chronic pain patients. Females reported more pain, a higher pain intensity, more frequent and longer episodes of pain, poorer pain-related outcomes, and lower pain tolerance. They used more emotion-based coping strategies whereas males used more problem focused ones. There were sex differences in pain due to socialization, social and cultural norms, and expectations regarding social roles. For example, males are expected to be stoic, minimizing, and enduring pain, which could lead to underreporting of pain and catastrophizing by males. Females reported pain sooner to reduce its impact as they were often fulfilling more roles, like taking care of children or elderly people, household, and work.

### The distribution and correlates of self-rated health in elderly Chinese: the China kadoorie biobank study [^117PDt6x]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Among the demographic variables, we found that older people were more likely to report better age-comparative SRH but similar global SRH, the results of age-comparative SRH were consistent with previous studies, but the results of global SRH were not entirely consistent with previous studies. When reporting global SRH, people may compare their current health status with that of their younger ages or with other younger people, but in the context of age-comparative SRH, they compared their health status with someone of similar ages. Survival bias is a possible explanation for better age-comparative SRH related to old age because those elderly people who participated in the study could have generally good health status compared to those who could not participate (e.g. because of premature death or severe diseases). Previous studies indicated that elderly people tended to overestimate their own heath or underestimate the health of others of their ages, and there may be a deterioration of judgment with increasing age or a healthy survivor effect. In addition, the perception of health status could be different in old people, the continuous reduction in the level of health expectations allows older people to better adapt to the aging process. We also found that men tended to report a good global SRH and better age-comparative SRH compared with women, which was consistent with most previous studies. Gender differences in SRH may be due to the differences in social status, social stress, family roles, pain tolerance and health expectations between men and women. Men in our study were more likely to have a higher education level, although we have controlled for education level in the models, residual confounding of socioeconomic status is still possible and we could not adequately adjust for other aspects of the socioeconomic inequalities between men and women. In addition, compared with women, men are more tolerant of various physical pains and more optimistic about health, and the gender differences in mental health status (e.g. women reporting higher probability of depression) have been well-established. Urban residents were more likely to report good/better SRH status in our study. The rural residents in our study were mostly engaged in agricultural work, had low social status and low income, and there were dramatic differences in living environment and medical conditions between urban and rural areas. Taken together, our study cannot fully explain the exact reasons for the gender and urban/rural differences in reporting health status, but since gender inequality and urban/rural health disparity are generally upstream determinants of socioeconomic status and health behaviors, our results further emphasize the importance of establishing social policy to achieve greater social and economic equality in society in order to reduce the health inequity.

### Gender bias in the observation of experimental pain [^115zzKZz]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine how men and women observe experimentally induced pain in male and female participants and to specifically determine the accuracy of observed pain ratings, the possible interactions between the sex of the viewer and the sex of the individual being observed, and the influence of gender role expectations on observed pain ratings. The sample comprised 29 participants (15 females). They each completed a battery of psychological questionnaires and viewed a presentation of 10 randomly ordered video clips. Each presentation consisted of 10 video clips, lasting 30s, of a participant (five males and five females) in the cold pressor task. The participants viewing the videos were asked to provide several ratings, including observed pain intensity and gender role related characteristics of the individual in the video. In terms of sex of the video participant, results indicated that viewers rated male videos as having less pain than female videos although the effect was small. Regarding sex of the viewer, results indicated that for both male and female videos, female viewers rated observed pain intensity significantly higher than did male viewers. In terms of accuracy, results indicated that on average, female video participants' pain was underestimated by 14 points, while male videos participants' pain was underestimated by 22 points (on a 0–100-point scale). Pain intensity ratings and pain tolerance from the participants in the videos did not differ significantly with respect to sex, though women had shorter tolerance times and higher pain ratings than men. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that expectations of gender related 'endurance of pain' significantly predicted ratings of both male and female videos. When endurance expectations were controlled, sex of the viewer no longer significantly predicted observed pain ratings. The 'willingness to report pain' variable was not a significant predictor of observed pain ratings. Our results show that women are perceived to have more pain than men, that there was a tendency by both sexes to underestimate pain in others, but men showed even greater underestimation, and that gender role expectations of pain endurance given by the video observers accounted for substantial variance in their ratings of pain in the videos.

### Age-related and sex-related changes in perfusion index in response to noxious electrical stimulation in healthy subjects [^116UtpMC]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Study population

Data were analyzed from 64 of the original 70 subjects. Six subjects were excluded because of technical failure. We categorized the participants into two groups, ie, an aged group (≥ 60 years) and a young group (< 60 years). Because 60 years is the retirement age in Japan, we chose this as the threshold for classification. In addition, we examined differences between men and women. Thus, we obtained four study groups, ie, aged men, aged women, young men, and young women. Demographic data for the 64 subjects are shown in Table 1.

Electrical stimulation

The mean values for minimum detection threshold, pain detection threshold, and pain tolerance are shown in Figure 1B. We observed a significant difference in the minimum detection threshold among the groups (F [1,3,63] = 6.19, P = 0.001); post hoc comparison revealed that the minimum detection threshold was higher in aged men than in aged women (P = 0.0224) and young women (P = 0.0007). The pain detection threshold was also significantly different between the groups (F [1,3,63], P = 0.0003), being higher in the young men than in the aged men (P = 0.0008) and aged women (P = 0.0007). We also observed a significant difference in pain tolerance between the groups (F [1,3,63] = 5.14, P = 0.0031). Pain tolerance was higher in young men compared with young women (P = 0.0074) and aged women (P = 0.0111; Figure 1B).

### Healthy women show more experimentally induced central sensitization compared with men [^1114wAvM]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Women more often experience chronic pain conditions than men. Central sensitization (CS) is one key mechanism in chronic pain that can differ between the sexes. It is unknown whether CS processes are already more pronounced in healthy women than in men. In 66 subjects (33 women), a thermal CS induction protocol was applied to the dorsum of one foot and a sham protocol to the other. Spatial extent [cm²] of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia (SMH) and dynamic mechanical allodynia were assessed as subjective CS proxy measures, relying on verbal feedback. Changes in nociceptive withdrawal reflex magnitude (NWR-M) and response rate (NWR-RR) recorded through surface electromyography at the biceps and rectus femoris muscles were used as objective CS proxies. The effect of the CS induction protocol on SMH was higher in women than in men (effect size 2.11 vs 1.68). Nociceptive withdrawal reflex magnitude results were statistically meaningful for women (effect size 0.31–0.36) but not for men (effect size 0.12–0.29). Differences between men and women were not meaningful. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex response rate at the rectus femoris increased in women after CS induction and was statistically different from NWR-RR in men (median differences of 13.7 and 8.4% for 120 and 140% reflex threshold current). The objective CS proxy differences indicate that dorsal horn CS processes are more pronounced in healthy women. The even larger sex differences in subjective CS proxies potentially reflect greater supraspinal influence in women. This study shows that sex differences are present in experimentally induced CS in healthy subjects, which might contribute to women's vulnerability for chronic pain.

### Effects of temperature on heat pain adaptation and habituation in men and women [^113PunXj]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

We recently reported that women report greater pain adaptation and habituation to moderately painful heat stimuli than men (Hashmi and Davis [16]); but slightly lower temperatures were needed to evoke moderate pain in the women. Hardy et al (1962) and LaMotte (1979) suggested that pain adaptation is most prominent at modest noxious heat temperatures and may occur at temperatures close to pain thresholds. Thus, as a follow-up to our previous study, we examined the role of absolute temperature in pain adaptation and habituation in men and women and assessed whether pain threshold impacts these findings. We hypothesised that pain adaptation and habituation would be more prominent at low and moderate temperatures, and that higher temperatures would induce pain adaptation and habituation in women but not in men. We further hypothesized that pain adaptation would not be correlated with pain thresholds. To test this, we obtained continuous ratings of pain evoked by 44.5–47.5°C stimuli applied to the dorsal foot of men and women. Each run consisted of three 30s stimuli at the same temperature with a 60s inter-stimulus interval. Women showed within-stimulus adaptation of total pain at all temperatures, but men showed significant adaptation to temperatures less than 47°C. There were no sex differences in inter-stimulus habituation and both men and women reported habituation to temperatures less than 46°C. Pain thresholds did not correlate with pain adaptation. These data highlight the temperature-sensitivity and sex differences of pain adaptation and habituation.

### Sex effects in the interaction of acute stress and pain perception [^116J8joB]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A reciprocity between the stress and the pain system is recognized; however, the manner by which sex affects this reciprocity is unclear. Understanding the interactions of stress, pain, and sex may shed light on the apparent women's vulnerability to chronic pain, which often coexists with increased distress, and to affective disorders, which often coexist with chronic pain. The study's aim was to examine the effect of acute, validated, psychosocial stress on pain perception and modulation of women and men in a controlled manner. Participants were 82 women and 66 men. Heat-pain threshold, heat-pain tolerance, and pain modulation by temporal summation of pain (TSP), and pain adaptation were measured before and after exposure to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) or to a sham task. The stress response was verified by perceived ratings of stress and anxiety, autonomic variables, and salivary cortisol. A significant stress response was obtained by the MIST among both sexes; however, women displayed a greater increase in perceived distress, and men displayed a greater increase in cortisol. Among women, TSP decreased and pain adaptation increased following the MIST, responses that were predicted by perceived distress levels. Among men, TSP increased following the MIST but was not predicted by the stress variables. In conclusion, acute stress manipulation seems to differentially affect both stress and pain responses of women and men: women exhibited stress-induced antinociception and men exhibited stress-induced pronociception. Higher perceived stress levels among women may trigger a temporary increase in pain inhibition mechanisms to serve evolutionary purposes.

### Age and gender as factors of pressure sensitivity of pain-free persons: are they meaningful? [^116ykmyk]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prior findings suggest that women and elderly persons are more sensitive to pressure than men and younger persons; however, the magnitudes of these differences are substantially inconsistent. We answered the question whether the higher sensitivity of women and elderly persons is quantitatively meaningful. Specifically, we investigated if it is large enough to hamper the diagnosis, classification and follow-up of pain conditions by clinicians.

Materials and Methods

From each age stratum (18–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, and > 80 years), 40 pain-free women and 40 pain-free men were recruited. They rated the intensity of pressure of ten Newtons over ten seconds on an analogue zero to ten rating scale. The pressure was applied on their middle fingers and ear lobes with a threshold algometer. Centile curves visualized the sex- and age-dependent fluctuation of pressure sensitivity.

Results

Over the entire age range from 20 to 80 years, the median curves fluctuated within the interval of less than two points. The distance between the median curves of men and women was also less than two points. On the average, the median difference was half a point on the finger (p = 0.249) and the ear lobe (p = 0.083).

Conclusion

Less than two points is below the minimal clinically important difference for a zero to ten analogue pain rating scale; differences smaller than one point are even below the resolution of the scale. Sex differences and age fluctuations of pressure sensitivity are negligible.

### Pain tolerance in persons with recognized and unrecognized myocardial infarction: a population-based, cross-sectional study [^117VQk5w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Additional analyses shown in Table S1 demonstrate that participants with unrecognized MI do not have a statistically significantly lower pain tolerance than those with no MI. It is, however, possible that persons with no MI have a pain tolerance intermediate to unrecognized and recognized MI, as Figure 2 indicates. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that it is patients with recognized MI who have an increased pain sensitivity compared with those without MI and with unrecognized MI. However, the main purpose of this article was to study differences between recognized and unrecognized MI.

Sex Differences

Women are more likely to present without chest pain or to have atypical symptoms in the setting of an acute MI 2, 49 and the proportion of unrecognized MI is larger in women compared with men. 8, 15, 50 Most studies of experimental pain show significant sex differences, although sometimes relatively minor and affected by numerous confounding variables. 51, 52 When differences are observed, they consistently show that women have higher sensitivity and lower tolerance to pain than men. 53, 54 It therefore seems contradictory that women have more unrecognized MIs.

As in previous studies, we found a higher proportion of unrecognized MIs in women and that women were less tolerant to pain than men. We found that the association between unrecognized MI and lower pain tolerance was stronger in women than in men, and statistically significant in women only, but the sex difference was not statistically significant (P for interaction = 0.14). It is possible that the larger proportion of unrecognized MIs in women is explained by the fact that they are more likely to have coronary disease misdiagnosed or dismissed because of deficient knowledge and more difficult diagnostics, and not because they do not experience symptoms of the MI. In addition, it might also be that women recognized as having an MI are those most sensitive to pain, presenting with the most severe symptoms, and therefore are more likely to receive a diagnosis. This can potentially explain the stronger association in women, as we have investigated pain sensitivity in those with unrecognized MI relative to those with recognized MI.

### Healthy women show more experimentally induced central sensitization compared with men [^114Pp71Z]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

This study found more experimentally induced central sensitization in women compared with men. This finding will potentially help to better understand sex-specific vulnerability for chronic pain.

### Gender, genetics, and analgesia: understanding the differences in response to pain relief [^11247wTe]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Females also show a higher incidence of acute postoperative pain. Females are also reported to have an increased sensitivity in a number of experimental pain models. This includes pain induced by electrical, thermal, mechanical, chemical stimuli, or more advanced, clinically relevant pain models such as the temporal summation of pain and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Temporal summation measures pain facilitation in response to repeated stimuli over a period of time. CPM measures a decrease in pain perception in response to a "conditioning pain stimulus". It is based on "pain inhibits pain" model and is used to assess endogenous antinociception. Responses are measured in terms of pain intensity scales such as the visual analog scale, self-reported unpleasantness rating, and in terms of threshold and tolerance. Threshold measures the time or intensity of stimulus at which the subject first reports pain perception. Tolerance is the maximum amount of pain stimulus the subject is able to withstand. In general, females display a lower pain threshold and tolerance to painful stimuli compared to males. Women show a greater temporal summation of pain (pain facilitation), whereas men show better pain modulation (pain inhibition).–Pain modulation through diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) has been found more efficient in men than in women. In a recent review by Hermans et al, nine of the 15 studies that compared CPM between males and females did not find any difference between the genders. The remaining six studies found that males demonstrated better CPM compared to females. Though evidence of gender difference in CPM is not compelling, those studies that show a difference consistently point toward greater CPM in males.

### Do people with musculoskeletal pain differ from healthy cohorts in terms of global measures of strength? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113g5EsP]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Strength was measured with free weights only in two studies with the same exercise (i.e. bench press). All other included studies assessed strength with weight machines (i.e. leg press, chest press, lat pulldown and pectoral machine). While the choice of weights machines was fairly consistent in our review, the included studies presented heterogeneity in strength measurement testing methods. The American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for exercise testing and prescriptionsuggests that dynamic strength should be measured with 1 repetition maximum – or multiple repetition maximum (≤ 5) to provide a fair reflection of individual strength. However, poor knowledge of exercise physiology principles in musculoskeletal research and healthcare professionals may be a barrier to implementing such recommendations, and further professional training may be needed. – Strength levels vary significantly between men and women, – and thus cohorts should be divided into separate groups according to their gender. In our review, 10 studies included mixed groups not accounting for gender differences. Poor reporting of relevant participants characteristics clearly limits the external validity of the findings (i.e. their generalizability or applicability into clinical practice), and accurate systematic synthesis of the available literature. This has been also identified in tendinopathy and chronic low back pain research, – with better depiction of participants characteristics in clinical studies being recommended in the CONSORT statement.

### Enhanced pain sensitivity among individuals with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: potential sex differences in central sensitization [^117XpB7N]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition commonly associated with increased pain, disability, and functional limitations. Given the poor correspondence between radiographic evidence and clinical pain, central sensitization has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying pain facilitation in knee OA. Sex may be a moderator of centrally mediated changes in knee OA pain; however, few studies have systematically assessed this. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine differences in peripheral and central sensitization in men and women with symptomatic knee OA, as well as to determine whether these differences vary across age (middle age versus older age).

Methods

Participants (n = 288) between the ages of 45 and 85 years completed a battery of quantitative sensory pain procedures assessing sensitivity to contact heat, cold pressor, mechanical pressure, and punctate stimuli. Differences in temporal summation (TS) were examined, as well as measures of clinical pain and functional performance.

Results

When compared to men, women exhibited greater sensitivity to multiple pain modalities (i.e., lower heat, cold, pressure thresholds/tolerances, greater TS of pain); however, there were no sex differences in clinical pain, with the exception of greater widespread pain observed in women. Although there were select age-related differences in pain sensitivity, sex differences in pain varied minimally across the age cohort.

Conclusion

Overall, these findings provide evidence for greater overall sensitivity to experimental pain in women with symptomatic knee OA compared to men, suggesting that enhanced central sensitivity may be an important contributor to pain in this group.

### Efficacy of a psychosocial pain management intervention for men and women with substance use disorders and chronic pain: a randomized clinical trial [^114QzcpK]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Chronic pain is common in those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and predicts poorer addiction treatment outcomes. A critical challenge for addiction treatment is to develop effective methods to improve pain-related and substance use-related outcomes for those in treatment for SUDs.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of an integrated behavioral pain management intervention (Improving Pain During Addiction Treatment [ImPAT]) for men and women with SUDs to treat pain, functioning, and substance use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized clinical trial, 8 sessions of ImPAT were compared with 8 sessions of a supportive psychoeducational control (SPC) condition for adults with pain treated at a large residential SUD treatment program. Follow-up occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A total of 1372 adults were screened, including 960 men and 412 women, and 510 adults were randomized, including 264 men and 246 women. The goal was to recruit approximately equal numbers of men and women to examine results separately in men and women. A total of 470 of 510 participants (92.2%) completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. Data were collected from October 3, 2011, to January 14, 2016. Data were analyzed from February 1, 2016, to May 1, 2020.

Interventions

ImPAT focused on how a psychosocial model of pain was associated with functioning and relapse prevention and provides skills to manage pain. SPC served as the active control condition and involved discussions of topics like nutrition and the course of addiction, which were intended to be relevant to the patient population and to have face validity but be distinct from the content of ImPAT.

Main Outcomes and Measurements

The primary outcomes were pain intensity, pain-related functioning, and behavioral pain tolerance at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were frequency of alcohol and drug use over 12 months.

Results

Of the 510 included participants, the mean (SD) age was 34.8 (10.3) years. A total of 133 men and 122 women were assigned to ImPAT, and a total of 131 men and 124 women were assigned to the SPC condition. Over 12 months of follow-up, randomization to the ImPAT intervention was associated with higher tolerance of pain among men, higher by a mean score of 0.11 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.18; p = 0.004; Cohen d = 0.40) at 3 months and by 0.07 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.19; p = 0.11; Cohen d = 0.25) at 12 months. Women receiving the ImPAT intervention experienced a reduction in pain intensity from 3 to 12 months, while women receiving the SPC condition experienced an increase in pain intensity, resulting in lower pain in the ImPAT condition by a mean score of 0.58 (95% CI, -0.07 to 1.22; p = 0.08; Cohen d = -0.22) at 12 months. No differences were found between the ImPAT and SPC conditions on alcohol or drug use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Behavioral pain management is not typically included in addiction treatment, but the present results indicate that this type of intervention was associated with better pain-related outcomes, including pain tolerance in men and pain intensity in women. Improvements in substance use-related outcomes beyond that achieved by treatment as usual were not observed. Treatment programs should consider providing psychosocial pain management services to augment standard addiction treatment.

### Excitatory and inhibitory pain mechanisms during the menstrual cycle in healthy women [^112ENtg3]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Sex differences in pain perception have been clearly documented in the literature during the last decades and it has been shown that women perceived more pain than men. Sex hormones (SHs) are thought to be one of the main mechanisms which explain sex differences in pain. Pain is a dynamic phenomenon involving both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Previous studies have verified the effect of SH on excitatory mechanisms but not on endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The main objective of this study was to establish if pain perception and diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) vary across the menstrual cycle (MC). Thirty-two healthy women with a regular MC were tested three times across their MC (days 1–3, days 12–14 and days 19–23). Experimental pain consisted of two tonic heat pain stimulations (thermode) separated by a 2-min cold pressor test (CPT) (conditioning stimulus activating DNIC). Pain ratings were measured with a visual analogue scale. Heat pain threshold, pain tolerance and mean pain intensity during both the 2-min thermode test and CPT did not vary throughout the MC. However, we found significantly more pain inhibition (DNIC effectiveness) during the ovulatory phase compared to the menstrual and luteal phases (p = 0.05). The main finding of this study is the observation that only inhibitory mechanisms (DNIC analgesia) and not excitatory pain mechanisms vary throughout the MC, where women have greater DNIC in the ovulatory phase. The higher occurrence of pain and lower pain threshold previously reported during the MC could be related to a reduction in endogenous pain control mechanisms.

### Catastrophizing as a mediator of sex differences in pain: differential effects for daily pain versus laboratory-induced pain [^116jbfDq]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Sex differences in the experience of pain have been widely reported, with females generally reporting more frequent clinical pain and demonstrating greater pain sensitivity. However, the mechanisms underpinning such differences, while subject to intense speculation, are not well-characterized. Catastrophizing is a cognitive and affective process that relates strongly to enhanced reports of pain and that varies as a function of sex. It is thus a prime candidate to explain sex differences; indeed, several prior studies offer evidence that controlling for catastrophizing eliminates the gap between men and women in reported pain. We recruited 198 healthy young adults (115 female) who took part in laboratory studies of pain responses, including thermal pain, cold pain, and ischemic pain, and who also completed questionnaires assessing catastrophizing, mood, and day-to-day painful symptoms (e.g. headache, backache). Women reported greater levels of catastrophizing, more recent painful symptoms, and demonstrated lower pain thresholds and tolerances for noxious heat and cold relative to men. Mediational analyses suggested that after controlling for negative mood, catastrophizing mediated the sex difference in recent daily pain but did not mediate the much larger sex differences in pain threshold and tolerance. These findings highlight the role of catastrophizing in shaping pain responses, as well as illuminating potentially important differences between experimental pain assessment and the clinical experience of pain.

### Pain tolerance as a predictor of outcome following multidisciplinary treatment for chronic pain: differential effects as a function of sex [^113Bd3xr]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Sex-related differences in the experience of clinical and experimental pain have been widely reported. Females are at elevated risk for developing several chronic pain conditions and women demonstrate greater sensitivity to noxious stimulation in the laboratory. However, relationships between responses to experimental noxious stimuli and the experience of clinical pain have not been well characterized. One previous study of healthy adults indicated that pain threshold and tolerance were associated with clinical pain among women but not men (i.e. females with lower pain threshold and tolerance reported more clinical pain). In the present investigation, relationships between pain tolerance and outcomes of treatment for chronic pain were evaluated in a sex-dependent manner. Ischemic pain tolerance was assessed prior to treatment in 171 chronic pain patients completing a pain management program. Outcomes were measured as changes in pain severity, affect, and pain-related disability. Over the course of treatment, women demonstrated greater improvement in pain-related disability while men showed more reduction in pain. Ischemic pain tolerance was related to outcome in a sex-specific fashion. Women with higher pain tolerances showed greater improvement in pain, more reduction in pain-related interference, and more increases in activity level than women with lower pain tolerances. In contrast, pain tolerance was not associated with positive treatment outcomes among men. These results indicate that experimental pain responses may be most clinically relevant for women, and that sex differences may exist in the determinants of pain-treatment outcomes.

### A systematic literature review of 10 years of research on sex / gender and experimental pain perception-part 1: are there really differences between women and men? [^1165gebf]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize and critically appraise the results of 10 years of human laboratory research on pain and sex/gender. An electronic search strategy was designed by a medical librarian and conducted in multiple databases. A total of 172 articles published between 1998 and 2008 were retrieved, analyzed, and synthesized. The first set of results (122 articles), which is presented in this paper, examined sex difference in the perception of laboratory-induced thermal, pressure, ischemic, muscle, electrical, chemical, and visceral pain in healthy subjects. This review suggests that females (F) and males (M) have comparable thresholds for cold and ischemic pain, while pressure pain thresholds are lower in F than M. There is strong evidence that F tolerate less thermal (heat, cold) and pressure pain than M but it is not the case for tolerance to ischemic pain, which is comparable in both sexes. The majority of the studies that measured pain intensity and unpleasantness showed no sex difference in many pain modalities. In summary, 10 years of laboratory research have not been successful in producing a clear and consistent pattern of sex differences in human pain sensitivity, even with the use of deep, tonic, long-lasting stimuli, which are known to better mimic clinical pain. Whether laboratory studies in healthy subjects are the best paradigm to investigate sex differences in pain perception is open to question and should be discussed with a view to enhancing the clinical relevance of these experiments and developing new research avenues.

### Sex differences in temporal summation of pain and aftersensations following repetitive noxious mechanical stimulation [^116NpBGc]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Several studies demonstrate that women are more sensitive to experimental pain than men. In addition, women exhibit greater temporal summation of heat and mechanically evoked pain. Since temporal summation of pain is centrally mediated, its greater expression in women suggests a central nociceptive hyperexcitability relative to men. The purpose of this study was to pursue this theory, by further assessing sex differences in (1) temporal summation of mechanically evoked pain, and (2) aftersensations following repetitive noxious stimulation. Sixteen series of 10 repetitive, mildly noxious, mechanical stimuli were applied to the fingers of 25 women and 25 age-matched men. The subjects rated the pain intensity and unpleasantness caused by the first, fifth and tenth stimulus in the series, as well as their aftersensations 15 s and 1 min following the end of stimulation. Data were analyzed by three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. Pain and unpleasantness ratings increased with repetition of stimulation (P < 0.0001). Temporal summation of pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings were more pronounced in women than men (P < 0.0001). In addition, significant temporal summation occurred only with 2 s interstimulus interval for men (P < 0.0005) but with 2 and 5 s interstimulus interval for women (P < 0.0001). Moreover, women provided greater ratings for the intensity and the unpleasantness of aftersensations (P < 0.0005) and reported painful aftersensations at greater frequency (P < 0.05) Greater temporal summation of pain and aftersensations in women suggests that their central processing of nociceptive input may be more easily upregulated into pathological hyperexcitability, possibly accounting for the higher prevalence of various chronic pain conditions among women.

### Age, sex, body mass index, education, and social support influence functional results after total knee arthroplasty [^116akL8v]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The TKA has been shown to lead to dramatic improvements in the functioning and quality of life of patient with OA. Unfortunately, not all patients do well and are satisfied with the results. The incidence of dissatisfaction or suboptimal outcome after TKA varies in the literature. Variations in reporting may be due to the wide range of questionnaires used and lack of consensus among physicians how to use them. In our study, we prospectively evaluated the effect of patient's factors such as age, gender, educational level, social support, and BMI on the outcome after TKA.

The influence of patient's gender on self-reported results after TKA remains an important issue. Our study presents significant differences in knee and overall function between genders before and 12 months after TKA. The WOMAC scores were significantly worse in women as preoperative and at 1 year follow-up. Our review of recent literature reveals that women demonstrate lower knee function and have more severe pain preoperatively.- There are some differences in postoperative scores favoring men, and showing no difference in functional outcome between men and women. The degree of improvement in postoperative scores generally favor women. -, However, women don't reach the same final functional level as men. The same findings are in SF-12 scoring system. Women begin and end with lower scores than men. According to preoperative WOMAC and SF-12 scores, men are more likely to choose surgery earlier in the disease, which allows them to achieve better functional results.

Due to increasing life expectancy and general health improvement, age of patients who would benefit from TKA is growing. Still much clinical controversy exists with respect to age and the risk of surgery. Family physicians, rheumatologists, and surgeons are confronted with weighing the risks and benefits of TKA for older patients. We compared pre- and postoperative results in 2 groups differing by age. Age cutoff was 75 years. The difference was significant in preoperative WOMAC pain and in SF-12 mental function domains. The patient group ≤ 75 years demonstrated lower mental function and had more pain in their knee. Possible explanation for this could be that older people may tolerate higher pain level. We don't see any statistical differences between groups 12 months after surgery.- It means that age should not be a barrier in considering surgery.

### Sex differences in experimental measures of pain sensitivity and endogenous pain inhibition [^112cMr1T]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that increased pain sensitivity and disruption of endogenous pain inhibitory processes may account, at least in part, for the greater prevalence and severity of chronic pain in women compared to men. However, previous studies addressing this topic have produced mixed findings. This study examined sex differences in pain sensitivity and inhibition using quantitative sensory testing (QST), while also considering the influence of other important factors such as depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Healthy men (n = 24) and women (n = 24) each completed a QST battery. This battery included an ischemic pain task (IPT) that used a submaximal effort tourniquet procedure as well as a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) procedure for the assessment of endogenous pain inhibition. Prior to QST, participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Analyses revealed significant sex differences for the ischemic pain task and the conditioned pain modulation procedure, such that women tolerated the ischemic pain for a shorter amount of time and demonstrated less pain inhibition compared with men. This remained true even when accounting for sex differences in depressive symptoms and sleep quality. The results of this study suggest that women may be more pain sensitive and possess less-efficient endogenous pain inhibitory capacity compared with men. Whether interventions that decrease pain sensitivity and enhance pain inhibition in women ultimately improve their clinical pain outcomes is an area of research that deserves additional attention in the future.

### Differences in electrical stimulation thresholds between men and women [^117XgLMo]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of skeletal muscle is used in a variety of clinical settings in healthy and unhealthy subjects of both sexes. Although women generally present larger amounts of subcutaneous adipose tissue than men, which could limit current flow to the stimulated muscle, sex-related differences in ES current levels have not been clearly demonstrated to date. We report data from healthy men and women.

Methods

Sensory (current perception), motor (minimal knee extension torque production), and supramotor thresholds (10% of the maximal voluntary knee extension torque) and perceived pain during surface ES of the quadriceps femoris muscle were investigated in 40 healthy volunteers (20 men, 20 women).

Results

Sensory threshold was lower in women than in men (-43%; p < 0.001). Similarly, female muscles required lower current amplitudes to attain the supramotor threshold (-17%; p < 0.01). The Visual Analogue Scale pain score was significantly greater in women than in men at motor threshold (+112%; p < 0.01) but not at supramotor threshold (+36%; p > 0.05).

Interpretation

Collectively, our data demonstrate higher sensory and supramotor excitability to surface ES in female subjects and provide further evidence for a neurophysiological explanation for more pronounced pain perception in women. These observations may help clinicians to better understand the sex-specific response to ES and to design more rational stimulation treatments with the ultimate goal of optimizing patient care and safety.

### Sex differences in osteoarthritis prevalence, pain perception, physical function and therapeutics [^114fTCst]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Women have a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) and worse clinical courses than men. However, the underlying factors and therapeutic outcomes of these sex-specific differences are incompletely researched. This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding sex differences in OA prevalence, risk factors, pain severity, functional outcomes, and use and response to therapeutics.

Methods

PubMed database was used with the title keyword combinations "{gender OR sex} AND osteoarthritis" plus additional manual search of the included papers for pertinent references, yielding 212 references. Additional references were added and 343 were reviewed for appropriateness.

Results

Globally, women account for 60% of people with osteoarthritis, with a greater difference after age 40. The higher risk for women may be due to differences in joint anatomy, alignment, muscle strength, hormonal influences, obesity, and/or genetics. At the same radiographic severity, women have greater pain severity than men, which may be explained by biologically distinct pain pathways, differential activation of central pain pathways, differences in pain sensitivity, perception, reporting, and coping strategies. Women have greater limitations of physical function and performance than men independent of BMI, OA severity, injury history, and amount of weekly exercise. Women also have greater use of analgesic medications than men but less use of arthroplasty and poorer prognosis after surgical interventions.

Conclusions

The recognition of sex differences in OA manifestations and management could guide tailoring of sex-specific treatment protocols, and analysis of sex as a biological variable in future research would enhance development of precision medicine.

### Modulation of pain by estrogens [^111oEuaU]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly apparent that women suffer a disproportionate amount of pain during their lifetime compared to men. Over the past 15 years, a growing number of studies have suggested a variety of causes for this sex difference, from cellular to psychosocial levels of analysis. From a biological perspective, sexual differentiation of pain appears to occur similarly to sexual differentiation of other phenomena: it results in large part from organizational and activational effects of gonadal steroid hormones. The focus of this review is the activational effects of a single group of ovarian hormones, the estrogens, on pain in humans and animals. The effects of estrogens (estradiol being the most commonly examined) on experimentally induced acute pain vs. clinical pain are summarized. For clinical pain, the review is limited to a few syndromes for which there is considerable evidence for estrogenic involvement: migraine, temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and arthritis. Because estrogens can modulate the function of the nervous, immune, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems, estrogenic modulation of pain is an exceedingly complex, multi-faceted phenomenon, with estrogens producing both pro- and antinociceptive effects that depend on the extent to which each of these systems of the body is involved in a particular type of pain. Forging a more complete understanding of the myriad ways that estrogens can ameliorate vs. facilitate pain will enable us to better prevent and treat pain in both women and men.
