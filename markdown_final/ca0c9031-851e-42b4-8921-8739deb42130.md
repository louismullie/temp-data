## Question

What is the role of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about MRI's role in multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including how MRI fulfills dissemination in space and time, the evolution of diagnostic criteria, practical acquisition protocols, differential diagnosis and red flags, special populations, and the clinico-radiological paradox with emerging biomarkers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that MS remains a clinical diagnosis and MRI's role as a paraclinical tool. Then, I should verify how MRI operationalizes dissemination in space and time within the McDonald framework. Next, I will review the evolution from 2001 to 2017 and the 2024 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus updates. After that, I need to check standardized acquisition protocols and the judicious use of gadolinium. I will then examine differential diagnosis, red flags, and common mimics. I should also consider special populations and contexts, including pediatric, older adults, and progressive MS. Finally, I will appraise the clinico-radiological paradox and promising advanced MRI biomarkers, and close with practical clinical takeaways and caveats to avoid misdiagnosis [^1121VC7p] [^112iWhrK].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: MS is a clinical diagnosis that requires objective evidence of dissemination in space and time, and MRI serves as the most sensitive paraclinical test to demonstrate DIS and DIT while excluding alternative diagnoses; I should double-check that this principle is consistent across authoritative sources, which it is, including the 2017 McDonald criteria and the 2024 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus [^113YdWxD] [^115NVKLJ] [^115yeq7M].

> Now, I will examine dissemination in space; wait, let me verify the anatomic regions and lesion counts. Traditionally, DIS required at least one lesion in at least two of four characteristic regions: periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord; the 2024 consensus adds the optic nerve as a fifth region, so lesions in at least four of these five regions can now fulfill DIS, with the caveat that periventricular lesions generally require more than one for specificity, and symptomatic lesions can count toward DIS in appropriate clinical contexts [^115NVKLJ] [^113YdWxD] [^117NG175].

> Next, I should review dissemination in time; hold on, I should verify the current rules. DIT can be satisfied in two ways: the presence of both gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions on a single MRI, indicating asynchronous inflammatory activity, or a new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI; importantly, symptomatic lesions can be used to demonstrate DIT in the 2017 revision, which I need to ensure I state correctly [^113YdWxD] [^115NVKLJ].

> I will now examine the evolution of diagnostic criteria; let me think about the key milestones. The 2001 International Panel criteria formally integrated MRI into MS diagnosis, the 2005 and 2010 revisions simplified DIS/DIT and allowed a single MRI to demonstrate DIT in select cases, and the 2017 McDonald criteria further permitted symptomatic lesions to count toward DIS/DIT and allowed CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for DIT in CIS when DIS is present; the 2024 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus expands DIS regions to include the optic nerve and emphasizes standardized acquisition and interpretation to improve specificity [^113LtoZe] [^112Hum4q] [^117P77yN] [^113YdWxD] [^115NVKLJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRI alone being sufficient; I should confirm the principle of "no better explanation". Accurate diagnosis requires exclusion of mimics and attention to MRI red flags; MAGNIMS has long emphasized recognizing atypical patterns and features that suggest alternative diagnoses, and the 2024 consensus reiterates the need to integrate clinical context, standardized protocols, and expert interpretation to minimize misdiagnosis [^1131uXbu] [^1156pwM2] [^115NVKLJ].

> Next, I should review standardized MRI acquisition; wait, I need to ensure I specify the core sequences and coverage. Minimum field strength is 1.5T, with 3T preferred when available; essential sequences include 3D FLAIR for the brain, pre- and post-contrast T1, T2-weighted imaging, and dedicated spinal cord imaging when indicated; susceptibility-weighted imaging or similar is recommended to assess the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions, and fat-suppressed orbital imaging is advised when optic nerve involvement is suspected; 3D acquisitions improve lesion detection and enable reproducible quantification, which is crucial for longitudinal monitoring [^114iDRcn] [^115NVKLJ] [^1175uYGU].

> I need to check the role and risks of gadolinium; let me reconsider the balance between diagnostic yield and safety. Gadolinium helps identify active lesions for DIT and treatment monitoring, but macrocyclic agents are preferred over linear agents due to gadolinium retention concerns; use should be judicious, for example at diagnosis, when high lesion burden obscures new activity, when clinical relapse is suspected but not confirmed, or when treatment response or safety must be verified, with attention to special contexts such as pregnancy and breastfeeding [^114iDRcn] [^114Y8zKs] [^115NVKLJ].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis and MRI red flags; hold on, I should verify the most common mimics and their distinguishing features. Small vessel ischemia, migraine, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, anti-MOG disease, and other inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, and genetic conditions can mimic MS; red flags include symmetric confluent white matter disease, extensive posterior fossa or callosal lesions, longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, and atypical enhancement patterns; careful pattern recognition and, when needed, serologic testing help avoid misclassification, and updated MAGNIMS guidance provides a pragmatic framework for distinguishing MS from its mimics [^1156pwM2] [^115HEn6K] [^117AzQgx].

> But wait, what about special populations; I should confirm pediatric, older adult, and progressive MS considerations. In children, adult DIS/DIT criteria generally perform well, but at least one black hole and one periventricular lesion at baseline increase specificity; in older adults or those with vascular risk factors, more stringent thresholds are advised to mitigate false positives; for progressive MS, the 2017 criteria retain distinct provisions requiring 12 months of progression plus imaging or CSF evidence, though emerging data question the need for separate criteria and emphasize early neurodegeneration across phenotypes [^1175uYGU] [^113YdWxD] [^114Mtxf7] [^116TEJb6].

> Next, I should review the clinico-radiological paradox and emerging biomarkers; hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied MRI perfectly predicts disability, which it does not. Conventional lesion counts correlate only modestly with clinical outcomes, prompting development of advanced MRI biomarkers such as the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions indicating smoldering inflammation, quantitative brain and spinal cord atrophy, and myelin water imaging; these markers are promising but require standardization and validation before routine clinical adoption, and machine learning approaches may eventually integrate multimodal imaging for better prognostication [^113uZgKd] [^115ZU4Fd] [^115NVKLJ] [^1121VC7p].

> I should double-check practical clinical takeaways to ensure they are actionable. MRI enables earlier diagnosis after a CIS when DIS and DIT are demonstrated, informs prognosis via lesion burden and location, guides treatment selection and escalation by revealing subclinical activity, and supports safety monitoring for complications such as PML; however, I need to emphasize that MRI must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid overdiagnosis, and that standardized protocols and expert readers are essential for accuracy and comparability over time [^113YdWxD] [^111yzmzC] [^114aBQVM] [^116wvqpu].

> Finally, let me verify the key caveats so we do not overstate MRI's standalone accuracy. Systematic reviews show that MRI alone has imperfect sensitivity and specificity for early MS, especially when applied outside typical CIS presentations, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical judgment, exclude mimics, and, when uncertain, observe and repeat imaging rather than forcing a premature diagnosis; this balanced approach minimizes both under- and overdiagnosis while preserving the opportunity for timely, appropriate disease-modifying therapy [^111DbdBg] [^113wS7Lk] [^112iWhrK].

---

MRI is central to MS diagnosis by enabling **early detection** of dissemination in space and time [^113YdWxD], often after a single clinical episode [^116TUHWn]. It is the **most sensitive** tool for detecting demyelinating lesions [^116KV111] and is embedded in the McDonald criteria [^113YdWxD], allowing diagnosis without a second clinical attack when MRI shows typical lesions and dissemination in time [^117P77yN]. MRI also excludes mimics [^115HEn6K] and guides treatment by revealing subclinical activity [^111yzmzC], but must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid misdiagnosis [^112iWhrK] [^111DbdBg].

## Historical evolution of MRI in MS diagnosis

MRI has evolved from a research tool to a **core diagnostic modality** in MS:

- **1980s**: MRI first showed MS lesions, enabling visualization of demyelination in vivo [^114pMKCT].
- **2001**: McDonald criteria formally integrated MRI to demonstrate dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) [^113LtoZe].
- **2010**: Simplified MRI criteria allowed earlier diagnosis after a single clinical episode [^117P77yN].
- **2017**: Further refinements allowed cortical lesions to support DIS and CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for DIT in some cases [^113YdWxD].
- **2024**: MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus added the optic nerve as a fifth region for DIS and emphasized standardized protocols and advanced sequences [^115NVKLJ].

---

## MRI criteria for MS diagnosis

The McDonald criteria require **evidence of DIS and DIT**, which MRI can provide:

| **Criterion** | **Mri evidence** |
|-|-|
| Dissemination in space (DIS) | ≥ 1 lesion in ≥ 2 of 4 characteristic regions: periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord (optic nerve added in 2024) [^113YdWxD] [^115NVKLJ] |
| Dissemination in time (DIT) | - Simultaneous gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions <br/> - Or a new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI [^111d1ooc] |

---

MRI can substitute for clinical evidence, enabling diagnosis after a single clinical episode if **DIS and DIT are demonstrated** [^117NG175] [^117TkMhJ].

---

## MRI sequences and protocols

Standardized MRI protocols are essential for **accurate diagnosis and monitoring**:

- **Brain MRI**: 3D FLAIR, T2-weighted, pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences are core [^1175uYGU].
- **Spinal MRI**: Recommended to detect asymptomatic cord lesions and support DIS [^1175uYGU].
- **Advanced sequences**: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for central vein sign [^115NVKLJ], double inversion recovery (DIR) for cortical lesions, and myelin water imaging are increasingly used [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of MRI findings

MRI findings have **major clinical implications**:

- **Early diagnosis**: MRI enables earlier diagnosis, facilitating timely initiation of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) [^113YdWxD] [^117TkMhJ].
- **Prognosis**: Higher lesion burden, brainstem/cord lesions, and early atrophy predict faster disability progression [^115PFbXA] [^113uZgKd].
- **Monitoring**: MRI detects subclinical activity, guiding treatment adjustments and safety monitoring [^111yzmzC] [^116y86ye].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its utility, MRI has **limitations**:

- **Specificity**: MRI lesions are not pathognomonic; mimics like small vessel disease, migraine, and other inflammatory disorders can confound diagnosis [^1156pwM2] [^115HEn6K].
- **Sensitivity**: Early or subtle lesions may be missed, especially at lower field strengths or with suboptimal protocols [^111DbdBg].
- **Interpretation**: Requires expertise to distinguish typical MS lesions from mimics and artifacts [^116tEMuf].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances aim to **improve diagnostic accuracy and specificity**:

- **Central vein sign (CVS)**: Highly specific for MS, helping differentiate from mimics [^115ZU4Fd].
- **Paramagnetic rim lesions**: Indicate smoldering inflammation and may predict progression [^notfound].
- **Quantitative MRI**: Automated lesion quantification and brain volume measures are entering clinical practice [^117VBU3U].
- **Artificial intelligence**: Machine learning may enhance lesion detection and prognostication [^1121VC7p].

---

MRI is indispensable in MS diagnosis, providing **objective evidence of DIS and DIT** [^113YdWxD] and enabling earlier, more accurate diagnosis. It also informs prognosis and guides therapy, but must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid misdiagnosis [^112iWhrK].

### Role of magnetic resonance imaging within diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis [^116TUHWn]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been improved in recent decades with the incorporation of paraclinical investigations in diagnostic workup. In the last 15 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an especially valuable tool for supporting MS diagnosis, and specific imaging criteria became fundamental to the guidelines for the diagnosis of MS published in 2001 by an international panel (IP). The new IP criteria include MRI evidence of dissemination in space and time, making it possible to diagnose MS after a single clinical episode. This review considers current evidence concerning the reliability of the new IP criteria for the diagnosis of relapsing-onset MS, discusses strengths and weaknesses of the criteria, and outlines areas which may need modification or should be the focus of future research directed toward improving diagnostic accuracy. It also makes practical recommendations when using MRI and the IP criteria in MS diagnosis, especially in patients with clinically isolated syndromes or atypical presentations. The IP criteria are timely and concrete and introduce an important concept to MS diagnosis. Future modifications, based on emerging evidence, should further facilitate their implementation and improve their accuracy.

### The role of MRI in the diagnosis of MS [^1131Yuqh]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used imaging technique in the investigation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although MS remains a clinical diagnosis, MRI has become an invaluable tool in understanding and monitoring the disease, and is commonly used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Various imaging techniques can be used but T2-weighted brain imaging remains the standard tool. The officially endorsed imaging criteria for MS places greater emphasis on the spatial and temporal distribution of lesions than on their individual appearance. This review focuses on the more typical findings in MS, and considers the current role of MRI in the diagnosis.

### Evidence-based guidelines: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in multiple sclerosis – establishing disease prognosis and monitoring patients [^111yzmzC]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The role of MRI in the assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS) goes far beyond the diagnostic process. MRI techniques can be used as regular monitoring to help stage patients with MS and measure disease progression. MRI can also be used to measure lesion burden, thus providing useful information for the prediction of long-term disability. With the introduction of a new generation of immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of MS, MRI also makes an important contribution to the monitoring of treatment, and can be used to determine baseline tissue damage and detect subsequent repair. This use of MRI can help predict treatment response and assess the efficacy and safety of new therapies. In the second part of the MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS) network's guidelines on the use of MRI in MS, we focus on the implementation of this technique in prognostic and monitoring tasks. We present recommendations on how and when to use MRI for disease monitoring, and discuss some promising MRI approaches that may be introduced into clinical practice in the near future.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent findings from the application of MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (MS), and to review the insights into disease pathophysiology and the utility of MRI for monitoring treatment response.

Recent Findings

New evidence from the application of MRI in patients with clinically isolated syndromes has guided the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, which has simplified their clinical use while preserving accuracy. Other MRI measures (e.g., cortical lesions and central vein signs) may improve diagnostic specificity, but their assessment still needs to be standardized, and their reliability confirmed. Novel MRI techniques are providing fundamental insights into the pathological substrates of the disease and are helping to give a better understanding of its clinical manifestations. Combined clinical-MRI measures of disease activity and progression, together with the use of clinically relevant MRI measures (e.g., brain atrophy) might improve treatment monitoring, but these are still not ready for the clinical setting.

Summary

Advances in MRI technology are improving the diagnostic work-up and monitoring of MS, even in the earliest phases of the disease, and are providing MRI measures that are more specific and sensitive to disease pathological substrates.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis [^115ydNYw]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

MRI provides multiple uses and applications in multiple sclerosis(MS). The basic features of the MRI-detected lesions, including the underlying pathology, are discussed. MRI allows assessment of the normal-appearing white and gray matter, and neuronal tract and functional system disturbances. An overview of the clinical significance of these MRI measures is included, as a basis for understanding their role as outcome measures in clinical trials. MRI recently assumed greater importance in its role in establishing an earlier diagnosis of MS after a first clinical event, and in monitoring subclinical disease before or subsequent to the formal diagnosis. The background to these applications and practical issues are discussed.

### Overview of magnetic resonance imaging for management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in everyday practice [^113qRxdi]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis/differential diagnosis of patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) is widely accepted, adoption of MRI into clinical practice to monitor disease evolution remains a work in progress. However, an accumulating body of evidence points to a central role for MRI in managing patients with relapsing-remitting MS along the disease continuum. Routine MRI surveillance provides insight into disease activity that is not evident clinically and this information, in turn, can be used to inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions. In Europe, practical guidelines have been developed to reduce the heterogeneity of imaging (both intracentre and intercentre) and improve the quality of MRI assessment and interpretation. Aimed at the general neurologist, this review explores some of the issues associated with MRI and examines evidence supporting its use for routine monitoring of MS patients in everyday practice.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^111xLbi1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent changes in the understanding and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased the role of MRI in supporting diagnosis and disease monitoring. However, published guidelines on the use of MRI in MS do not translate easily into different clinical settings and considerable variation in practice remains. Here, informed by published guidelines for the use of MRI in MS, we identified a clinically informative MRI protocol applicable in a variety of clinical settings, from district general hospitals to tertiary centres.

Methods

MS specialists geographically representing the UK National Health Service and with expertise in MRI examined existing guidelines on the use of MRI in MS and identification of challenges in their applications in various clinical settings informed the formulation of a feasible MRI protocol.

Results

We identified a minimum set of MRI information, based on clinical relevance, as well as on applicability to various clinical settings. This informed the selection of MRI acquisitions for scanning protocols, differentiated on the basis of their purpose and stage of the disease, and indication of timing for scans. Advice on standardisation of MRI requests and reporting, and proposed timing and frequency of MRI scans were generated.

Conclusions

The proposed MRI protocol can adapt to a range of clinical settings, aiding the impetus towards standardisation of practice and offering an example of research-informed service improvement to support optimisation of resources. Other neurological conditions, where a gap still exists between published guidelines and their clinical implementation, may benefit from this same approach.

### Future MRI tools in multiple sclerosis [^1134JDJQ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely sensitive in detecting multiple sclerosis (MS)-related abnormalities. As a consequence, it has become an established tool to diagnose the disease and to monitor its evolution. In patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS, MRI has been formally included in the diagnostic work up and ad hoc criteria have been proposed and are updated on a regular basis. However, in patients with definite MS, the strength of the relationship between conventional MRI findings and subsequent clinical manifestations of the disease remains modest. This is likely due to the relatively lack of specificity of conventional MRI to the heterogeneous pathological substrates of the disease and its inability to provide accurate estimates of such a damage outside focal lesions as well as to define the mechanisms through which the central nervous system recovers after tissue injury has occurred. Non-conventional MRI techniques offer new biomarkers more closely linked to the pathological features of the disease, which are likely to contribute to overcome, at least partially, these limitations. This review summarizes how MRI has improved our ability to diagnose MS and to predict its course, as well as how it is changing our understanding of the factors associated with the accumulation of irreversible disability in this condition.

### 2024 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^115NVKLJ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

MRI plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. We discuss the expanded role of MRI in the 2024 McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, which include the optic nerve as a fifth anatomical location, in addition to the periventricular, juxtacortical or cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can now be confirmed when the criteria of dissemination in space are fulfilled with the detection of typical lesions in at least four locations without additional evidence. We recommend appropriate imaging strategies and MRI acquisition protocols for all aspects of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including fat-saturated sequences for detection of symptomatic optic nerve lesions. Diagnostic imaging should always cover the brain and spinal cord and include susceptibility-sensitive sequences for the assessment of the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions, which can be especially helpful in cases when conventional imaging findings are insufficient to establish a diagnosis. We discuss how to handle the diagnosis of radiologically isolated presentations of multiple sclerosis, which are included in the 2024 criteria. We present recommendations for image interpretation and avoidance of misdiagnosis, and extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older people, children, people with vascular comorbidities or migraine, and people living outside Europe and North America. Finally, we provide recommendations for standardisation of MRI acquisition and communication of results to enable an earlier diagnosis while maintaining high diagnostic specificity.

### MRI: role in optimising treatment [^114pMKCT]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an extremely sensitive diagnostic tool that provides us with highly detailed images of the living human brain. Since it was first applied to multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinical trials in the 1980s, MRI has become established as a reliable, sensitive and reproducible technique for studying the pathophysiology of this complex disease. It has provided a variety of surrogate measures for clinical trials, and continues to offer new methods for the detection and monitoring of the physical and chemical changes in the brains of living patients. The unique sensitivity of conventional MRI measures for detecting MS pathology has made MRI an attractive tool for optimising treatment in clinical practice for individual patients.

### MR imaging in multiple sclerosis: review and recommendations for current practice [^1168Qgm4]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

MR imaging is widely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with MS. Applications and protocols for MR imaging continue to evolve, prompting a need for continual reassessments of the optimal use of this technique in clinical practice. This article provides updated recommendations on the use of MR imaging in MS, based on a review of the trial evidence and personal experiences shared at a recent expert meeting of radiologists and neurologists.

### Evidence-based guidelines: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in multiple sclerosis-clinical implementation in the diagnostic process [^114rMRFs]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The clinical use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has advanced markedly over the past few years. Technical improvements and continuously emerging data from clinical trials and observational studies have contributed to the enhanced performance of this tool for achieving a prompt diagnosis in patients with MS. The aim of this article is to provide guidelines for the implementation of MRI of the brain and spinal cord in the diagnosis of patients who are suspected of having MS. These guidelines are based on an extensive review of the recent literature, as well as on the personal experience of the members of the MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS) network. We address the indications, timing, coverage, reporting and interpretation of MRI studies in patients with suspected MS. Our recommendations are intended to help radiologists and neurologists standardize and optimize the use of MRI in clinical practice for the diagnosis of MS.

### MRI differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis [^111iH4Tu]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) can be very challenging owing to its variable clinical features and lack of a definitive test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a core diagnostic tool in the detection of MS lesions and demonstration of spatial and temporal distribution of disease. Moreover, MRI plays a crucial role in the exclusion of alternative diagnoses of MS. The aim of this review is to describe the typical MRI features of MS and to present a series of common mimics of MS with emphasis on their distinguishing features from MS.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis-many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort, organised by The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008, provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings (so-called red flags) suggestive of alternative diagnoses. Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, CNS inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings; studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted. Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### Multiple sclerosis imaging: recent advances [^117Abkn8]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

In this review, we summarize advances in knowledge derived from the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) published in the Journal of Neurology over the past year. We highlight the pivotal role played by conventional MRI techniques for a correct and early diagnosis of this condition and the exclusion of alternative disorders. Advanced MR methods have contributed to demonstrating how damage to selected brain structures is related to disease clinical manifestations, thus contributing to overcome the well-known "clinical-radiological" paradox of MS, and ameliorating the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of irreversible disability. Finally, we discuss the use of MRI to assess treatment efficacy and optimize therapeutic approaches in this condition.

### Honing in on magnetic resonance imaging predictors of multiple sclerosis pathology [^117Akoth]. Brain Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

As our understanding of the mechanisms leading to tissue damage and repair in multiple sclerosis (MS) evolves, so does our desire to detect and monitor their structural and functional correlates in people with this chronic disease during life. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tissue injury in MS, in terms of severity and timing, this is of significant interest for (i) the management of people with MS (pwMS) in clinical practice and (ii) the selection of outcomes in clinical trials.

However, very few biopsies are being undertaken to confirm a tissue diagnosis of MS or to assess specific lesion stages, and despite significant progress in the field of fluid biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) retains its pivotal role translating histological findings into MRI signals that can be measured repeatedly, over a virtually infinite number of time points.

### 2021 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis [^114iDRcn]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The 2015 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis and 2016 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres guidelines on the use of MRI in diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis made an important step towards appropriate use of MRI in routine clinical practice. Since their promulgation, there have been substantial relevant advances in knowledge, including the 2017 revisions of the McDonald diagnostic criteria, renewed safety concerns regarding intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents, and the value of spinal cord MRI for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes. These developments suggest a changing role of MRI for the management of patients with multiple sclerosis. This 2021 revision of the previous guidelines on MRI use for patients with multiple sclerosis merges recommendations from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis study group, Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres, and North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis Cooperative, and translates research findings into clinical practice to improve the use of MRI for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of individuals with multiple sclerosis. We recommend changes in MRI acquisition protocols, such as emphasising the value of three dimensional-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery as the core brain pulse sequence to improve diagnostic accuracy and ability to identify new lesions to monitor treatment effectiveness, and we provide recommendations for the judicious use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for specific clinical purposes. Additionally, we extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis in childhood, during pregnancy, and in the post-partum period. Finally, we discuss promising MRI approaches that might deserve introduction into clinical practice in the near future.

### Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the international panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^113LtoZe]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The International Panel on MS Diagnosis presents revised diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). The focus remains on the objective demonstration of dissemination of lesions in both time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is integrated with dinical and other paraclinical diagnostic methods. The revised criteria facilitate the diagnosis of MS in patients with a variety of presentations, including "monosymptomatic" disease suggestive of MS, disease with a typical relapsing-remitting course, and disease with insidious progression, without clear attacks and remissions. Previously used terms such as "clinically definite" and "probable MS" are no longer recommended. The outcome of a diagnostic evaluation is either MS, "possible MS" (for those at risk for MS, but for whom diagnostic evaluation is equivocal), or "not MS".

### Neuroimaging in multiple sclerosis: neurotherapeutic implications [^112KBZg9]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging techniques, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play an important role in the diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) and related demyelinating diseases. Findings on MRI studies of the brain and spinal cord are critical for MS diagnosis, are used to monitor treatment response and may aid in predicting disease progression in individual patients. In addition, results of imaging studies serve as essential biomarkers in clinical trials of putative MS therapies and have led to important insights into disease pathophysiology. Although they are useful tools and provide in vivo measures of disease-related activity, there are some important limitations of MRI findings in MS, including the non-specific nature of detectable white matter changes, the poor correlation with clinical disability, the limited sensitivity and ability of standard measures of gadolinium enhancing lesions and T2 lesions to predict future clinical course, and the lack of validated biomarkers of long term outcomes. Advancements that hold promise for the future include new techniques that are sensitive to diffuse changes, the increased use of higher field scanners, measures that capture disease related changes in gray matter, and the use of combined structural and functional imaging approaches to assess the complex and evolving disease process that occurs during the course of MS.

### The use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and long-term management of multiple sclerosis [^114vBBDY]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to evolve, providing almost boundless information about tissue structure and function that can be obtained noninvasively in vivo. MRI is a key tool in the diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The technique is highly sensitive for the definition of brain and spinal cord involvement in MS, including the ability to detect multifocal lesions, diffuse (occult) disease, and macroscopic atrophy. Conventional MRI techniques, which include T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced imaging, are used primarily to detect overt lesions but can also be used to quantify tissue atrophy. Variations of these techniques also are important, and refinements are under way. The ability to demonstrate lesion dissemination in space and time has led to the common use of MRI as a paraclinical measure to support a diagnosis of MS, including in patients with clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes. In addition, MRI is used to monitor the progress of disease in patients with clinically definite MS, including assessment of lesions and atrophy. The use of conventional MRI in the diagnosis and longitudinal management of patients with MS is the focus of this review.

### Spinal cord MRI in multiple sclerosis – diagnostic, prognostic and clinical value [^112Qphxr]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS that affects both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI studies in MS focus more often on the brain than on the spinal cord, owing to the technical challenges in imaging this smaller, mobile structure. However, spinal cord abnormalities at disease onset have important implications for diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, later in the disease course, in progressive MS, myelopathy becomes the primary characteristic of the clinical presentation, and extensive spinal cord pathology — including atrophy, diffuse abnormalities and numerous focal lesions — is common. Recent spinal cord imaging studies have employed increasingly sophisticated techniques to improve detection and quantification of spinal cord lesions, and to elucidate their relationship with physical disability. Quantitative MRI measures of cord size and tissue integrity could be more sensitive to the axonal loss and other pathological processes in the spinal cord than is conventional MRI, putting quantitative MRI in a key role to elucidate the association between disability and spinal cord abnormalities seen in people with MS. In this Review, we summarize the most recent MS spinal cord imaging studies and discuss the new insights they have provided into the mechanisms of neurological impairment. Finally, we suggest directions for further and future research.

### A practical review of the neuropathology and neuroimaging of multiple sclerosis [^112CSM3y]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The variability in the severity and clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) has as its basis an extreme heterogeneity in the location, nature and extent of pathology in the brain and spinal cord. Understanding the underlying neuropathology and associated pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease helps to communicate the rationale for treatment and disease monitoring to patients. Neuroimaging is an important tool for this: it allows clinicians to relate neuropathological changes to clinical presentations and to monitor the course of their disease. Here, we review MS neuropathology and its imaging correlates to provide a practical guide for using MRI to assess disease severity and treatment responses. This provides a foundation for optimal management of patients based on the principle that they show 'no evidence of disease activity'.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^117NG175]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

In patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome, MRI can support and substitute clinical information in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by showing disease dissemination in space and time and by helping to exclude disorders that can mimic multiple sclerosis. MRI criteria were first included in the diagnostic work-up for multiple sclerosis in 2001, and since then several modifications to the criteria have been proposed in an attempt to simplify lesion-count models for showing disease dissemination in space, change the timing of MRI scanning to show dissemination in time, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging. Since the last update of these criteria, new data on the use of MRI to establish dissemination in space and time have become available, and MRI technology has improved. State-of-the-art MRI findings in these patients were discussed in a MAGNIMS workshop, the goal of which was to provide an evidence-based and expert-opinion consensus on proposed modifications to MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

### Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: progress and challenges [^115yeq7M]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on neurological symptoms and signs, alongside evidence of dissemination of CNS lesions in space and time. MRI is often sufficient to confirm the diagnosis when characteristic lesions accompany a typical clinical syndrome, but in some patients, further supportive information is obtained from cerebrospinal fluid examination and neurophysiological testing. Differentiation is important from other diseases in which demyelination is a feature (eg, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and from non-demyelinating disorders such as chronic small vessel disease and other inflammatory, granulomatous, infective, metabolic, and genetic causes that can mimic multiple sclerosis. Advances in MRI and serological and genetic testing have greatly increased accuracy in distinguishing multiple sclerosis from these disorders, but misdiagnosis can occur. In this Series paper we explore the progress and challenges in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with reference to diagnostic criteria, important differential diagnoses, controversies and uncertainties, and future prospects.

### MRI and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: expanding the concept of "no better explanation" [^1131uXbu]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Although the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis relies on the demonstration of disease dissemination in space and time, the exclusion of other neurological disorders is also essential. The limited specificity of abnormalities disclosed by MRI may increase the likelihood of diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients affected by other disorders. The available criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis have not taken advantage of the potential of MRI to detect features "not suggestive" of multiple sclerosis. Recognition of such features in the work-up of patients suspected of having multiple sclerosis may reduce the likelihood of a false positive diagnosis of the disorder in some, while suggesting the correct alternative diagnosis in other patients. On the basis of this, a workshop of the European MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Network in Multiple Sclerosis) was held to define a series of MRI red flags in the setting of clinically suspected multiple sclerosis that is derived from evidence-based findings and educated guesses. The presence of such red flags should alert clinicians to reconsider the differential diagnosis more extensively. In this review we will report on the conclusions of this international consensus, which should represent a first step beyond the concept of "no better explanation", and inform future diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis.

### The current role of MRI in differentiating multiple sclerosis from its imaging mimics [^1156pwM2]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

MRI red flags proposed over a decade ago by the European Magnetic Resonance Network in MS (MAGNIMS) have guided clinicians in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the past 10 years have seen increased recognition that vascular disease can coexist and possibly interact with MS, improvements in the reliability of ways to differentiate MS from novel antibody-mediated CNS disorders (such as anti-aquaporin-4 antibody and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated diseases) and advances in MRI techniques. In this Review, MAGNIMS updates the imaging features that differentiate the most common mimics of MS, particularly age-related cerebrovascular disease and neuromyelitis optica, from MS itself. We also provide a pragmatic summary of the clinically useful MRI features that distinguish MS from its mimics and discuss the future of nonconventional techniques that have identified promising disease-specific features.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^111z1nSD]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to detect and monitor inflammatory lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diagnostic criteria, as well as disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), have more recently increased the demand for MRI scans to allow early diagnosis and monitoring of treatment safety and efficacy. This has increased the burden on equipment and healthcare professionals, requiring rationalisation of resources.

Published guidelines on the use of MRI in MS exist. While these guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations, they do not translate easily into different clinical settings and considerable variation in practice remains. Indeed, wide variations exist in the MRI acquisition protocols and timing of scanning, as well as in the reporting of images. This makes within-patient, as well as between-centre comparisons difficult, delaying diagnosis and affecting treatment decisions. This variability underlines the need for further direction on the implementation of published guidelines to harmonise practice through the development of standardised MRI protocols and reports in MS that are informative, yet feasible and adaptable to a range of clinical settings within the National Health Service (NHS).

Here we report the outcome of a workshop that brought together MS specialists geographically representing the UK NHS and with expertise in MRI and that identified clinically informative MRI protocols applicable in a variety of clinical settings, from district general hospitals to tertiary centres.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^111yQb8J]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Closing remarks

Reading of MRI scans should be done in the appropriate clinical context. The premise of these guidelines and criteria is that we assume a basic knowledge of what constitutes a lesion. The largest linear measurement for lesion definition should be ≥ 3 mm in at least one plane. Therefore, lesion identification should be done by trained, expert personnel. Image quality must be of a high standard. A conservative approach in identifying lesions should be adopted.

In the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspicion of MS, the use of post-contrast sequences provides important information for the differential diagnosis. However, it should be noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made a safety communication for the long-term effects of repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), following the description of deposition of gadolinium in the brains of some patients who underwent multiple contrast-enhanced MRI scans. At the time of this writing, the impact of these safety concerns remains unknown.

MRI remains a valuable tool in identification of children and adults with MS, both at the time of an incident attack and when applied serially to confirm the chronic nature of this disease. More advanced imaging techniques inform on regional CNS involvement with greater sensitivity and may add to diagnostic specificity. Whether MRI features consistent with MS in the absence of clinical involvement can confirm MS diagnosis remains an area of controversy that requires further study and deliberation, particularly given evidence that some such individuals demonstrate focal and global loss of tissue integrity yet are not currently eligible for MS-directed therapies. As higher field-strength imaging and newer sequences better approximate pathology-level interrogation of the CNS, the fundamental question of what defines a disease like MS will need to be answered.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING

The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis and Therapeutic Monitoring

As evident from pathology studies, MS is a central nervous system (CNS)–wide disease with a chronic course. These hallmarks are reflected in the diagnostic criteria of MS. The McDonald criteria were originally introduced in 2001and underwent several revisions, most recently in 2017. These criteria identify MS or a high likelihood of the disease in patients with typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, monophasic clinical episodes with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings reflecting an inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS. Diagnosis requires the fulfillment of 2 criteria: (1) dissemination in time: at least 2 distinct episodes suggestive of MS in the patient history; and (2) dissemination in space: neuroinflammatory damage in different CNS regions.

Because there is no single pathognomonic clinical feature or diagnostic test for MS, the McDonald criteria integrate clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. However, MRI has gained particular momentum in the MS diagnosisand to rule out common MS mimics. With this, brain and spinal cord MRI remain the most important paraclinical tests to substantiate MS diagnosis, not least due to its ability to sensitively visualize white matter pathology.

Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to determine both dissemination in time and space. Dissemination in time can be confirmed by the simultaneous presence of non–gadolinium-enhancing and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the CNS or by a new T2-weighted (T2w) hyperintense or T1w contrast-enhancing lesion on a follow-up MRI scan. Dissemination in space can be confirmed by 1 or more T2w hyperintense lesions in 2 or more of 4 characteristic CNS sites, that is, (juxta)cortical, periventricular, infratentorial, and/or spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging can also support the identification of mechanisms behind disease progression, including paramagnetic rim lesions, subpial demyelination, distinct spinal cord pathology, and brain and spinal cord atrophy.

### Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2005 revisions to the "McDonald criteria" [^112Hum4q]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

New diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis integrating magnetic resonance image assessment with clinical and other paraclinical methods were introduced in 2001. The "McDonald Criteria" have been extensively assessed and used since 2001. New evidence and consensus now strengthen the role of these criteria in the multiple sclerosis diagnostic workup to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in time, to clarify the use of spinal cord lesions, and to simplify diagnosis of primary progressive disease. The 2005 Revisions to the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS should simplify and speed diagnosis, whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity and specificity.

### Classification, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^113CZ3o1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The increasing availability of effective therapies for multiple sclerosis as well as research demonstrating the benefits of early treatment highlights the importance of expedient and accurate multiple sclerosis diagnosis. This review will discuss the classification, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Recent Findings

An international panel of multiple sclerosis experts, the MS Phenotype Group, recently revised the multiple sclerosis phenotypic classifications and published their recommendations in 2014. Recent research developments have helped improve the accuracy of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, especially with regard to differentiating multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.

Summary

Current multiple sclerosis phenotypic classifications include relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, clinically isolated syndrome, radiologically isolated syndrome, primary-progressive multiple sclerosis, and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis. The McDonald 2010 diagnostic criteria provide formal guidelines for the diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and primary-progressive multiple sclerosis. These require demonstration of dissemination in space and time, with consideration given to both clinical findings and imaging data. The criteria also require that there exist no better explanation for the patient's presentation. The clinical history, examination, and MRI should be most consistent with multiple sclerosis, including the presence of features typical for the disease as well as the absence of features that suggest an alternative cause, for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis to be proposed.

### The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^112W6FtF]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis and as such requires the integration of historical information with neurological examination and relevant laboratory and paraclinical tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging. A recent revision of the diagnostic guidelines for multiple sclerosis has been published that formalizes the use of magnetic resonance imaging information along with the clinical picture. These new guidelines should provide for the earlier and easier diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, useful for both clinical trials and neurological practice.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: current status and future prospects [^117C65aF]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Many promising MRI approaches for research or clinical management of multiple sclerosis (MS) have recently emerged, or are under development or refinement. Advanced MRI methods need to be assessed to determine whether they allow earlier diagnosis or better identification of phenotypes. Improved post-processing should allow more efficient and complete extraction of information from images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy should improve in sensitivity and specificity with higher field strengths and should enable the detection of a wider array of metabolites. Diffusion imaging is moving closer to the goal of defining structural connectivity and, thereby, determining the functional significance of lesions at specific locations. Cell-specific imaging now seems feasible with new magnetic resonance contrast agents. The imaging of myelin water fraction brings the hope of providing a specific measure of myelin content. Ultra-high-field MRI increases sensitivity, but also presents new technical challenges. Here, we review these recent developments in MRI for MS, and also look forward to refinements in spinal-cord imaging, optic-nerve imaging, perfusion MRI, and functional MRI. Advances in MRI should improve our ability to diagnose, monitor, and understand the pathophysiology of MS.

Conclusions

In this report, we address the need for a standardisation of practice in the use of MRI for MS across clinical settings within the NHS. We suggest MRI scanning protocols and templates for MRI requests and post-scan reports in the attempt to facilitate diagnosis and optimise management of patients with MS, while considering the heterogeneity of resources and expertise that different clinical settings may present. The role of optic nerve imaging in MS was not discussed, as this is not currently included in the imaging diagnostic criteria for MS and, in MS monitoring, its informativeness is established by the clinician in each individual case.

Our proposed protocol aims to strike a balance between the need for frequent and accurate radiological information and the availability of equipment and staffing resources. The timing of MRI scans aims to capture, as early as possible, MS or its evolution that can be amenable to the starting or the changing of DMTs. The MRI acquisition protocol proposes a minimum, standardised set of meaningful information that can be used to manage MS. Indeed, published international guidelines offer guidance on MRI features that are most relevant to the diagnosis of MS. Their implementation in clinical practice, however, has proven to be challenging across clinical settings, especially when the care of MS patients is outside specialist centres. Our proposed application of MRI for MS in clinical practice balances the specialist requirements with practical limitations imposed by limited resources by streamlining acquisition protocols and by standardising the timing of scans to integrate MRI findings in the clinical decision-making process. This effort can aid the impetus towards standardisation of practice and offer an example of research-informed service improvement to support optimisation of resources.

The authors also tackled the issue of effective communication between specialists, i.e. clinicians and radiologists, that is paramount in a multi-disciplinary context. We tailored our suggestions regarding the format of requests and reports for MRI scanning so that they can be used as a standardised, time-sparing tool for obtaining clinically relevant MRI information about MS patients. Indeed, the authors felt that clear, minimal information about the reason for the MRI scan was essential for the radiologist to correctly address the clinician's question. Similarly, quantitative information about the MRI scan was felt to be necessary to manage MS effectively and promptly by clinicians. This quantitative, rather than merely descriptive, approach to MRI scan reporting for diagnostic, as well as for MRI monitoring scans, can contribute to an improved integration of MRI information in the clinical management of patients.

### MR in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis: an overview [^112Kh7ZP]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, persistent inflammatory-demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that typically presents as an acute clinically isolated syndrome attributable to a monofocal or multifocal demyelinating lesion, which usually affects the optic nerve, spinal cord, or brainstem and cerebellum. Although the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is still based on clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging is now integrated in the overall diagnostic scheme of the disease because of its unique sensitivity to demonstrate the spatial and temporal dissemination of demyelinating plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, such as T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences are highly sensitive in detecting multiple sclerosis plaques and provide a quantitative assessment of inflammatory activity and lesion load. However, there is a persisting mismatch between clinical and magnetic resonance imaging efficacy of approved treatments, which underlies the fact that this technique does not suffice to explain the entire spectrum of the disease process. In recent years, great effort has been dedicated to overcoming these limitations by using non-conventional magnetic resonance-derived metrics that can selectively measure the more destructive aspects of multiple sclerosis pathology and monitor the reparative mechanisms. These metrics, which include unenhanced T1-weighted imaging, measures of central nervous system atrophy, magnetization transfer imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, provide a better approximation of the pathological substrate of the multiple sclerosis plaques, have increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and have proven useful for studying the natural history of multiple sclerosis and monitoring the effects of new treatments. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging not only plays an essential role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, but can also serve as a true biological marker of the severity of this disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, AAN 2018 guidelines recommend to monitor MRI disease activity from the clinical onset of the disease to detect the accumulation of new lesions in order to inform treatment decisions in patients with MS on disease-modifying therapies.

### Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria [^113YdWxD]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are widely used in research and clinical practice. Scientific advances in the past 7 years suggest that they might no longer provide the most up-to-date guidance for clinicians and researchers. The International Panel on Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis reviewed the 2010 McDonald criteria and recommended revisions. The 2017 McDonald criteria continue to apply primarily to patients experiencing a typical clinically isolated syndrome, define what is needed to fulfil dissemination in time and space of lesions in the CNS, and stress the need for no better explanation for the presentation. The following changes were made: in patients with a typical clinically isolated syndrome and clinical or MRI demonstration of dissemination in space, the presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands allows a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; symptomatic lesions can be used to demonstrate dissemination in space or time in patients with supratentorial, infratentorial, or spinal cord syndrome; and cortical lesions can be used to demonstrate dissemination in space. Research to further refine the criteria should focus on optic nerve involvement, validation in diverse populations, and incorporation of advanced imaging, neurophysiological, and body fluid markers.

### Early MRI predictors of prognosis in multiple sclerosis [^115Db63N]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although some simple informative early clinical markers of disease course are available, individual prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains unreliable and leads to difficulties both in counseling and treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Decisions to initiate immunomodulatory treatment often depend on recent inflammatory disease activity, whereas accurate personalised long-term prognosis, which might inform both the timing and type of treatment, remains elusive. This month's journal club reviews three studies that examine the predictive value of early MRI features in determining selective long-term outcomes such as future physical and cognitive disability and transition to secondary progressive disease phase. The use of brain imaging to visualise both cortical and chronically active 'smouldering' white matter lesions, may reduce the clinical-radiological paradox that has previously been described in MS. The studies outlined below explore some conventional and more novel MRI markers at baseline for their ability to predict subsequent disease progression and prognosis.

### Diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis from the imaging perspective: a review [^114Mtxf7]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for monitoring disease dissemination in space and over time and excluding multiple sclerosis (MS) mimics, there has been less application of MRI to progressive MS, including diagnosing primary progressive (PP) MS and identifying patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS who are at risk of developing secondary progressive (SP) MS. This review addresses clinical application of MRI for both diagnosis and prognosis of progressive MS.

Observations

Although nonspecific, some spinal cord imaging features (diffuse abnormalities and lesions involving gray matter [GM] and ≥ 2 white matter columns) are typical of PPMS. In patients with PPMS and those with relapse-onset MS, location of lesions in critical central nervous system regions (spinal cord, infratentorial regions, and GM) and MRI-detected high inflammatory activity in the first years after diagnosis are risk factors for long-term disability and future progressive disease course. These measures are evaluable in clinical practice. In patients with established MS, GM involvement and neurodegeneration are associated with accelerated clinical worsening. Subpial demyelination and slowly expanding lesions are novel indicators of progressive MS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis of PPMS is more challenging than diagnosis of RRMS. No qualitative clinical, immunological, histopathological, or neuroimaging features differentiate PPMS and SPMS; both are characterized by imaging findings reflecting neurodegeneration and are also impacted by aging and comorbidities. Unmet diagnostic needs include identification of MRI markers capable of distinguishing PPMS from RRMS and predicting the evolution of RRMS to SPMS. Integration of multiple parameters will likely be essential to achieve these aims.

### New prospects for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis [^112P2bqU]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides its critical role in MS diagnosis, MRI also has a key role in therapeutic monitoring of MS upon initiation of disease-modifying therapy. The most commonly used treatment response measure is new or enlarging lesions on T2w MRI scans. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are another frequently used surrogate marker for clinical activity, but accumulation of new T2w lesions more sensitively gauges subclinical disease activity, especially when assessed using image subtraction. Finally, it is undisputed that brain and spinal cord atrophy can aid in monitoring disease activity, yet quantifying atrophy in the clinical setting is still at risk of substantial confounding factors caused by physiological (eg, diurnal brain size fluctuation, hydration state) or technical parameters (eg, acquisition protocols, gradient distortion, or intrascanner/interscanner variability) (reviewed in Sastre-Garriga et al).

Limitations of Multiple Sclerosis Magnetic Resonance Imaging at Clinical Field Strengths

Early MS treatment is associated with better long-term outcomes, making early diagnosis key for effective patient management. Yet the pressure to diagnose MS early frequently results in misdiagnosis, which can have serious health and financial consequences. Given this, it is noteworthy that the McDonald criteria do not address differentiating MS from other disorders. Instead, the focus of the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria optimizes sensitivity over specificity. In fact, several studies have found suboptimal specificity of the current McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis; these include a retrospective Chinese study including 93 CIS patients, which detected 75% sensitivity but only 47% specificity upon usage of the 2017 McDonald criteria, and a prospective Indian study comprising 82 CIS patients, which showed a specificity of 79%.

### MRI in the diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis [^115MoVyB]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

MRI techniques, including conventional T(2)-weighted and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T(1)-weighted images, have provided important insights into the pathophysiology of MS. Although the correlation of MRI measures with clinical disability and outcome continues to be investigated, MRI measures are routinely used both in clinical practice and in MS research. In addition to its use as a diagnostic tool, MRI is used as a surrogate marker to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. A variety of MRI measures are used in drug development studies and have aided our understanding of the potential benefits and possible mechanisms of action of drug therapies. Advances in MRI techniques may further elucidate the pathology of MS, thus providing opportunities for new treatment strategies.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^111DSNqk]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was formally included in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001 by an International Panel of experts.MS diagnosis requires demonstration of disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and exclusion of other conditions that can mimic MS by their clinical and laboratory profile. MRI can support and substitute clinical information for MS diagnosis, allowing an earlier and accurate diagnosis and, consequently, earlier treatment.

MRI criteria for MS are based on the presence of focal lesions in the white matter (WM) of the central nervous system (CNS), which are considered typical for this condition in terms of distribution, morphology, evolution, and signal abnormalities on conventional MRI sequences (e.g. T2-weighted, T2-FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted scans). – Several modifications of MRI diagnostic criteria have been proposed over the years. These revisions have simplified the lesion-count models for demonstrating DIS, changed the timing of MRI scanning for demonstrating DIT, and increased the value of spinal cord imaging. – In 2007, the European collaborative research network that studies MRI in MS (MAGNIMS) reviewed the findings of studies that addressed these issues and proposed new MRI criteria to be applied in MS. Those MAGNIMS criteria are currently included in the most recent of the MS diagnostic criteria, known as the 2010 McDonald criteria. Recent consensus guidelines for clinicians regarding optimization of the planning, performance, and interpretation of brain and spinal cord MRI in the MS diagnostic process have also been published and are complementary to the recommendations in this paper.

Since 2011, new data regarding the application of MRI for demonstrating DIS and DIT have become available, and these deserve consideration for future revisions of the MS criteria. Additionally, many improvements in MRI technology have occurred, which resulted in the development of innovative acquisition sequences, the identification of novel pathophysiological mechanisms that may help in the differential diagnosis, and new insights into MS disease activity as evidenced by high-field and ultra-high-field scanners. The MAGNIMS members felt the need for timely revision of these recent findings and consideration of how they should modify the MRI criteria for the diagnosis of MS. A summary of the main revisions or clarifications to the MRI component of the 2010 McDonald criteria for MS we propose is presented in the stand alone panel.

### Ultra-high-field MR imaging in multiple sclerosis [^111ABKHZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), MRI is the most important paraclinical tool used to inform diagnosis and for monitoring disease evolution, either natural or modified by treatment. The increased availability of ultra-high-field magnets (7 Tesla or higher) gives rise to questions about the main benefits of and challenges for their use in patients with MS. The main advantages of ultra-high-field MRI are the improved signal-to-noise ratio, greater chemical shift dispersion, and improved contrast due to magnetic susceptibility variations, which lead to increased sensitivity to the heterogeneous pathological substrates of the disease. At present, ultra-high-field MRI is mainly used to improve our understanding of MS pathogenesis. This review discusses the main achievements that have so far come from the use of these scanners, which are: better visualisation of white matter lesions and their morphological characteristics; an improvement in the ability to visualise grey matter lesions and their exact location; the quantification of 'novel' metabolites which may have a role in axonal degeneration; and greater sensitivity to iron accumulation. The application of ultra-high-field systems in standard clinical practice is still some way off since their role in the diagnostic work-up of patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes, or in monitoring disease progression or treatment response in patients with definite MS, needs to be established. Additional challenges remain in the development of morphological, quantitative and functional imaging methods at these field strengths, techniques which may ultimately lead to novel biomarkers for monitoring disease evolution and treatment response.

### Outcome measures assisting treatment optimization in multiple sclerosis [^113TEaEi]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Since the introduction of the EDSS in 1983, numerous tests and instruments have been developed for the assessment of patient function and progression of MS. These instruments have enhanced the ability of the clinician to identify changes in pwMS that otherwise might be missed in a purely clinical assessment. Early identification of patient conditions that require symptomatic interventions or optimization of disease-modifying therapies may result in better outcomes. Moreover, these instruments are objective measurements of the disease evolution. Rather than evaluate and comment on all available instruments, we have focused on those that are most useful in clinical practice based on ease of administration, objective quantitative results, and applicability in clinical practice.

As complexity and heterogeneity are hallmarks of MS, the diagnosis and management of the disease require a combination of clinical scales, imaging techniques and laboratory findings to monitor and quantify symptomatic complications as well as underlying pathological events. Each technique has advantages and deficiencies and none is an ideal outcome measure; thus, a combinatory approach of both clinical rating scales and imaging techniques can help to provide a more holistic picture of disease progression. Rating scales targeted at specific variables (e.g. motor strength, spasticity, walking ability) can provide information about the symptomatic impact of the disease to the individual patient while MRI is able to provide information about the underlying pathology as well as essential prognostic detail. For diagnostic purposes, MRI evidence plays a supportive role in what is ultimately a clinical diagnosis of MS, since MRI abnormalities can be associated with other diseases and non-specific MRI lesions are also common in the general population. CSF analysis of oligoclonal bands, visual evoked potentials, and OCT can all be used to support diagnosis in patients with typical presentation who have insufficient clinical and MRI evidence to confirm the diagnosis.

### Imaging as an outcome measure in multiple sclerosis [^113fwxSx]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to lesion formation both in the brain and spinal cord. Imaging plays a prominent role in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. Over a dozen anti-inflammatory therapies are approved for MS and the development of many of these medications was made possible through the use of contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI as a phase II outcome. A similar phase II outcome method for the neurodegeneration that underlies progressive courses of the disease is still unavailable. Although magnetic resonance is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment effects in MS, several imaging barriers still exist. In general, MRI is less sensitive to gray matter lesions, lacks pathological specificity, and does not provide quantitative data easily. Several advanced imaging methods including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer, functional MRI, myelin water fraction imaging, ultra-high field MRI, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography of the retina study promising ways of overcoming the difficulties in MS imaging.

### The role of advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in multiple sclerosis clinical trials [^112Adxhf]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging has been crucial in the development of anti-inflammatory disease-modifying treatments. The current landscape of multiple sclerosis clinical trials is currently expanding to include testing not only of anti-inflammatory agents, but also neuroprotective, remyelinating, neuromodulating, and restorative therapies. This is especially true of therapies targeting progressive forms of the disease where neurodegeneration is a prominent feature. Imaging techniques of the brain and spinal cord have rapidly evolved in the last decade to permit in vivo characterization of tissue microstructural changes, connectivity, metabolic changes, neuronal loss, glial activity, and demyelination. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques hold significant promise for accelerating the development of different treatment modalities targeting a variety of pathways in MS.

### Continuous evolution of magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis [^113xFKnR]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of MR imaging into routine clinical practice in the 1990s, it has become firmly embedded into the diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis (MS). Furthermore, serial MR brain imaging is increasingly being used to complement contemporary clinical assessment of MS disease activity. Clinical imaging in MS largely relies upon the detection of T2-hyperintense and T1-gadolinium enhancing lesions, as surrogate markers of foci of inflammatory demyelination in the white matter. Beyond the scope of conventional clinical imaging, advanced MR technology is now capable of detecting and quantifying pathology in tissue compartments previously thought to be unaffected in MS. The appreciation of microscopic damage within the "normal-appearing white matter" and grey matter of the brain and spinal cord has considerably advanced our knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS.

In this month's journal club we describe three papers that relate to MR imaging in MS. This first paper describes the latest MR criteria for MS diagnosis. The second paper describes the imaging characteristics of the radiologically isolated syndrome and how they, along with clinical factors, relate to the subsequent onset of symptomatic demyelinating disease. The third paper uses advanced MR technology to uncover the regional pattern of cortical atrophy in MS and its relationship to white matter pathology and clinical disability.

### Present and future of the diagnostic work-up of multiple sclerosis: the imaging perspective [^115hKY9Q]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires a symptomatic demyelinating syndrome with objective neurologic findings, the demonstration of a pathological process disseminated in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and the exclusion of alternative conditions.

Recently, the enhanced characterization of clinical and radiologic features associated with different inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS and improvements in neuroimaging and laboratory technologies have contributed to the refinement of the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspicion of MS. Subsequent iterations of the McDonald criteria have defined evidence-based imaging features typical of MS, facilitating earlier fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for MS.

Since a specific MS biomarker is not available, simplifications and easier fulfilment of the diagnostic criteria (e.g. requiring fewer MRI lesions and substituting detection of intrathecal immunoglobulin G [IgG] synthesis for DIT) may increase the risk of MS misdiagnosis. These considerations have prompted extensive research in the field of neuroimaging to identify novel MRI features more specific to MS. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been recently suggested as a new promising tool for MS clinical practice.

An international meeting was held on the 3rd of November 2021, which involved neurologists and (neuro)radiologists with expertise in MS and its mimics (see Acknowledgments for details) to summarize the most recent applications of MRI in the MS diagnostic work-up but also possible future innovations. The key aspects discussed in the meeting included the current evidence regarding the clinical application of the 2017 McDonald criteria, promising novel markers to improve accuracy of diagnosis, and the potential contribution of AI for MS diagnostic work-up.

Experts provided a summary related to each topic (see Table 1 for search strategy and selection criteria). A group consensus was reached during the meeting and summarized in a first draft, which was circulated among the speakers and additional experts in the field for critical discussion and revision.

This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art and possible future applications of MRI technologies for the diagnostic work-up of MS.

Increasing attention is also given to the diagnosis and prognostication of subjects with brain MRI abnormalities suggestive of MS, but lacking historical accounts of prior demyelinating events (i.e. "radiologically isolated syndrome" [RIS] or "prodromic phase of MS"). This is out-of-scope of the present review and it is described elsewhere.

### MS, MRI, and the 2010 McDonald criteria: a Canadian expert commentary [^115YC7tq]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first development of diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), there have been regular revisions of disease definitions and diagnostic thresholds aimed at improving specificity while maintaining sensitivity. The central requirements for diagnosis of MS are dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT) of lesions in the CNS, with the proviso that there should be no alternate diagnosis that better explains the clinical presentation. The most definitive diagnosis is the purely clinical one, with 2 separate attacks of symptoms (fulfilling DIT criteria) involving at least 2 different areas of the CNS (fulfilling DIS criteria). In patients who have had a first but not a second clinical attack, the McDonald criteria provide guidance on how paraclinical evidence can be used to support a diagnosis of MS. Recently, the McDonald criteria were revised and new definitions for DIS and DIT proposed. In response to that revision, a panel of Canadian MS neurologists and one neuroradiologist created this commentary regarding the clinical implications and applications of the 2010 McDonald criteria.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^111FdZ6J]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Focal white matter lesions, which are hyperintense on T 2 -weighted scans, are among the pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis, and MRI is formally included in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis. Current MRI criteria for multiple sclerosis are based on imaging features that are characteristic of the disease, but are not sufficiently specific. Over time, revisions of the multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria have improved the sensitivity, particularly adding the capability to confirm the diagnosis at first clinical presentation.

However little attention has been given to describing the imaging features included in these criteria in detail, and guiding neurologists and neuroradiologists in correctly interpreting them. In patients with few lesions, there is a particularly increased risk of misdiagnosis based on MRI. We hope that the guidelines provided will minimize the risk of inappropriate image interpretation and increase the awareness of redflags.

As mentioned earlier, these criteria should only be used in the appropriate clinical context, when onset is characterized by clinical manifestations typical of multiple sclerosis.

Different scanners and field strengths, upgrades in equipment, and changes in acquisition parameters could influence lesion evaluations. However, although high-field MRI enables the detection of a higher number of white matter lesions in CIS and multiple sclerosis patients, field strength has been shown not to affect fulfilment of criteria for dissemination in space and time, also in a multicentre setting.

Accordingly, if MRI studies are performed on scanners with a minimum field strength of 1.5 T and the MRI protocols are standardized using appropriate sequences to obtain good quality images with adequate resolution, lesion assessment and longitudinal monitoring can be performed robustly and independently of these confounding factors.

In challenging situations (e.g. low numbers of lesions and with confounding comorbidities) both the specific characteristics of each individual lesion as well as the overall patterns of lesions (e.g. symmetric central lesion in the pons and deep white matter lesions in ischaemic small-vessel disease) should be taken into account to support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or other conditions.

Emerging data suggest that advanced MRI sequences can enhance our ability to distinguish key, previously established characteristics of multiple sclerosis (e.g. cortical or perivenular lesions) that will enhance diagnosis because they are highly specific.

Although we focused the discussion on the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria framework, the technical developments, combined with recent discoveries about the links between lesion characteristics and multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, will likely drive future improvements to — and perhaps even rethinking of — current criteria.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^115XhTSE]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

In patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can support and substitute clinical information for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis demonstrating disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and helping to rule out other conditions that can mimic MS. From their inclusion in the diagnostic work-up for MS in 2001, several modifications of MRI diagnostic criteria have been proposed, in the attempt to simplify lesion-count models for demonstrating DIS, change the timing of MRI scanning for demonstrating DIT, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging.

Since the last update of these criteria, new data regarding the application of MRI for demonstrating DIS and DIT have become available and improvement in MRI technology has occurred. State-of-the-art MRI findings in these patients were discussed in a MAGNIMS workshop, the goal of which was to provide an evidence-based and expert-opinion consensus on diagnostic MRI criteria modifications.

### Accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: systematic review [^111DbdBg]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging criteria for the early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients with suspected disease.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

12 electronic databases, citation searches, and reference lists of included studies. Review methods Studies on accuracy of diagnosis that compared magnetic resonance imaging, or diagnostic criteria incorporating such imaging, to a reference standard for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Results

29 studies (18 cohort studies, 11 other designs) were included. On average, studies of other designs (mainly diagnostic case-control studies) produced higher estimated diagnostic odds ratios than did cohort studies. Among 15 studies of higher methodological quality (cohort design, clinical follow-up as reference standard), those with longer follow-up produced higher estimates of specificity and lower estimates of sensitivity. Only two such studies followed patients for more than 10 years. Even in the presence of many lesions (> 10 or > 8), magnetic resonance imaging could not accurately rule multiple sclerosis in (likelihood ratio of a positive test result 3.0 and 2.0, respectively). Similarly, the absence of lesions was of limited utility in ruling out a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (likelihood ratio of a negative test result 0.1 and 0.5).

Conclusions

Many evaluations of the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for the early detection of multiple sclerosis have produced inflated estimates of test performance owing to methodological weaknesses. Use of magnetic resonance imaging to confirm multiple sclerosis on the basis of a single attack of neurological dysfunction may lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment.

### The ageing central nervous system in multiple sclerosis: the imaging perspective [^111tDKYL]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

An international meeting within the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) network was held on the 10 November 2023, which involved neurologists, immunologists, pathologists, physicists and (neuro)radiologists with expertise in multiple sclerosis and MRI (Supplementary material) to summarize the most recent knowledge on the immunopathological and neuroimaging aspects of ageing in the CNS in the context of multiple sclerosis. The key aspects discussed in the meeting included the most recent evidence regarding immunosenescence, ageing-related pathological mechanisms, and specific features like enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces and glymphatic system dysfunction. Clinical aspects, including late-onset multiple sclerosis, the influence of age on diagnostic criteria, and comorbidity effects on imaging features were also reviewed. Finally, the role of MRI in understanding neurodegeneration, iron dynamics and myelin changes influenced by ageing and how MRI can contribute to defining treatment effects in ageing multiple sclerosis patients were examined.

Experts provided a summary related to each topic (see Supplementary Table 1 for search strategy and selection criteria). A group consensus was reached during the meeting and summarized in a first draft, which was circulated among the speakers and additional experts in the field for critical discussion and revision.

### MAGNIMS consensus recommendations on the use of brain and spinal cord atrophy measures in clinical practice [^113uZgKd]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory component of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology can be focal or diffuse and is associated with neurodegenerative processes that ultimately lead to irreversible tissue damage and neuronal loss. Neurodegeneration was originally thought to be a late-stage phenomenon with limited clinical relevance, but it is now recognized as being associated with acute inflammation from the early stages of MS and as the main driver of irreversible disability –. In parallel with improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of neurodegeneration, advances in imaging techniques have enabled in vivo assessment of brain and spinal cord area and volumes using MRI. Although brain and spinal cord volume loss observed with MRI cannot be equated with atrophy, because the latter implies pathologically proven and irreversible tissue loss, changes in these MRI measures are associated with atrophyand the level of disability in MS.

MRI-based quantification of inflammatory activity in MS — on the basis of lesion counts and lesion volumes — is established as the main efficacy outcome in phase II clinical trials. Currently, brain and spinal cord volume measures have no role in the MS diagnostic criteria, or disease course classification, but a body of evidence that these measures are valuable for early evaluation of treatment responses and prediction of disease evolution has been steadily growing alongside improvements in methodology that could facilitate widespread implementation of these measures in clinical practice. A key difficulty arises in this implementation because translation of group-based results into actionable, patient-level information must be made with extreme caution.

In this Consensus Statement, we, on behalf of the, provide specific recommendations for the implementation of brain and spinal cord atrophy measures in the clinical management of patients with MS and on the directions of future research to improve our knowledge in this field. The recommendations are based on a critical review of the literature and the personal experience of MAGNIMS study group members. We discuss the difficulties of translating group-based data into clinical application and highlight where particular caution is appropriate. We first discuss the role of atrophy measures on prognosis, then treatment monitoring and, finally, the barriers to implementation in clinical practice. Each of these three sections comprises a review of the available evidence and a set of consensus guidelines.

### Pharmacovigilance during treatment of multiple sclerosis: early recognition of CNS complications [^1178DMyV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of highly effective disease-modifying therapies for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have recently gained marketing approval. While the beneficial effects of these drugs in terms of clinical and imaging outcome measures is welcomed, these therapeutics are associated with substance-specific or group-specific adverse events that include severe and fatal complications. These adverse events comprise both infectious and non-infectious complications that can occur within, or outside of the central nervous system (CNS). Awareness and risk assessment strategies thus require interdisciplinary management, and robust clinical and paraclinical surveillance strategies. In this review, we discuss the current role of MRI in safety monitoring during pharmacovigilance of patients treated with (selective) immune suppressive therapies for MS. MRI, particularly brain MRI, has a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of CNS complications that potentially are severely debilitating and may even be lethal. Early recognition of such CNS complications may improve functional outcome and survival, and thus knowledge on MRI features of treatment-associated complications is of paramount importance to MS clinicians, but also of relevance to general neurologists and radiologists.

Diagnosis

MRI has become a well-established tool for diagnostic purposes and facilitates the early diagnosis of MS; it is performed after clinical examination and history taking, facilitating early disease-modifying treatment. The McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS include specific MRI requirements for the demonstration of lesion dissemination in space and time.

The diagnostic utility of MRI is high, with sensitivity and specificity of up to 87 and 73 percent, respectively, for the McDonald criteria requirement of dissemination in space. MRI detects many more MS lesions than computed tomography (CT), and it is able to detect MS demyelinating plaques in regions that are rarely abnormal on CT. Most lesions visualized by MRI correlate with pathologic lesions.

### The role of non-conventional MR techniques to study multiple sclerosis patients [^112Z94UD]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lacks pathological specificity to the heterogeneous substrates of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and is not able to detect subtle, disease-related changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). As a consequence, the correlation between MRI findings and the long-term evolution of MS is moderate at best. To overcome the limitations of conventional MRI, new quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, such as cell-specific imaging, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and functional MR imaging (fMRI) have all been recently applied to the study of MS. These techniques should provide more accurate and pathologically specific estimates of the MS lesion burden than conventional MR and should improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to MS-related irreversible disability.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain a standardized reference brain MRI, usually within 6 months of treatment onset, and compare it with a further brain MRI obtained typically 12 months after starting treatment to monitor treatment response in patients treated with disease-modifying drugs. Adjust the timing of both MRI, taking into account the drug's mechanism of action (particularly the speed of action) and disease activity (including clinical and MRI measures).

Detection of disease activity and monitoring of efficacy

Monitoring MRI scans are useful in naïve patients, as well as at the beginning or following initiation or change of DMTs, or if a relapse is suspected, but cannot be confirmed purely on clinical grounds. Indeed, the importance of MRI to confirm stability is highlighted by the role of radiological activity in the evaluation of treatment response.

Spinal cord MRI can reveal asymptomatic disease activity, as well as predict disease evolution. Therefore, the authors felt that it should be performed regularly in addition to the brain scans, especially, but not exclusively, in patients in whom a previous involvement of the spinal cord has been demonstrated clinically or radiologically. Indeed, about 58% of new spinal cord lesions can be asymptomatic and 25% of patients with relapsing MS develops at least one asymptomatic spinal cord lesion over 1.5 years; when only patients with stable RRMS are considered, 10% of them show subclinical spinal cord lesion activity alone. Asymptomatic spinal cord lesions can also predict relapses, when combined with asymptomatic brain lesions. Therefore, as spinal cord MRI can disclose subclinical disease activity in otherwise clinically stable MS, the authors supported its routine use in patient's monitoring throughout the course of the disease and regardless of the clinical manifestation of MS in the cord.

Gd should be considered to aid detection of new inflammatory activity, when this would be too difficult to detect, due to high lesion burden, as well as for its prognostic utility, e.g. brain ring-enhancement patterns may forebode irreversible tissue damage and thus brain volume loss. In the post-partum period, when monitoring is particularly important because of higher risk of relapse, the use of contrast enhancement may be limited by breastfeeding.

When patients are on specific DMTs, the primary purpose of a follow-up MRI scan is the detection of new inflammatory activity and the exclusion of opportunistic infections for safety of DMT prescription. As DMTs may reach their peak level of activity on MRI months after their initiation, a re-baseline scan beyond this time point is advisable. The authors felt that whether this scan should be performed with or without contrast enhancement should depend on clinical considerations such as the level of inflammatory activity at DMT initiation, the type of medication started and the age of the patient that all together define a risk for active disease. The presence or persistence of a Gd-active MRI scan at re-baseline could predict subsequent clinical and MRI activity and thus could indicate a subgroup of patients at higher risk of activity during DMTs.

### Revised diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis [^114dXRqK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) of presumed autoimmune etiology, characterized by localized areas of inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss and gliosis in the brain and spinal cord. Although the clinical presentation and course of the disease are highly variable, several disease types can be recognized, including relapsing-remitting-(RR), primary-progressive-(PP), secondary-progressive-(SP), progressive-relapsing-(PR) MS and clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS). There is no single clinical feature or diagnostic test that is sufficient to diagnose MS, and the diagnosis is mainly a clinical one. Over the years, several sets of criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of MS, based on the principles of dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT) of CNS lesions, and the exclusion of other diseases with similar characteristics. With each revision, new diagnostic criteria modified disease definitions and diagnostic thresholds, while aiming at maintaining sensitivity and improving specificity. According to the older Schumacher and Poser criteria, MS can be diagnosed clinically by demonstrating 2 separate attacks (fulfilling DIT criteria) involving at least 2 different areas of the CNS (fulfilling DIS criteria). The 2001 McDonald criteria and their 2005 revision incorporated defined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria for DIS and DIT that provided guidance on how to diagnose MS after CIS. The most recent 2010 McDonald criteria simplify requirements for DIS and DIT and may allow for an earlier diagnosis of MS from a single baseline brain MRI if there are both silent gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. Despite these important advances in the diagnosis of MS, some questions still remain regarding the application and the implications of the new criteria in the daily clinical practice and in clinical trials. Most importantly, thorough clinical evaluation and judgment along with careful differential diagnosis still remain the basics in the diagnosis of MS.

### Predicting multiple sclerosis disease progression and outcomes with machine learning and MRI-based biomarkers: a review [^1121VC7p]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurological disorder with a highly heterogeneous clinical presentation and course of progression. Disease-modifying therapies are the only available treatment, as there is no known cure for the disease. Careful selection of suitable therapies is necessary, as they can be accompanied by serious risks and adverse effects such as infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of MS, though MRI lesions have displayed only moderate associations with MS clinical outcomes, known as the clinico-radiological paradox. With the advent of machine learning (ML) in healthcare, the predictive power of MRI can be improved by leveraging both traditional and advanced ML algorithms capable of analyzing increasingly complex patterns within neuroimaging data. The purpose of this review was to examine the application of MRI-based ML for prediction of MS disease progression. Studies were divided into five main categories: predicting the conversion of clinically isolated syndrome to MS, cognitive outcome, EDSS-related disability, motor disability and disease activity. The performance of ML models is discussed along with highlighting the influential MRI-derived biomarkers. Overall, MRI-based ML presents a promising avenue for MS prognosis. However, integration of imaging biomarkers with other multimodal patient data shows great potential for advancing personalized healthcare approaches in MS.

### 7 tesla MRI in multiple sclerosis: insights from its use in clinical routine [^116LqTvb]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its capabilities, clinical implementation of 7 T MRI has been limited. Although FDA approval of a commercial 7 T scanner in 2017 permitted its use in clinical practice, access remains restricted due to high investment and maintenance costs, as well as availability and specific safety considerations. To date, in MS, 7 T MRI has not been widely integrated into routine diagnostic workflows, and its impact on clinical management remains uncertain, despite more accurate detection of MS‐related pathologies. Nonetheless, its role as a valuable clinical tool for MS is increasing. Recently, the North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative published a statement on the future use of 7 T MRI in MS, but focused primarily on the use of 7 T MRI in MS research. A recent publication tried to address the use of 7 T MRI in clinical routine from single‐center experience, but focused primarily on a technical perspective, including detailed protocols and sequence parameters.

In MS and related disorders, two prominent settings for the clinical use of 7 T MRI are (i) initial diagnostic workup in unclear, diagnostically challenging cases when MS is suspected and (ii) aspects suggestive of differential diagnoses in patients with diagnosed MS, like relevant comorbidities, unclear progression despite adequate immunotherapy/rehabilitative treatments, and clinical/imaging ambiguities despite adequate diagnostic workup with conventional 1.5 or 3 T MRI.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^111Rtkf8]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since their introduction in 2001 up to the recent 2017 revision, the McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis are based on the number, size and location of brain and spinal cord lesions believed to be typical of multiple sclerosis. Lesion assessment on conventional T 2 -weighted and post-contrast T 1 -weighted MRI sequences has allowed the definition of criteria that support the early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients with clinical symptoms characteristic of multiple sclerosis.

By virtue of the requirement of demonstrating dissemination in space and time, these diagnostic criteria are highly sensitive, and when met in the context of a typical demyelinating event (i.e. subacute optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, and brainstem syndromes), have a very high positive predictive power for distinguishing early relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis from monophasic clinically isolated syndromes. As currently formulated, before being applied, these diagnostic criteria require the exclusion of alternative causes through clinical evaluation and paraclinical tools (i.e. blood tests, CSF analysis, neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies). Application of diagnostic criteria in the context of clinical presentations that are not typical of multiple sclerosis increases the risk of misdiagnosis.

Since MRI is exquisitely sensitive in detecting white matter abnormalities and just two MRI lesions in specific locations are sufficient to fulfill the multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, careful determination of which imaging features and patterns constitute 'typical' multiple sclerosis lesions ('green flags') and which are atypical ('red flags') is crucial. This is especially pertinent for patients with a small number of lesions and for those with co-morbidities (e.g. migraine or cerebrovascular disease), in whom the identification of specific lesion characteristics and patterns will assist with differential diagnosis.

These considerations provided the impetus to hold a workshop in December 2018 in Milan, Italy, which involved international experts in multiple sclerosis and MRI (Supplementary material). The main goal was to formulate practical guidelines for the correct interpretation and classification of lesions in multiple sclerosis patients that would be helpful both to clinicians involved in multiple sclerosis care and for research studies, ultimately contributing to more accurate diagnosis.

General considerations when using MRI for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis

There are general considerations when applying the MRI aspects of the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis:
The clinical syndrome should be typical of demyelination.
The criteria should be applied to adult patients (between 18 and 50 years); however, they also perform well in identifying paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis from those suffering from monophasic demyelination, although special care is needed in patients under 11 years. In paediatric cases, the presence of at least one black hole (a hypointense lesion on T 1 -weighted sequence) and at least one periventricular lesion at baseline contribute to distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from those with monophasic demyelination. For a comprehensive review of multiple sclerosis differential diagnosis in pediatric population, which is beyond the scope of this review, see.
In patients older than 50 years or with vascular risk factors, more stringent criteria should be considered [e.g. a higher number of periventricular lesions (abutting the lateral ventricles, see below for details)].
MRI studies should be of adequate quality, with few artefacts and performed on scanners with a minimum field strength of 1.5 T. Using 3D acquisitions or 2D with 3-mm thick slices and no gap between slices (see; for MRI protocols proposed and Table 1 for sequence suggestions) will increase diagnostic yield.
Key MRI sequences include T 2 -weighted and T 1 pre- and post-gadolinium images of the brain and the spinal cord (Table 1).
Multiple sclerosis lesions can occur anywhere in the CNS, and thus MRI of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine should be considered in patients with symptoms referable to these locations, and for detecting subclinical lesions (particularly in the spinal cord). Indeed, spinal cord assessment can be helpful in establishing dissemination in space when brain MRI findings are not conclusive and might provide significant prognostic information.
Fat-suppressed MRIs of the optic nerves should be considered especially in atypical cases to rule out possible alternative diagnoses.
Lesions should be confirmed on multiple planes to avoid false positive findings due to artefacts and false negative results (Table 1). The acquisition of 3D sequences [e.g. T 2 -fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T 2 -FLAIR)] can allow multi-planar reconstruction, whilst, especially for 2D acquisitions, a second imaging sequence on a different plane (e.g. sagittal) should be acquired.
Serial imaging can support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, given that multiple sclerosis is characterized by the accrual of lesions over time and in new areas of the CNS.
Interpretation of the MRI scans should be performed by trained (neuro)radiologists or clinicians deeply familiar with the features of multiple sclerosis and disorders considered in the differential diagnosis.
T 2 lesions can increase, decrease or stabilize in size over time; more rarely, small lesions completely disappear.
The pattern of gadolinium-enhancement in multiple sclerosis lesions is variable but almost always transient (2–8 weeks, although typically < 4 weeks).
For the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, there should be at least one typical multiple sclerosis lesion in at least two characteristic regions [periventricular (abutting the lateral ventricles), juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord] to support dissemination in space.
Brain white matter lesions are common in patients with comorbid vascular disease or migraine, as well as healthy adult subjects, and as non-specific small, rounded deep white matter lesions sparing the periventricular zone and U-fibres can also contribute to some of the lesion burden present on imaging. Currently, it is rarely possible to distinguish whether individual lesions are attributable to demyelination or to a comorbidity.
Especially for patients with a small number of lesions, individual lesion characteristics (size, ovoid shape, orientation perpendicular to ventricles, T 1 hypointensity, pattern of enhancement) are important in determining whether they are characteristic of multiple sclerosis; for patients with a large number of lesions, the distribution (periventricular predilection, combinations of brain and cord lesions, etc.) is more relevant.

### New treatment measurements for treatment effects on relapses and progression [^114927Td]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a two stage disease: a first stage in which inflammatory phenomena are crucial and a later one in which degenerative processes become the hallmark. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays of great help both to establish the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. At the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) stage, MRI is an important tool both to predict the appearance of a second attack or the development of disability at long term. In the relapsing-remitting (RR) phase of the disease conventional MRI is probably less helpful to predict future relapses and disability. Cross sectional and longitudinal studies have shown very weak correlations between lesion burden on brain T2 and disability in the progressive forms of MS. Regarding T2 burden of disease, a plateau effect for EDSS values greater than 4.5 has been observed. Measures related to brain or spinal cord atrophy together with MR Spectroscopy, Magnetization Transfer Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging may be useful in the future to better monitor disease progression in the late degenerative phase of the condition. MRI has also been of great help in monitoring the effect of immunomodulatory drugs in CIS or RRMS clinical trials. Its role to predict treatment response is still controversial on an individual basis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by relapsing-remitting or progressive neurologic symptoms and focal white matter lesions. The hallmark of the disease is the dissemination of CNS lesions in space and time, which is defined by the McDonald criteria. MRI is an essential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for MS which can evaluate the entire CNS. MS mimics must be excluded before a diagnosis of MS is made.

MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines

Many patients who present with clinical syndromes typical of inflammatory-demyelination in the CNS are found to have subclinical lesions on MRI scans. The detection of subclinical brain or cord lesions with typical morphology predicts a higher risk of subsequent conversion to MS. Indeed, since 2001 the diagnostic criteria of MS have permitted MR imaging to confirm the diagnosis of MS, either at baseline or after an interval in an individual with a typical clinical syndrome. The MR imaging criteria stipulate the conditions in which the requirements for dissemination of demyelination in space and time can be made in those who have experienced a single clinical attack or a progressive course from onset.

This paper describes the most recent refinement of the MR criteria used to define MS, based on the most contemporary imaging data and techniques. The guidelines are based on the findings of an international workshop, held in March 2015 under the auspices of MAGNIMS (a European collaborative research network that studies the use of MRI in MS). Recommendations are based on both expert opinion and literature review.

The main changes to existing MRI criteria relate to the definition of dissemination in space. The new criteria propose that the optic nerve is incorporated as one of five lesion locations (along with periventricular, infratentorial, cortical/juxtacortical and spinal cord) that can be used to define dissemination in space. The presence of lesions in two out of these five areas is deemed sufficient evidence to define dissemination in space. In all except the periventricular region, only one lesion is required to be present. These most recent guidelines suggest that at least three periventricular lesions should be required to establish dissemination in space at this location, in view of the low specificity of a solitary periventricular lesion. No distinction is required between lesions considered to be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

The criteria for dissemination in time remain unchanged: the detection of either one new T2 lesion or one new gadolinium-enhancing lesion after any interval, or the coexistence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions at any time. In these new recommendations, interval spinal cord imaging is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals for clarification about dissemination in time as clinically silent cord lesions are recognised to be rare.

### Organisational impact and patient management models for biomarker integration in multiple sclerosis care in Italy: the 0Tolerance project [^116gp7qM]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system, ultimately leading to disability. As of 2024, Italy reported 140 000 people with MS (PwMS), representing one of the most prevalent chronic neurological diseases, especially in young adults, with a prevalence of 0.23%. In addition, MS is a highly heterogeneous disease, and its course varies significantly among individuals, particularly in terms of disability progression risk. Currently, MRI remains the primary tool for the diagnosing, prognosing and monitoring MS. However, its role beyond diagnosis is still debated due to its limited ability to capture the full spectrum of underlying disease progression. Hence, additional measures are needed for the detection of subclinical disease activity. Moreover, high demand and sometimes limited availability often cause prolonged waiting times, introducing organisational challenges related to the sustainability of disease monitoring based on MRI only. These limitations underscore the urgent need to incorporate non-invasive, cost-effective and easily repeatable complementary tools into the patient pathway, alongside MRI, for disease monitoring. This would provide more sensitive measures of disease activity, enhance efficiency and accessibility and ultimately enable tailored treatments to prevent relapses and slow disability progression. Thus, in recent years, considerable efforts have been made to identify accurate biomarkers that can complement MRI in understanding disease processes and progression. While the body of knowledge on the clinical relevance of biomarkers for MS is extensive and still debated, their application remains largely confined to research settings and no similar research has assessed the organisational aspects related to their integration into clinical practice.

### Precision medicine in multiple sclerosis: biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response [^111np3Ps]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article highlights recent studies on MRI and body fluid molecular biomarkers with potential implications in diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Recent Findings

In the MS diagnostic process, a reappraisal of well known MRI findings, including symptomatic and spinal cord lesions, and incorporation of newer, more specific, features of MS lesions, such as detection of central veins, are in a testing phase aiming to increase diagnostic accuracy. Lesion counts on T2-weighted scans and gadolinium uptake on postcontrast T1-weighted scans are well established prognostic brain MRI biomarkers. Evidences supporting the implementation of brain volume measures for disease and treatment monitoring are increasing, maybe within a 'zero tolerance' scheme in the overarching no evidence of disease activity concept. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chitinase 3-like 1 and the light subunit of neurofilaments are consolidating their prognostic role in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Blood CD62L and CSF IgM oligoclonal bands may become clinically useful biomarkers for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk stratification in MS patients treated with natalizumab.

Summary

Although more studies are needed, current and emerging imaging and molecular biomarkers in MS may contribute to outline the concept of precision medicine in MS.

### User requirements for quantitative radiological reports in multiple sclerosis [^117VBU3U]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms often leading to progressive and irreversible disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with MS by visualizing lesions and structural changes in the brain and spinal cord. Over the past three decades, advances in automated lesion and brain volume segmentation techniques have revolutionized the analysis of MR images. These automated methods offer increased sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility, and significantly reduced processing time compared to manual segmentation, but have almost exclusively been used for research purposes.

In recent years, these automated segmentation methods have been adapted for the clinical management of MS by the development of both commercial and non-commercial quantitative radiological reports (QReports). QReports offer automated quantification of brain and lesion volumes contextualized by accompanying (normative) reference data. These provide clinicians and patients with potentially valuable information that can be used to support the diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. However, despite the availability of several QReports, few have obtained widespread clinical implementation, possibly due to a lack of alignment with the specific requirements and preferences of clinicians for smooth and meaningful implementation in daily clinical routine, which remain understudied.

Using a Delphi panel method, this study addressed this literature gap by synthesizing a consensus among expert MS clinicians (neurologists and radiologists) regarding user requirements for QReports in MS. Through systematic identification of user requirements, we will provide recommendations that can guide the development of QReports that will improve the quality of care for patients with MS.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^114Y8zKs]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Use of contrast agent

Gd is frequently used for its ability to highlight regions of altered blood–brain barrier and thus areas of active inflammation, thereby providing an indicator of current disease activity and a means to assess DMTs efficacy and safety in PML surveillance. However, evidence suggests a retention of Gd in the body, following a scan. Therefore, the Gd for routine MRI scans should be used when necessary, with specific macrocyclic Gd agents being recommended over linear agents for safety reasons. Since Gd may be used both at diagnosis and during DMTs or natural history monitoring, the authors felt that, in line with published recommendation, Gd should be used only when deemed to be clinically necessary: (1) at diagnosis, (2) in cases of high lesion burden to identify new lesions, (3) to confirm the clinical suspicion of disease activity (e.g. worsening in disability, for which a relapse is suspected, but no clear episode is identifiable), and (4) where it may critically inform treatment decisions (e.g. assessment of treatment efficacy or safety).

### Sodium MRI of multiple sclerosis [^116yffab]. NMR in Biomedicine (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and disease progression are poorly understood, in part as a result of the lack of non-invasive methods to measure and monitor neurodegeneration in vivo. Sodium MRI is a topic of increasing interest in MS research as it allows the metabolic characterization of brain tissue in vivo, and integration with the structural information provided by (1)H MRI, helping in the exploration of pathogenetic mechanisms and possibly offering insights into disease progression and monitoring of treatment outcomes. We present an up-to-date review of the sodium MRI application in MS organized into four main sections: (i) biological and pathogenetic role of sodium; (ii) brief overview of sodium imaging techniques; (iii) results of sodium MRI application in clinical studies; and (iv) future perspectives.

### Present and future of the diagnostic work-up of multiple sclerosis: the imaging perspective [^115EqrLA]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Accurate criteria in the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspicion of MS are crucial not only to enable an early diagnosis, thus allowing treatment to start sooner, but also to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.

The 2017 McDonald criteria are validated and evidence-based criteria that show high sensitivity and accuracy in predicting the occurrence of a second clinical attack, simplify the clinical use of MRI criteria, and allow an earlier diagnosis and treatment of MS. Some concerns have been raised due to their low specificity. However, their application is recommended only after alternative diagnoses have been carefully excluded.

To further improve the diagnostic process, novel candidate imaging biomarkers, such as CVS and chronic active lesions have been proposed to increase the specificity of MS diagnostic criteria, thus reducing the risk of misdiagnosis (Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of newly proposed MRI markers for the diagnostic work-up of MS

3D-EPI three-dimensional echo-planar imaging, DIR double inversion recovery, FLAIR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, Gd gadolinium, MP2RAGE magnetization prepared 2 rapid gradient echoes, MPRAGE magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, MS multiple sclerosis, PSIR phase-sensitive inversion recovery, SWI susceptibility weighted imaging

However, they should be further validated and standardized before being implemented in the clinical setting. In particular, future studies should ascertain their role to exclude alternative diagnoses but also to diagnose MS in patients with both relapse- or progressive-onsets.

Subpial demyelination is highly specific for MS but hardly visible at standard field strengths (i.e. 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla scanners), whereas leptomeningeal enhancement is not MS-specific, since it can be detected in other inflammatory CNS diseases and with ageing.

In the near future, AI approaches may represent a complimentary tool for neurologists and neuroradiologists. Beside visual-pattern recognition performed by experienced clinicians of lesional features typical for MS, which may be time-consuming and hardly reproducible, AI may allow to identify textures and patterns on MRI sequences that are beyond the human perception and may further improve the diagnostic work-up and patients' classification.

### Towards a unified set of diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis [^116TEJb6]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10–15% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) present with slowly worsening symptoms from onset, referred to as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Initial PPMS diagnostic criteria were proposed in 2000, requiring 12 months of progressive worsening, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐specific oligoclonal bands (OCBs), and dissemination in space (DIS) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This approach to PPMS diagnosis has been retained in the McDonald criteria, and diagnostic criteria for PPMS remain distinct from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS). A diagnosis of PPMS, according to the 2017 McDonald criteria, can be made in patients with at least 12 months of disability progression plus 2 of: (1) ≥ 1 T2‐hyperintense lesion in 1 typical brain region: periventricular, cortical/juxtacortical, or infratentorial; (2) ≥ 2 T2‐hyperintense spinal cord lesions; and (3) CSF‐specific OCBs, after excluding other disorders.

The rationale for separate PPMS diagnostic criteria relates to the unique presentation, and wide differential diagnosis for progressive neurological syndromes. However, the need for separate PPMS diagnostic criteria in contemporary practice is unclear. There is increasing consensus that the pathophysiology of RRMS and PPMS share greater similarities than differences. Acute inflammatory demyelinating lesions on MRI (manifesting clinically as acute relapses) occur in PPMS, and neurodegeneration, the main determinant of clinical progression, reflected by brain atrophy, begins early in RRMS. There are calls for a disease classification linked to biological mechanisms that considers MS as a continuum with inflammation and neurodegeneration present at disease onset in all MS patients. Revisions to the disease course classification are expected soon, and will incorporate shared underlying biology between relapsing and progressive MS. The absence of imaging or body fluid biomarkers that differentiate PPMS from RRMSfurther weakens arguments for separate diagnostic criteria. Finally, unified criteria will simplify the diagnostic process, increasing their applicability and ease of use in clinical settings, facilitating earlier treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^114aBQVM]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The most recent classification of disease courses places importance on the presence or absence of disease activity also in the progressive forms of MS. Also, with DMTs licenced in these stage (secondary progressive) or form (primary progressive) of the disease to control active inflammation, the authors felt that an approach to monitoring similar to the one used for relapsing MS would be reasonable, at least in the first few years (Fig. 1). MRI in progressive MS is a field in evolution that is likely to benefit from the introduction of methods to measure brain or cord atrophy in clinical practice.

Monitoring of DMTs safety

Patients treated with natalizumab or exposed to prolonged periods of lymphopenia with other DMTs may be at greater risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients at risk of PML are typically those with anti-John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibodies, who have had treatment with natalizumab for over 18 months and have been given immunosuppressants before receiving natalizumab. There is evidence to suggest that the management of PML is more successful if the condition is detected in a pre-symptomatic state through MRI. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of new lesions is key: any lesions identified after initiating therapy with natalizumab, especially if more than 18 months, should be treated with suspicion. Any MRI changes consistent with PML that occur in immunocompromised patients should be classified as "radiologically-suspected PML". An algorithm has been developed to guide the use of MRI to monitor patients treated with natalizumab, based on anti-JCV antibody status and index value.

MRI acquisition

The detailed definition of a standardised MRI acquisition protocol was beyond the scope of this work, as the authors felt that such protocol for implementation of MRI sequences in the NHS would be more appropriately defined and endorsed by relevant professional bodies. However, the authors identified some characteristics of the MRI acquisition protocol that would be informative and feasible in any clinical setting.

Scanner strength

Different clinical MRI scanners may use different magnetic fields of strength, with higher strengths yielding greater resolution. Thus, when scanning individual patients, changes in scanner strength may generate an inaccurate representation of disease evolution over time, over- or under-estimating MS lesions. Previous scanner strength should be a primary consideration when deciding about future MRI scans to ensure comparability between studies. When moving to a different scanner strength, especially from lower to higher, re-baseline scan is advisable. A minimum magnet strength of 1.5T (T) is important to preserve an adequate level of detail in the images and facilitate reproducibility between centres.

### Predicting multiple sclerosis disease progression and outcomes with machine learning and MRI-based biomarkers: a review [^116e9o23]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers in MS

MRI has proven to be a pivotal imaging biomarker in MS, playing an essential role in diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and outcome assessment. Conventional MRI modalities utilized in MS include T1 (T1w) and T2-weighted imaging (T2w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). WM lesions have a characteristic hyperintense appearance on T2w and FLAIR. Some MS lesions are also visible on T1w as hypointensities and are commonly termed as black holes. When employing gadolinium-based enhancement with T1w images (T1w-Gd), active lesions can be captured through the leakage of Gd through the compromised blood brain barrier, creating a hyperintense appearance.

Classic MRI biomarkers usually involve quantification through the number and volume of these lesions. However, these conventional lesion biomarkers, such as the number of lesions, are only moderately associated with MS clinical disability and disease progression at best, commonly referred to as the clinico-radiological paradox (CLRDP), primarily due to their failure to capture the diffuse effects of the disease on the WM beyond the focal lesions. Resolving this paradox is at the forefront of contemporary MS biomarker research for both cognitive and physical outcomes of MS.

### The central vein sign and its clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a consensus statement from the north American imaging in multiple sclerosis cooperative [^115ZU4Fd]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Over the past few years, MRI has become an indispensable tool for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the current MRI criteria for MS diagnosis have imperfect sensitivity and specificity. The central vein sign (CVS) has recently been proposed as a novel MRI biomarker to improve the accuracy and speed of MS diagnosis. Evidence indicates that the presence of the CVS in individual lesions can accurately differentiate MS from other diseases that mimic this condition. However, the predictive value of the CVS for the development of clinical MS in patients with suspected demyelinating disease is still unknown. Moreover, the lack of standardization for the definition and imaging of the CVS currently limits its clinical implementation and validation. On the basis of a thorough review of the existing literature on the CVS and the consensus opinion of the members of the North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative, this article provides statements and recommendations aimed at helping radiologists and neurologists to better understand, refine, standardize and evaluate the CVS in the diagnosis of MS.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^117AzQgx]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Three main topics were addressed during the workshop: (i) re-examination and definition of features characteristic for individual multiple sclerosis lesions and for patterns of their distribution ('green flags') as defined in the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria; (ii) depiction of lesion patterns that satisfy current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, but are not characteristic of multiple sclerosis. They may be associated with other diseases mimicking multiple sclerosis, an artefact or an incidental lesion related to a comorbidity and constitute 'red flags' for multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Examples include ischaemic lesions, peculiar patterns of contrast enhancement, or age-related 'periventricular capping' on T 2 -weighted images. They also encompass distinctive MRI features of recently recognized antibody-mediated diseases (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and anti-MOG-IgG disease); and (iii) discussion of emerging features of lesions (e.g. central vein sign, subpial demyelination and lesion rims), which are likely, in the near future, to improve specificity of the diagnostic algorithm for multiple sclerosis.

### Misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis: impact of the 2017 McDonald criteria on clinical practice [^112iWhrK]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) (the incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS) remains a problem in contemporary clinical practice. Studies indicate that misdiagnosed patients are often exposed to prolonged unnecessary health care risks and morbidity. The recently published 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS provides an opportunity to consider the effect of these revisions on the problem of MS misdiagnosis. The 2017 McDonald criteria include several new recommendations to reduce potential for misdiagnoses. The criteria should be used for the types of patients in which validation studies were performed, specifically those patients who present with typical demyelinating syndromes. MRI lesion characteristics were defined for which McDonald criteria would be expected to perform with accuracy. However, 2017 revisions, which now include assessment for cortical lesions, and the inclusion of symptomatic lesions and positive oligoclonal bands for the fulfillment of diagnostic criteria, may have the potential to lead to misdiagnosis of MS if not applied appropriately. While the 2017 McDonald criteria integrate issues relating to MS misdiagnosis and incorporate specific recommendations for its prevention more prominently than prior criteria, the interpretation of clinical and radiologic assessments upon which these criteria depend will continue to allow misdiagnoses. In patients with atypical clinical presentations, the revised McDonald criteria may not be readily applied. In those situations, further evaluation or monitoring rather than immediate diagnosis of MS is prudent.

### A 30-year clinical and magnetic resonance imaging observational study of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndromes [^115PFbXA]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly variable condition. Some people with MS accrue little or no neurological disability over decades, 1, 2 whereas others have their life significantly shortened. 3 With a view to preventing long‐term disability, there is growing interest in the early use of MS disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) capable of inducing sustained remission, albeit with the caveat that these may themselves be associated with life‐changing side effects. 4, 5 Given this, it is important that the approach to DMTs should, as far as possible, involve a personalized risk–benefit analysis, ideally early in the disease course.

About 85% of people with MS initially develop the relapsing–remitting form, and first present with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), an episode of neurological symptoms that at least partially resolves. 6 Features associated with more favorable longer‐term outcomes in MS include an early age at symptom onset, an initially relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) course, optic neuritis (ON), or a predominantly sensory CIS, complete remission after a CIS, and a longer interval between the first and second relapse. 1, 7 Following a CIS, a higher initial brain lesion load and greater accrual of lesions over the first 5 years, measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, are associated with an increased likelihood of developing disability within 20 years. 8 Lesions within the brainstem and spinal cord also appear to be associated with a greater risk of subsequent disability. 9, 10 Natural history studies have demonstrated that in the majority of people with RRMS, it took over a decade for their mobility to become limited, and over 2 decades before they were immobile without aids. 7 Given this, assessment of the relationships between early prognostic features and later outcomes ideally requires clinical follow‐up of 2 decades or more.

In this study, we considered 2 main questions: How diverse are clinical outcomes at 30 years following a CIS? Can we identify early on (within 5 years) those who will develop progressive MS or have their life shortened by MS? We addressed these questions using data from a unique cohort of people recruited prospectively following a CIS between 1984 and 1987. 11, 12 The group was followed up clinically and had MRI at 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years. As recruitment predated the DMT era, the cohort was largely untreated.

### A single, early magnetic resonance imaging study in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis… [^117TkMhJ]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

According to the McDonald criteria, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients who present for the first time with a clinically isolated syndrome can be established with brain magnetic resonance imaging if the MRI demonstrates demyelinating lesions with dissemination in space and dissemination in time specific for clinically definite MS, more sensitive, 6and based on the findings of T2-weighted images alone, without the need for gadolinium enhancement. However, because the development of a new T2 lesion is mandatory for demonstrating DIT, at least 2 MRIs are always needed to establish the MRI-based diagnosis of MS, although a minimum interval between symptom onset and the MRI study is not required.
7. Both readers had been trained by experienced neuroradiologists to identify and classify these lesions.

The number and area of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were assessed. The present study shows that a single brain MRI study demonstrating criteria for DIS and at least 1 asymptomatic gadolinium-enhancing lesion may suffice to predict early conversion to CDMS, even when the MRI is performed during the first 3 months after the onset of symptoms. Although this MRI is highly specific for predicting early converters, the sensitivity is rather low; hence, many patients who will ultimately develop MS are not diagnosed with the early MRI. This low sensitivity mainly reflects the selectivity of the MRI diagnostic criteria for DIT.

In clinical practice, MRI of the brain and sometimes of the spinal cord is often obtained within the first days after the onset of symptoms in patients with a CIS, particularly in brainstem and spinal cord syndromes, to rule out a nondemyelinating cause for the clinical symptoms and to confirm or exclude the presence of inflammatory. Our findings suggest that a single brain MRI study may suffice to identify a subset of patients with a CIS who are at high early risk of developing CDMS, even when the MRI is performed within the first 3 months after the onset of symptoms. In the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions that suggest DIT, better diagnostic performance was achieved by using the Swanton or Frohman criteria for DIS and by obtaining the MRI within the first 30 days after symptom onset.

### Initial evaluations for multiple sclerosis in a university multiple sclerosis center… [^113wS7Lk]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Several studies have shown that use of the new criteria facilitates early diagnosis of MS in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome typical of demyelination. 3–6Available treatments appear to work best early in the course of the illness, 7 and interferon β-1a is now Food and Drug Administration–approved for use in patients with a CIS when there are characteristic abnormalities consistent with demyelination present on MRI investigations of the brain or spinal cord. MS/abnormal MRI group. Of the. MS/clinical patients, ultimately 46% were diagnosed with MS or possible MS vs 11% for the. MS/abnormal MRI group. Five of these 12 patients had clinical scenarios highly typical of MS, and the other 7 had symptoms and signs possibly referable to MS. Thus, the MRI was highly unlikely to uncover occult MS in patients without signs and symptoms typical or at least suggestive of MS.

Thus, although MRIs are extremely useful in confirming the diagnosis of MS, defining risk of MS in patients with a CIS, and, partly, in assessing the prognosis of MS, they very rarely, if ever, uncover occult MS in patients with atypical neurological symptoms and signs. In this regard, MRI reports appear to be generating a significant number of referrals in patients with a very low likelihood of MS. A recent report found patients with MS had an average delay in diagnosis of 3. 5 years, and this especially was a problem for patients with early, nonspecific sensory symptoms. 1 Studies published when MRIs were just beginning to be used identified a variety of neoplastic, structural, and vascular lesions that mimicked MS. 18, 19 Indeed, Rudick et al18 reported 10 patients who fulfilled formal diagnostic criteria for MS, yet had certain "red flags" that suggested a reevaluation and subsequent alternative diagnosis. In many of these patients, MRI vastly improved diagnostic acumen.

Our findings are consistent with those offered by Poser20 and emphasize that physicians should evaluate the possibility of MS based on the strength of the clinical history and examination and that MRIs should be obtained in the service of determining whether there is neuroradiological evidence supportive of that clinical diagnosis. Given the very low rate of MS diagnoses in the setting of abnormal MRI results without strong clinical history or examination findings, physicians are probably well-advised to consider other diagnoses besides MS in these contexts even when that issue is raised in neuroradiological reports.

### MRI not accurate for diagnosing MS… [^112hVjQ2]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is magnetic resonance imaging accurate for ruling in or ruling out multiple sclerosis. Setting: Various Study Design: Systematic review. Synopsis: The authors of this systematic review assembled 29 studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in patients suspected of having MS by searching 12 databases and the reference lists of identified studies. Two reviewers selected the studies for inclusion; 18 of the selected studies were cohort studies, and 11 were of lower-quality design. MRI was performed, a diagnosis was made, and patients were monitored for seven months to 14 years to determine whether they had clinically defined MS. Bottom Line: MRI is not particularly useful for ruling in or ruling out MS.

Relying on it to make the diagnosis will result in overdiagnosis of patients, and using it to rule out MS will cause a missed diagnosis in approximately one half of patients who eventually will be diagnosed clinically.

### Magnetic resonance imaging… [^114QLJAE]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Sixty-four patients with possible, probable, or definite multiple sclerosis were clinically evaluated using the expanded disability status scale and Scripps neurologic rating scale. All were examined with a 0. 15T magnetic resonance scanner using T2- and T1-weighted images. Correlations between EDSS and NRS scores and severity of disease detected on magnetic resonance imaging were determined. Significant correlations existed between EDSS and NRS with magnetic resonance ratings. Moderate correlations were observed in the motor, cerebellar, and brainstem subgroups of the clinical scales. Significant low correlations existed in the mood/mentation, vision, and bowel/bladder subgroups. Clinical and neuroimaging limitations may account for the lack of higher correlations.

Significant correlations suggest the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring disease progression, and it may prove to be the technique of choice in following up patients with multiple sclero.
