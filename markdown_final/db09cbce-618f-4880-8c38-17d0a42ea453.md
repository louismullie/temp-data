## Question

can you help me understand this reasoning? "This letter is to document a phone call with Dr. Arduini. He describes a 86yoM with cognitive impairment. Due to urine color change, sediment and change in confusion, a urine sample has been sent to the lab and is growing E.coli.

However, Dr. Arduini is correct that the criteria used for sending the urine are not evidence based and therefore he will not be treating this pathogen".

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about an 86-year-old man with cognitive impairment, new confusion, and a urine culture growing E. coli, and whether antibiotics should be withheld as asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than treated as UTI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it meets criteria for UTI versus asymptomatic bacteriuria. Then, I should verify the epidemiology of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults and how that affects pretest probability. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for cognitively impaired older adults with bacteriuria and delirium. After that, I need to examine the evidence on harms and benefits of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population. Finally, I will consider diagnostic stewardship and outline a practical, guideline-concordant plan, including when to treat and when to observe, with appropriate safety netting [^117VPowJ] [^113cR6bQ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the diagnostic question. The patient is an 86-year-old man with cognitive impairment and new confusion, with a urine culture positive for E. coli, but without reported localizing urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness, and without systemic signs like fever or hemodynamic instability described in the note, which raises the question of asymptomatic bacteriuria with incidental delirium rather than symptomatic UTI [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population because it directly impacts the positive predictive value of a positive urine culture. In older adults, especially those who are institutionalized or functionally impaired, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, with prevalence around 25–50% in women and 15–40% in men, and even higher in some subgroups, which means a positive culture is frequently expected even in the absence of true infection, thereby lowering diagnostic specificity and increasing the risk of false positives when testing is indiscriminate [^114drgDM] [^116Y9vDZ] [^116AYAwx].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before deciding on treatment. The 2019 IDSA asymptomatic bacteriuria guideline issues a strong recommendation, supported by low to moderate quality evidence, to avoid screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults with functional or cognitive impairment who present with delirium or falls but have no local genitourinary symptoms or systemic signs of infection, favoring assessment for alternative causes and careful observation instead of antibiotics [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

> I need to check the evidence on benefits and harms of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this exact context. High-quality evidence shows no reduction in mortality or sepsis from treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults, and randomized and observational data demonstrate increased harms including Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug events, with at least one study associating treatment with worse functional outcomes in delirious inpatients, reinforcing the recommendation to withhold antibiotics in the absence of urinary or systemic infection signs [^115Siep9] [^113cR6bQ] [^112yZRCR].

> But wait, what if the confusion is actually due to a urinary source despite absent localizing symptoms; I should double-check the causal relationship. Systematic reviews and guidelines conclude that the link between bacteriuria and delirium is weak and confounded, and that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to hasten delirium resolution, so I should prioritize evaluation for nonurinary causes of delirium such as medications, metabolic derangements, hypoxia, stroke, or other infections rather than reflexively treating a positive urine culture [^112nebsq] [^117VPowJ] [^111KKK6d].

> Next, I should review diagnostic stewardship because the decision not to treat hinges on how the urine was obtained and why. Indiscriminate urine testing in older adults with nonspecific symptoms drives detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria and subsequent overtreatment; best practice is to avoid sending urine cultures in the absence of new localizing urinary symptoms or systemic infection signs, and to use clinical criteria rather than culture results alone to guide therapy, which aligns with IDSA and stewardship frameworks emphasizing pretest probability and test indication [^116Y9vDZ] [^1141TowA] [^111gDBjm].

> Let me consider the specific triggers mentioned, like urine color change and sediment; I should confirm whether these are valid indications for culture. Cloudy or malodorous urine alone, especially in catheterized or incontinent patients, is not an indication for culture or treatment, and relying on urine appearance or dipstick pyuria in this population is misleading due to the high background prevalence of pyuria and bacteriuria, so these findings should not prompt antibiotics in the absence of compatible symptoms or systemic signs [^1142cwV4] [^1175DN7a] [^113XBv2i].

> I will now examine the risk of progression to clinically significant bacteremia to ensure I am not underestimating harm. Large multicenter data show that among hospitalized patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and altered mental status, bacteremia from a presumed urinary source is rare overall, approximately 1.4%, and only about 0.7% when there are no systemic inflammatory signs, with no single risk factor reliably exceeding a 2% threshold that would justify empiric antibiotics solely for altered mental status, supporting observation rather than treatment in this scenario [^114ChW66] [^117QimLf].

> Let me think about a practical, guideline-concordant plan. I should confirm there are no new urinary symptoms, check vitals for fever or instability, assess for nonurinary causes of delirium, and avoid treating the bacteriuria unless localizing symptoms or systemic infection signs emerge; if the patient later develops dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, fever, rigors, or hemodynamic instability, then I should obtain a properly collected urine specimen and treat as symptomatic UTI per standard practice, ideally with culture guidance if available [^117VPowJ] [^116RajvE].

> Hold on, I should verify that my approach aligns with broader stewardship principles and not just a single guideline. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same message: in older adults with nonspecific symptoms and positive urine cultures, the balance of evidence favors no treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria due to lack of benefit and meaningful risk of harm, reinforcing the need to deprescribe or avoid antibiotics in this situation and to document the rationale clearly for future care transitions [^113cR6bQ] [^115K3ua3] [^112hWfHk].

> In summary, I should confirm that the correct course here is to withhold antibiotics, continue careful monitoring for evolving urinary or systemic signs, and redirect the workup toward nonurinary causes of delirium, because the presentation fits asymptomatic bacteriuria with incidental confusion rather than symptomatic UTI, and treating in this context has not improved outcomes while increasing adverse events, which is precisely why IDSA recommends observation over antibiotics in cognitively impaired older adults with bacteriuria and delirium but no localizing symptoms [^117VPowJ] [^115Siep9].

---

Dr. Arduini's decision not to treat E. coli bacteriuria in an 86-year-old man with cognitive impairment and new confusion is **guideline-concordant** [^117VPowJ] and evidence-based. The IDSA advises against treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults with delirium or falls unless there are local urinary symptoms or systemic signs of infection, because treatment does not improve outcomes and increases harm such as C. difficile and resistance [^113cR6bQ] [^112yZRCR]. Urine color change and sediment are nonspecific and common in asymptomatic bacteriuria; **they are not indications for antibiotics** [^notfound]. The correct approach is to assess for other causes of confusion and observe, reserving antibiotics only if local or systemic signs of UTI emerge [^116wbFyD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The IDSA 2019 guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for managing asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults, including those with cognitive impairment:

- **Do not screen or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Strong recommendation for older adults with functional or cognitive impairment, including long-term care residents [^113cR6bQ] [^111s8y5Z].

- **Delirium without local or systemic signs**: Assess for other causes and observe; do not treat bacteriuria [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

- **Falls without local or systemic signs**: Assess for other causes and observe; do not treat bacteriuria [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

These recommendations reflect the **high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria** in older adults — 15–50% in women and 5–20% in men — and the lack of benefit from treatment [^114drgDM] [^111gDBjm].

---

## Evidence supporting non-treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria

Multiple studies show that treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults **does not improve outcomes** and may cause harm:

- **No mortality benefit**: Treatment does not reduce mortality or subsequent symptomatic UTIs [^113cR6bQ] [^114drgDM].

- **Increased adverse effects**: Higher risk of C. difficile, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug reactions [^113cR6bQ] [^114drgDM].

- **Functional decline**: Treated patients have higher odds of functional decline and longer hospital stays [^112yZRCR] [^115QNZYr].

---

## Specific clinical scenario: 86-year-old male with cognitive impairment

In this case, the patient has **cognitive impairment, new confusion, and E. coli bacteriuria**, but lacks local urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain) or systemic signs (fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia). Urine color change and sediment are nonspecific and common in asymptomatic bacteriuria; they are not indications for antibiotic therapy [^1142cwV4] [^1175DN7a].

---

## Potential risks of unnecessary antibiotic treatment

Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this context carries **significant risks**:

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk, particularly in older adults [^113cR6bQ] [^112yZRCR].

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Treatment promotes resistance, complicating future infections [^113cR6bQ] [^111gDBjm].

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Higher risk of adverse effects, including renal and hepatic toxicity [^113cR6bQ] [^114drgDM].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

The **recommended approach** is to:

- **Assess for other causes**: Evaluate for common causes of delirium (medications, electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, infections elsewhere, metabolic disturbances) [^117VPowJ] [^116wbFyD].

- **Monitor closely**: Observe for the development of local or systemic signs of infection [^117VPowJ].

- **Avoid antibiotics**: Do not initiate antibiotics unless local or systemic signs of UTI develop [^117VPowJ].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Dr. Arduini's decision not to treat E. coli bacteriuria in an 86-year-old man with cognitive impairment and new confusion is **guideline-concordant and evidence-based**. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this context does not improve outcomes and increases the risk of harm. The appropriate course is to assess for other causes of confusion, monitor closely, and reserve antibiotics for patients who develop clear local or systemic signs of infection.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

Older adults with bacteriuria — rationale and evidence on delirium, mental status change, and treatment: The guideline states there is no benefit and high-quality evidence of harm from treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, noting in the elderly that antibiotic treatment likely does not reduce death (relative difference, 13 per 1000 [95% CI, –25 to 85]) or sepsis (RD, 100 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, –260 to 60]). Observational data report higher postoperative bacteriuria in those delirious (8 of 36 [22%]) versus nondelirious (7 of 106 [6.5%]), while a larger cohort found change in mental status associated with bacteriuria plus pyuria in patients treated for UTI (odds ratio [OR], 1.38 [95% CI, 1.03–1.74]). Another cohort found no difference in bacteriuria prevalence with nonspecific symptoms including confusion (31% of 85) versus without such symptoms (32% of 336; p = 0.74). In a randomized trial of older residents with asymptomatic bacteriuria, participants were randomized to norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily or placebo for 7 days (29 per group), and behavioral scores were higher in the treatment group but not statistically different at any time, worsening in both groups (1.18 to 1.91 with norfloxacin and 1.57 to 1.66 with placebo).

Introduction

Delirium is a common finding in older adults, representing 10% of emergency department (ED) visits and occurs in 29–64% among those hospitalized. In such older adults with new or worsening confusion, urinary tract infection (UTI) is often sought and treated with antibiotics, even in the absence of localizing genitourinary symptoms or signs. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is also common in older adults, with a prevalence as high as 25–50%. Delirium and ASB are both more common among older adults with baseline cognitive impairment. Studies have shown little benefit with antibiotic treatment of ASB in patients without delirium, while reiterating its harms. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of literature to guide clinicians managing older adults with delirium and positive urinalysis but without other findings pointing to UTI, especially in inpatient settings. Systematic reviews have found that studies investigating the relationship between UTI/ASB and delirium were methodologically flawed, and the causal relationship between these condition remains elusive. Many studies included in these systematic reviews had no specific definition of UTI other than as noted in the medical records, or included delirium as part of the definition. On the other hand, non-specific symptoms such as altered mental status, lethargy or malaise did not appear to increase the probability of bacterial infection in one study. Recent guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America and the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease of Canada recommend assessment for causes other than UTI in cognitively or functionally impaired older patients with bacteriuria and delirium.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^116Y9vDZ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a positive result from a urine culture test in the absence of minimum symptoms of urinary tract infection, and is present in 30–50% of residents in long term care homes
Indiscriminate testing leads to detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria and prompts unnecessary antibiotic treatment
Strategies to reduce unnecessary urine cultures include targeted education supported by system changes such as modification of order sets and routine panels, elimination of urine dipsticks, and changes to laboratory processing and reporting

An older woman with moderate stage dementia living in a long term care home has new confusion and slurred speech. Her nurse notes an "unusual smell" while collecting a urine specimen and sends it for culture testing to the microbiology laboratory. The care home physician is notified that afternoon of the clinical finding and performs a focused examination, which is unremarkable, and then signs off the urine culture order. The urine culture returns with significant growth of Escherichia coli and the woman is prescribed a course of antibiotics. Five days later, she experiences an acute decline in her clinical status, including worsening dysarthria and right sided weakness, and is transferred to hospital, where a stroke is diagnosed. Focusing on a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), despite the absence of correlating symptoms, has resulted in delayed recognition of stroke symptoms and timely treatment.

Overdiagnosis of UTI is one of the most common reasons for unnecessary use of antibiotics in long term care, including nursing and care homes. Most residents in these settings who have a positive result on urine culture testing do not actually have a UTI but rather asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), defined as the presence of significant levels of bacteria isolated in the urine (greater than 10⁵ colony forming units/mL) in the absence of localising symptoms of UTI, and regardless of the presence of pyuria. Surveillance studies across North America and Europe that systematically assessed symptoms and urine cultures consistently show that in residents of long term care who do not have a catheter, the prevalence of ASB is 30–50%, whereas UTI is far less common, with prevalence of less than 2%. Residents with a catheter have at least a twofold increased risk of UTI, but also have higher rates of ASB that are nearly 100% by the time a urinary catheter has been in place for four weeks.

### Are antibiotics helpful for older adults with delirium and pyuria or bacteriuria? [^112eAry9]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics for Delirium and Pyuria or BacteriuriaDelirium is common among hospitalized older adults, frequently leading to initiation of antibiotics when pyuria or bacteriuria is detected. However, it is difficult to determine if pyuria or bacteriuria is the cause of delirium or incidentally identified. This article proposes a trial to assess if treatment with antibiotics hastens delirium resolution.

### The scientific evidence for a potential link between confusion and urinary tract infection in the elderly is still confusing-a systematic literature review [^114Erpxa]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well documented that lower urinary tract infection (UTI) should only be diagnosed when there are new onset localising genitourinary signs and symptoms and a positive urine culture result. However, despite new onset or worsening of confusion being a non-specific symptom, it continues to be the most common reason for suspecting a lower UTI in elderly patients, often leading to antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of UTI is further complicated by the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in nursing home residents, varying between 25 and 50% for women and 15–40% for men, without an indwelling urinary catheter. While urine cultures can guide the choice of antibiotic, their poor positive predictive value means a positive culture alone should not warrant initiation of antibiotics. Additionally, evidence suggests patients with confusion and dementia are more likely to be continuously bacteriuric. Due to all of these confounding factors, new onset or worsening of non-specific symptoms in residents is one of the major diagnostic challenges in caring for the elderly.

Subsequently, many different consensus based criteria to enable appropriate diagnosis of UTI have been devised, most notably the revised Mcgeer and updated Loeb criteria. Despite the difficulty of diagnosing UTI, there is sound evidence that elderly residents with symptomatic lower UTI should receive antibiotic treatment and elderly residents with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not. Although inappropriate antibiotic use results in those few residents suffering from a lower UTI to be treated promptly, it leads to significant overdiagnosis of UTI and potentially harmful outcomes through misdiagnosis. With many residents receiving unnecessary antibiotics with possible adverse reactions, and the ever-increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, it is evident that inappropriate antibiotic use in this population must be reduced.

A previous literature review conducted by Balogun et al. exclusively reviewed the association between symptomatic UTI and delirium in the elderly in five publications. It concluded that there may be an association between symptomatic UTI and delirium; however, some methodological flaws may have led to biased results. It was limited by only using the term delirium and excluding terms like confusion, resulting in many publications potentially being excluded. In addition, Balogun et al. only searched the Medline database potentially missing important publications.

UTI is a broad diagnosis encompassing infections arising from all levels of the urinary tract, ranging in severity from acute cystitis to acute pyelonephritis. This systematic review aims to review the evidence for the association between acute cystitis or bacteriuria and confusion in the elderly in all care settings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113cR6bQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in functionally impaired older adults and long-term care residents — screening and treatment: In older, community-dwelling persons who are functionally impaired, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and in older persons resident in long-term care facilities, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence notes that only 16% of bacteriuric residents with advanced dementia met minimum criteria for symptomatic UTI, but 75% of these received treatment; antimicrobial therapy conferred no survival benefit (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 1.09 [95% CI, .43–2.75] for oral therapy vs no therapy, and 1.83 [95% CI, .44–7.60] for intramuscular therapy vs no therapy); increased frequency of bacteriuric episodes was significantly associated with an increased frequency of receiving an antimicrobial or subsequent isolation of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in urine, but not changes in mental status or admission to hospital for UTI; and the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) within 3 months of therapy was > 8.5-fold higher for patients who received antimicrobial treatment than those who did not.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^113XBv2i]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Barriers to change

Requesting urine cultures in the absence of minimum symptoms of UTI leads to detection of ASB, prompting unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Large retrospective and prospective cohort studies conducted in long term care homes across several countries show that only a small fraction of urine specimens collected in long term care meet minimum symptom criteria for culturing, and that up to 80% of residents with ASB had unnecessary urine testing.

The urine dipstick, which is known for its sensitivity in ruling out presence of UTI in younger populations and foregoing a urine culture, may contribute to over diagnosis of UTI in older patients. Unlike in younger populations, where pyuria is generally absent when non-infected, the prevalence of pyuria among long term care residents is nearly universal, and these positive dipsticks trigger urine cultures and occasionally empiric antibiotics in the absence of localising symptoms of UTI.

Residents in long term care homes may have cognitive impairment, which can limit available history, and may present atypically with infection. Staff may fear missing a UTI, or even believe that upfront treatment of ASB can prevent a UTI in the future, despite evidence suggesting the contrary. A urine culture may be perceived to be a more objective assessment that provides a possible diagnostic explanation for non-urinary complaints. Therefore, the clinical presentations used to evoke the presence of UTI are excessively broad; common presentations such as falls, poor oral intake, lethargy, and delirium frequently trigger a urine dipstick or culture as a means of excluding a UTI, even in the absence of clear localising urinary symptoms — with positive results used to support that diagnosis.

Urine cultures may also be integrated into existing order sets and routine panels, which drives overuse and detection of ASB. A recent US survey presented a case of ASB to 551 primary care physicians, and found that more than 70% would prescribe antibiotics. Ninety per cent of those who opted to treat believed the patient had a UTI, even though they lacked any of the cardinal symptoms.

Family members and care givers may specifically request urine testing when a care home resident's condition is altered. Prior experiences of both prescribers and care givers can generate causal inferences based on prior episodes where urine cultures were positive, and these can become particularly challenging to dissociate if improvement in the person's condition coincided with receipt of antibiotics previously.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, antibiotic use, and suspected urinary tract infections in four nursing homes [^115UbqRF]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

One of the major issues in antibiotic stewardship in nursing homes is the use of antibiotics to treat suspected UTIs. Despite extensive research demonstrating a lack of benefit and a potential for harm for antibiotic use for ASB, this practice continues to be prevalent among clinicians serving nursing home residents. This study found a substantial proportion (50%) of antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI was given to asymptomatic residents. Our results were also consistent with previous research that identified fluoroquinolones as the most common type of antibiotic used to treat UTIs.

Somewhat surprisingly, our results indicated that resident demographics or indicators of health and functional status did not affect the likelihood of receipt of an antibiotic despite the absence of physical symptoms for UTI. Several resident conditions such as diabetes, stroke and causes of urinary tract dysfunction were not included in these data. Nonetheless, these results imply that differences in health and functional status among residents are not a driving force behind prescribing antibiotic treatment for ASB.

Our results provide evidence of the overwhelming importance of the presence or absence of an indwelling urinary catheter in the use of antibiotics for ASB. Our results from these four homes indicate that over 80 percent of the antibiotics prescribed for individuals with a catheter were written in the absence of signs or symptoms of a UTI. However, they were usually written in the presence of urinalysis results.

Previously published infection surveillance criteria for UTIs in long term care facilities have given too little attention to laboratory data as part of the diagnostic paradigm. However, in these data, we found widespread use of urine testing in the absence of signs and symptoms recognized in clinical guidelines as indicating the presence of a UTI. These results suggest that diagnostic testing may play a major role in the use of antibiotics for ASB.

Our data highlight the need for further assessment of how the interpretation of these tests might drive prescribing decisions in this setting. The medical literature emphasizes that older persons with a UTI may present differently than younger persons. Thus, a wide range of events may prompt the ordering of urinalyses - any change in cognitive status, change in behaviors, changes in the color or smell of urine, or even a fall. For cognitively impaired residents with limited communication abilities, any signs of discomfort or functional change may result in a urinalysis. However, given the prevalence of ASB, there is a high likelihood that any urinalysis will be abnormal and subsequent culture positive.

Results

Study population

Of the 146 residents, 116 were eligible and screened for ABU at baseline (S1a). Thirty residents were not enrolled because no informed consent was received (n = 23), because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (n = 2), deceased before sampling (n = 3) or were unable to deliver a urine sample (n = 2). Of the 116 that participated, 101 and 97 participants were included in the analyses of sampling round S1 and S2, respectively. Fifteen (S1) and 19 (S2) participants were excluded because of catheterization, antibiotic treatment, suspected urinary tract infections, not being able to give a urine sample, withdrawing from the study or being deceased. Six participants were included only in the analysis of S2, but not of S1. Ninety-one participants were included in both analyses.

The median age of the participants included in the analysis was 86 (range 67–104) at baseline for both S1 and S2, with participants housed in the residential home being only slightly younger (median age 84, range 71–93) than those accommodated in the nursing home (median age 86, range 67–104). Most of the participants were female (80%). Dementia (S1: 23%, S2: 22%), continuous incontinence (S1: 40%, S2: 36%) and being wheelchair-enabled (S1: 37%, S2: 32%) were common conditions. Detailed characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1. Importantly, none of the residents received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent UTIs.

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants and prevalence rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria in each subgroup at sampling rounds S1 and S2

Prevalence rates of ABU

In each sampling round, ABU occurred in 40 participants (S1: 40%; S2: 41%). During the 3-month study period, 7 out of 40 subjects with ABU in S1 no longer had ABU in S2, while 9 acquired ABU newly by the time of S2 (Fig. 2). In one participant, the species causing ABU changed from Escherichia coli in S1 to Citrobacter koseri in S2. These 17 cases were defined as transient ABU. Twenty-seven of the 91 participants (30%) that participated in both sampling rounds had ABU with the same species throughout S1 and S2 and were defined as long-term ABU.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^1125faK7]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of UTI in geriatric patients can be challenging due to defective communication, functional disability and the existence of chronic LUTS usually not attributable to UTI. Although non-specific changes in the clinical status of older patients such as delirium, increased falls, fatigue or loss of appetite, are frequently attributed to UTI, particularly in the presence of a positive urine culture, the value of these symptoms as indicators of a proper UTI has been questioned. According to a recent decision tool for deciding empiric antimicrobial treatment in frail older adults with suspected UTI and the 2019 IDSA guidelines for the management of ASB, most non-specific symptoms in the absence of LUTS or other signs of infection should not be attributed to UTI. Therefore, due to the high prevalence of pyuria and ASB in older patients, urinalysis should only be performed when signs and symptoms of UTI are present.

In our study, FUTI in older males were less commonly caused by E. coli with an increased frequency of infections due to other gram-negative bacteria, which is in accordance with previous studies. E. coli isolated from older males exhibited increased resistance rates to cefuroxime, gentamicin, and FQ. We also observed a higher prevalence of ESBL and AmpC producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. strains with rates similar to the ones reported by Alvarez et al. among older patients with UTI. The impact of age in the frequency of FUTI caused by MDRO has been observed in some studies but not in others. Interestingly, men seem to have an increased risk of infection with ESBL-producing Enterobacteria and other MDRO compared to women.

In the multivariate analysis, coming from an LTCF, having a urinary tract abnormality and recent antimicrobial use were independently associated to FUTI caused by MDRO. Residing in an LTCF has been identified as a risk factor for infection caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteria. Pulcini et al. showed that older people from nursing homes had a 40% risk of having an antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from the urine compared to their community peers. More recently, McKinnell et al. estimated a prevalence of MDRO colonization in older people from nursing homes and long-term acute care facilities of 65 and 80% respectively. All these studies support the role of LTCF as reservoirs of MDRO.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^117QimLf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Patients With AMS

Among patients with ASB, 5059 (43.6%) had AMS (Figure). Of these, 89 (1.8%) were found to have bacteremia from a presumed urinary source (vs 72 [1.1%] in patients without AMS). Risk of bacteremia in patients with AMS differed 4-fold based on whether they had systemic signs of infection (ie, evidence of SIRS or leukocytosis): 0.7% (17 of 2610) for patients without systemic signs of infection (number needed to treat, 154) vs 2.9% (72 of 2449) for patients with systemic signs of infection (number needed to treat, 34). Differences based on whether patients had dementia are shown in the Figure.

Figure.
Bacteremia From a Presumed Urinary Source Among Hospitalized Patients With Bacteriuria and Altered Mental Status With or Without Dementia

SBP indicates systolic blood pressure; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome; UTI, urinary tract infection.

Variables and Outcomes Associated With Bacteremia From a Presumed Urinary Source

In unadjusted comparisons, patients with ASB who developed bacteremia from a presumed urinary source were older (median [IQR] age, 79.5 [72.2–88.2] years) than patients who did not develop bacteremia (median [IQR] age, 78.2 [67.7–86.6] years; z score, 2.32; p = 0.02). Symptoms or comorbidities associated with developing bacteremia from a presumed urinary source included presentation with AMS with or without dementia, complicated urologic history, indwelling catheter, change in urine characteristics, fatigue, functional decline, and urinary retention (see Table 1 for details). Diagnostic findings associated with development of bacteremia from a presumed urinary source included: serum leukocytosis, elevated urinalysis parameters (ie, pyuria or leukocyte esterase), and growth of Escherichia coli (compared with other pathogens) (Table 1).

Patients with ASB who developed bacteremia from a presumed urinary source had higher unadjusted mortality (9.3% vs 4.5%; χ²₁ = 8.24; p = 0.004) and median (IQR) duration of hospitalization after urine culture (6 [4–7] vs 4 [3–6] days; z score, 7.08; P < .001) than those without bacteremia. Other outcomes including 30-day readmission, 30-day ED visit, and CDI event at 30 days were similar between the 2 groups (Table 1).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112yZRCR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults with delirium or after falls — observational data and panel rationale emphasize limited benefit and potential harm from antimicrobials. In hospitalized cohorts with ASB and no focal urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms, 44 (66%) of 67 had confusion or delirium and 43 (64%) were treated with antimicrobials, and those with confusion had higher treatment rates (75% vs 43%; OR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19–4.12]). In a prospective study, hospitalized patients aged ≥ 70 years were screened for delirium every 2 days; delirious patients treated for ASB had poorer functional outcome (adjusted OR, 3.45 [95% CI, 1.27–9.38]) and were more likely to develop CDI (OR, 2.45 [95% CI, .86–6.96]). Regarding falls, a nursing home review found 39 (48%) of 80 fallers had pyuria and bacteriuria and were diagnosed as UTI, whereas in a cohort of suspected UTI only 9 of 45 (20%) fall episodes had bacteriuria and pyuria, with the remaining 80% had no bacteriuria and pyuria; these studies suggest that most older residents who fall do not have ASB and falls should not immediately trigger suspicion for UTI. Current evidence does not suggest a causal relationship between bacteriuria and delirium or falls, and treatment of ASB in delirious patients has not been shown to have any beneficial impact on clinical outcomes (all low or very low certainty). There is high certainty that antimicrobials cause harm, including probable increases in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including CDI) and antimicrobial resistance. In patients who fall and have fever or hemodynamic instability, careful evaluation to identify a site of infection is warranted.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^114drgDM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". ASB prevalence increases with age: in community women age 65 to 90 it ranges from 6% to 16%, is highest in women age 90 and older at 22% to 43%, and in community men age 65 and older it ranges from 5% to 21%, with the highest prevalence in those age 90 and older; in institutionalized elderly, 25% to 50% of women and 15% to 35% of men have ASB. Antimicrobial therapy for ASB has no short- or long-term benefits for mortality, genitourinary symptoms, or subsequent symptomatic episodes and in acute-care settings causes adverse drug reactions and re-infection with more-resistant organisms; although in long-term-care facilities individuals with bacteriuria are at greater risk of symptomatic infection, this is not attributable to bacteriuria. Identifying symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in frail or cognitively impaired elderly is often challenging, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America has published proposed criteria for initiation of antibiotics and surveillance definitions for nursing homes. For older adults with ASB undergoing traumatic genitourinary procedures with mucosal bleeding, antimicrobial treatment is supported in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^115QNZYr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

Exposures

One or more antibiotic dose for treatment of ASB.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Results

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%); median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15–2.13), acutely altered mental status (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.23–3.04), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.36–2.41), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10 000/μL) (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00), positive urinalysis (presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field) (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.05–3.93), and urine culture with a bacterial colony count greater than 100 000 colony-forming units per high-power field (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.83–2.91). Treatment of ASB was associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing (4 vs 3 days; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.28–1.47). No other differences in secondary outcomes were identified after propensity weighting.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with ASB commonly receive inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic treatment did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes; rather, treatment may be associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing. To possibly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, stewardship efforts should focus on improving urine testing practices and management strategies for elderly patients with altered mental status.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116AYAwx]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is common in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and was shown to account for 22% of all infections and more than 50% of the antibiotic prescriptions in this setting. However, in institutionalized older adults, UTI is difficult to differentiate from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). ABU prevalence rates in LTCFs are high, ranging from 25 to 50% in women and from 15 to 40% in men. Such high ABU prevalence rates obviously compromise the value of a positive urine culture as a diagnostic criterion for UTI. In addition, assessing symptoms of a UTI is challenging in this population. Institutionalized older adults, especially those with mental impairment or chronic symptoms, are often incapable of recognizing or communicating the presence of symptoms. Moreover, this geriatric population frequently exhibits atypical manifestations of acute disease and presents with nonspecific symptoms. As UTI can cause severe infections, practitioners are prone to diagnose a UTI relying solely on vague symptoms such as changes in behavior or changes in the appearance of urine rather than typical symptoms of a UTI such as dysuria, frequency or urgency. Residents of LTCFs thus frequently receive antibiotics due to a suspected infection, resulting in a significant overuse of antimicrobials. Treatment of ABU in this population is however not recommended because of potential adverse effects and a lack of efficacy in preventing subsequent UTIs. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that ABU protects against infection.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Associations of delirium with urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults aged 65 and older: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nebsq]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of delirium in persons aged 65 and older (older adults) varies, depending on the method of assessment and the population studied, from 18%–35% in the general medical ward, to 20%–22% in nursing homes, 25% in geriatric units, and 7%–50% in intensive care units. Delirium in older adults is associated with prolonged hospital stays, complexity of care, institutionalization and high mortality rates as well as considerable difficulties for caregivers and increased healthcare costs.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) among older adults is also associated with a high number of cases annually and high healthcare costs. The diagnosis of UTI requires not only confirmed bacteriuria but also the presence of genitourinary symptoms, which often cannot be reliably confirmed in the many delirious individuals who are unable to adequately express themselves, thus posing a challenge to the clinical assessment of such patients. When bacteriuria is detected in older adult patients, many clinicians consider behavioral or mental changes, including delirium, as non‐urinary (also called "non‐specific") manifestations of UTI, especially in patients with cognitive impairment, from whom local urinary tract symptoms are often difficult to obtain.Сlinicians often prescribe antibiotics for delirium in patients with confirmed bacteriuria, based on the assumption that anti‐bacterial treatment will manage non‐specific psychiatric symptoms and improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^111dR8Fc]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical characteristics

In the study population of 1052 patients examined by a dipstick, a classic UTI symptom was present at admission among 184/1052 (17%) patients. The type of urine sample was not reported in 860/1052 (81%), from a newly placed urinary catheter in 111/1052 (11%), from a permanent urinary catheter in 79/1052 (8%) and 'other' in 2/1052 (0.2%). The indication for dipstick analysis was not reported in the electronic medical records in 632/1052 (60%) of patients. In the remaining patients, the attending physician explicitly listed suspected UTI or unknown infection as indications in 393/1052 (37%), suspected gross haematuria or kidney stones in 13/1052 (1%), proteinuria in 7/1052 (0.7%) and ketoacidosis in 3/1052 (0.3%). Overall, dipsticks were interpreted as 'probable UTI' in about half of patients with strong reaction for LE, nitrite or both (online supplemental table 1).

Urine cultures were carried out in 609/1052 (58%) of which 272/609 (45%) were positive. Escherichia coli was the most commonly identified bacterium and was found in 139/272 (51%) of cultured urine samples (online supplemental table 2). The proportions with significant bacteriuria did not differ noticeably between patients with or without specific symptoms of UTI, dementia, confusion, a history of fever and in those with symptoms from other organ systems than the genitourinary tract (online supplemental table 3).

The mCDC criteria of UTI were fulfilled by 89/1052 (8%) of patients. In contrast, a final clinical diagnosis of UTI was assigned by the attending physician in 155/1052 (15%) patients of which 43/155 (28%) were confirmed according to the mCDC criteria. The in-hospital mortality was 4%.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^112gHR5K]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in institutionalized older adults is often based on vague symptoms and a positive culture. The high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which cannot be easily discriminated from an acute infection in this population, is frequently neglected, leading to a vast over-prescription of antibiotics. This study aimed to identify subpopulations predisposed to transient or long-term ABU.

Methods

Residents in a long-term care facility were screened for ABU. Mid-stream urine samples were collected during two sampling rounds, separated by 10 weeks, each consisting of an initial and a confirmative follow-up sample.

Results

ABU occurred in approximately 40% of the participants and was mostly caused by Escherichia coli. Long-term ABU (> 3 months) was found in 30% of the subjects. The frailest women with urinary incontinence and dementia had drastically increased rates of ABU and especially long-term ABU. ABU was best predicted by a scale describing the functional independence of older adults.

Conclusions

Institutionalized women with incontinence have ABU prevalence rates of about 80% and are often persistent carriers. Such prevalence rates should be considered in clinical decision making as they devalue the meaning of a positive urine culture as a criterion to diagnose UTIs. Diagnostic strategies are urgently needed to avoid antibiotic overuse and to identify patients at risk to develop upper UTI.

### Antimicrobial treatment ameliorates delirium-like phenotypes in a murine model of urinary tract infection [^113b1ssK]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a highly prevalent clinical condition with more than 400 million cases per year worldwide. Delirium, which presents with acute confusion, occurs in up to one-third of patients and is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and an increased risk of incident or progressive Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).

UTI is distinguished from asymptomatic bacteriuria by the presence of classic focal genitourinary symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness. However, delirious patients, who may be suspected to have UTI, often demonstrate bacteriuria without complaints of focal genitourinary symptoms and are thus considered asymptomatic. The current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) practice guidelines recommend in cognitively impaired patients "assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment" (ABX), citing both a lack of a causal relationship between bacteriuria and delirium and an apparent lack of benefit with ABX in patients who do not complain of focal genitourinary symptoms.

These IDSA guidelines, however, acknowledge the low-quality evidence that inform these recommendations and call for studies to clarify potential causal relationships between UTI and delirium and evaluate putative benefits of ABX on mental status. Recent developments in animal models now facilitate these investigations - our mouse model of UTI-induced delirium recapitulates a common clinical scenario where acute behavioral changes, i.e. delirium-like phenotypes, are considered the only presenting sign of UTI where cognitive impairment due to delirium may not allow elicitation of the presence of focal genitourinary symptoms.

In recent studies, we demonstrated a central pathological role for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans -signaling pathway in orthogonal etiologies of delirium, which have been subsequently validated in clinical populations. Although these studies demonstrate the feasibility to leverage pharmacology to reverse delirium-like phenotypes after acute systemic injuries, it remains unknown whether ABX alone may ameliorate UTI-induced delirium-like phenotypes.

Accordingly, we hypothesize the existence of a causal relationship between UTI and delirium-like phenotypes that is mitigated by ABX.

Treatment

Antibiotic treatment by ceftriaxone was maintained initially because of the worsening neurological condition, despite the blood and urine cultures revealing a multisensitive Escherichia coli and the favourable clinical evolution of the urinary infection the days prior. After reasonably excluding structural brain lesions, a central nervous system (CNS) infection, epileptiform activity and electrolyte perturbations, we finally attributed the clinical symptoms to ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy on day 7. The medication was discontinued, with a switch to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (intravenous first and per os later).

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^111Me96U]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Setting and study population

The Leiden 85-plus Study is an observational population-based prospective study of 85-year-old inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands. Between September 1997 and September 1999, all inhabitants of Leiden who reached the age of 85 years were invited to participate in the study. There were no selection criteria concerning health or demographic characteristics. The medical ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved the study. All participants gave informed consent for the whole study including the use of data from their medical records for additional analysis, following explanation of the study requirements and assurance of confidentiality and anonymity. For participants with severe cognitive impairment, a guardian gave informed consent.

The present study was conducted within the framework of the Leiden 85-plus Study. We started follow-up for four years at age 86 years to allow us to study 'history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years' as a possible predictor. In this study, 479 participants aged 86 years were included. Participants were revisited annually until the age of 90 years. All participants were visited at their place of residence where face-to-face interviews were conducted, cognitive testing was performed, information on socio-demographic characteristics and disabilities in daily living was obtained, and a venous blood sample was taken.

Urinary tract infection

The endpoint of this study was the development of the first UTI from age 86 through 90 years. This endpoint was considered present when treating physicians diagnosed UTI based on signs and symptoms and urine analysis.

The endpoint was also reached when a participant during follow-up died from UTI. General practitioners and elderly care physicians were interviewed annually to gather clinical information. Each year data were gathered about the development of clinical diagnosed UTI during the preceding year from clinician interviews and records. Mortality data were obtained from the municipality. Specific data on causes of death were obtained from Statistics Netherlands, according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Disorders, 10 th revision (ICD-10), including UTI (ICD-10 code N39.0).

Selection of potentially predictive factors

Through an extensive search of scientific literature factors that are potentially predictive for UTI in older individuals were identified and selected for the study, within the domains socio-demographic factors, functioning, co-morbidities and renal functioning.

Socio-demographic factors

During baseline interviews, a research nurse collected information about the participants' residency, income, level of education, body mass index and smoking habits.

### Barriers and facilitators of appropriate antibiotic use in primary care institutions after an antibiotic quality improvement program-a nested qualitative study [^1156fPTp]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Unclear clinical presentation

Unclear clinical manifestations caused by infections, especially in cognitively impaired residents, were regarded as major contributors to diagnostic uncertainty and difficult treatment decisions. Some physicians highlighted the difficulty of distinguishing viral from bacterial respiratory tract infections, due to a perception that frail and old residents with viral respiratory tract infections often present with typical hallmarks of bacterial infections like fever, crackles over the lungs and increased C-reactive protein concentrations. Identifying bacterial aetiology was pointed out as a relevant challenge, especially during flu seasons, which often led to uncertainty among physicians regarding the initiation of antibiotics. In such cases, the resident's general condition was described as decisive for whether antibiotic treatment should be initiated. Several physicians described that they had a lower threshold for starting antibiotic treatment in residents with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when in doubt about the microbiological cause of the respiratory infection. Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) was perceived as challenging, especially in demented residents, due to non-specific symptoms, poor anamnesis and high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, leading to a high level of uncertainty. Both physicians and nurses described several approaches to uncertain UTI situations, including watchful waiting, intravenous fluid therapy and antibiotic prescribing to be on the safe side. With uncertain focus of infections, several of the physicians and nurses described that broad-spectrum antibiotics were often prescribed to cover both the airways and urinary tract system. One of the physicians claimed that in cases where residents presented with new-onset non-specific symptoms, like confusion and agitation, it was better to try a short-term course of antibiotics than more side-effect burdened medications.

Physician, male, 35–39 years: "They do not have the clear urinary tract infection symptoms. They can be agitated and have a positive urine stick. Instead of starting up with haloperidol or something similar, it is after all a bit better to give a course of pivmecillinam to check if a urinary tract infection is the cause. Therefore, you treat a little more on vague indications".

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^113dSRKk]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common among the oldest old and may lead to a few days of illness, delirium or even to death. We studied the incidence and predictive factors of UTI among the oldest old in the general population.

Methods

The Leiden 85-plus Study is a population-based prospective follow-up study of 86-year-old subjects in Leiden, The Netherlands. Information on the diagnosis of UTI was obtained annually during four years of follow-up from the medical records and interviews of treating physicians. A total of 157 men and 322 women aged 86 years participated in the study. Possible predictive factors were collected at baseline, including history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years, aspects of functioning (cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) < 19), presence of depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) > 4), disability in activities of daily living (ADL)), and co-morbidities.

Results

The incidence of UTI from age 86 through 90 years was 11.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4, 13.1) per 100 person-years at risk. Multivariate analysis showed that history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years (hazard ratio (HR) 3.4 (95% CI 2.4, 5.0)), impaired cognitive function (HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.3, 2.9)), disability in daily living (HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1, 2.5)) and urine incontinence (HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.1)) were independent predictors of an increased incidence of UTI from age 86 onwards.

Conclusions

Within the oldest old, a history of UTI between the age of 85 and 86 years, cognitive impairment, ADL disability and urine incontinence are independent predictors of developing UTI. These predictive factors could be used to target preventive measures to the oldest old at high risk of UTI.

### Comorbidities associated with a clinically-recognized delirium diagnosis in the hospital using real world data [^113qA8u1]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The large number of patients also enabled us to dissect the diagnostic associations with delirium in a sex-stratified manner. Our findings point to potentially new biological insights into the pathophysiology of delirium that are sex dependent. For instance, male patients had a significant association with Clostridioides difficile infections, an infection that often develops after antibiotic use. This could point to either the Clostridioides difficile toxin and the downstream consequences of the infection being associated with delirium or the antibiotic that was used that led to the infection being associated with delirium. Meanwhile, Klebsiella and E. coli infection were enriched in female patients with delirium, organisms that most commonly cause urinary tract infections, a source of infection more common in females compared to males. Dementia, one of the known risk factors of delirium, is also known to have sex-biased features, including in prevalence, clinical progression, and neuropathological findings. Interestingly, our association studies found that subtypes of dementia were associated with delirium in a sex-dependent manner. The caveat to these diagnoses is that there may be baseline biases of ordering certain tests for one sex versus another (for example, urinalyses obtained more frequently in female patients to assess urinary tract infections compared to male patients) as well as sex difference in the rates/prevalence of certain diseases and diagnoses. Further studies will need to be done to understand whether this is due to these underlying biases or underlying sex differences in the prevalence of these dementia subtypes or sex differences in the pathophysiology of these dementias contributing to delirium.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^116DjuoS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials & Methods

All consecutive patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis within a single healthcare system during July 2019 were identified by the ICD‐10 diagnostic code (Appendix SA). The healthcare system utilized was a large tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. July 2019 was selected to avoid any alterations in treatment delivery resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Patients demonstrating clinical signs or hemodynamic features of bacteremia, positive blood cultures, medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTI (e.g. indwelling catheter, recent urologic surgery, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, or transplant), or those admitted for inpatient care were excluded, resulting in a cohort of 909 patients.

2.1 Data Collection

Manual chart review was utilized to extract demographic (e.g. age, gender), clinical (e.g. symptoms), and microbial (e.g. features of microscopic urinalysis, urine microbiological testing) data from patients who met inclusion criteria. We also catalogued antibiotic treatments used, alternative diagnoses explored, and urine culture and susceptibility results. Symptoms were designated as "acute" if arising < 7 days before the encounter and "chronic" when present for > 28 days before presentation. The presence of "UTI symptoms", specified by the American Urological Association and expert consensus, was defined as either dysuria or hematuria with at least one additional urinary symptom, including urinary urgency, urinary frequency, worsening incontinence, or suprapubic pressure in the absence of any vaginal symptoms. "Mental Status Changes" (MSC) captured symptomatology such as altered mental status, confusion, and lethargy. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, or Enterococcus faecalis were defined as the most common "uropathogenic" bacteria, while all other species were designated as atypical bacteria. Risk factors for complicated UTIs such as anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, systemic disease, immunodeficiency, pregnancy, or history of multidrug resistance bacteria were not collected. Clinical definitions are defined in Appendix SB.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: a cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^1178igct]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) among residents of nursing homes for the elderly varies between 25% and 50% for women and 15% and 40% for men. There is overwhelming evidence that ABU should not be treated with antibiotics in an adult population except for pregnant women and patients prior to traumatic urologic interventions with mucosal bleeding. The high prevalence of ABU makes it difficult to know if a new symptom in a resident with bacteriuria is caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), or if the bacteria in the urine is only representative of an ABU. This is especially difficult in the presence of symptoms not specific to the urinary tract such as fatigue, restlessness, confusion, aggressiveness, loss of appetite or frequent falls.

Nonspecific symptoms such as changes in mental status are the most common reasons for suspecting a UTI among residents of nursing homes. These symptoms can have many causes besides UTI. There are different opinions on the possible connection between different nonspecific symptoms and UTI. Nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic uncertainty often lead to antibiotic treatments of dubious value. Urine culture alone seems inappropriate for evaluating symptoms among residents of nursing homes. There are two major possible explanations, either common bacteria in the urine are of little relevance, or a urine culture is insufficient to identify UTI.

With the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the antimicrobial drug discovery pipeline currently running dry, it is important not to misinterpret bacteriuria as UTI and prescribe antibiotics when it actually represents ABU. Thus, a complementary test to discriminate between symptomatic UTI and ABU is needed. The cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a mediator of inflammation playing an important role in the acute phase response and immune system regulation. The biosynthesis of IL-6 is stimulated by e.g. bacteria. After intravesical inoculation of patients with E. coli, all patients secreted IL-6 into the urine, however, serum concentrations of IL-6 did not increase suggesting a dominance of local IL-6 production. A symptomatic lower UTI is assumed associated with more severe inflammation in the bladder compared to an ABU. Previous studies suggested that concentrations of IL-6 in the urine may be valuable in discriminating between ABU and UTI in the elderly, however, this needs evaluation in a larger study among the elderly.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^111vbV2Z]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Comparisons with other studies

Almost half of patients with an acute hospitalisation in this study had urine samples examined by a dipstick despite only about one-fourth of these presented with classic symptoms or findings of UTI. This suggests that dipsticks were used as a screening tool for UTI, which is in line with results from a previous meta-analysis and other studies. Moreover, the type of urine sample obtained for analysis was not described in 81% of cases. Similar to another study, these predominantly elderly, comorbid and acutely ill patients were usually not able to comply with the manufacturer's specifications for obtainment of clean midstream samples, and in-and-out catheterisation may not always be indicated or feasible. Incorrect urine sampling likely increased risks of contamination by inclusion of debris and bacteria from the urethra.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in 15–50% of elderly community dwellers or residents at long-term care facilities and is equally common among elderly patients hospitalised for non-infectious complaints or unspecific symptoms such as confusion, weakness or loss of autonomy. This was also observed in the current study with comparable prevalences of bacteriuria regardless of presence or absence of dementia, confusion, a history of fever or hospitalisation for medical conditions not related to the genitourinary tract (online supplemental table 3).

Consistent with other studies, the combination of absence-specific UTI symptoms, likely invalid urine sample and high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalised and predominantly elderly patients may have contributed to the observed poor performance of dipsticks for improving patient management in the current study. Despite a relatively high overall NPV of 95%, the post-test probabilities for UTI in symptomatic patients with negative dipsticks (12–27%) were unacceptably high and did not exclude UTI with reasonable certainty. Other studies found a higher diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for UTI, which may be due to differences in study populations (eg, restriction to young female adults presenting with specific UTI symptoms at the emergency department) or use of positive urine culture as gold standard (ie, bacteriuria) without specifically incorporating symptoms of UTI.

### Profile and prognosis of febrile elderly patients with bacteremic urinary tract infection [^1161NPf8]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the profile of elderly patients with bacteremic urinary tract infections (UTI) and correlate clinical and laboratory findings with the outcome in order to identify independent predictors of mortality.

Methods

This retrospective study took place in a large community-based, geriatric hospital and included 191 patients aged 75–105 years with urine and blood cultures simultaneously positive for bacterial organisms. Records were analysed for demographic information, clinical and laboratory data over a 29 month period. Mortality was assessed and was correlated with these findings.

Results

Most of the patients (80.1%) had community-acquired infection. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 87.6% of bacterial isolates, with Escherichia coli accounting for 46.1% of cases. Non-Escherichia coli Gram-negative organisms were highly resistant to two common urinary tract antibiotics (gentamicin and ceftriaxone). Patients with chronic urinary catheter had Gram-negative bacteria significantly less sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, ampicillin and ceftriaxon than patients without catheter (p < 0.05). In-hospital mortality was 33%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that mortality was significantly related to the number of underlying diagnoses (p < 0.0203), cognitive status (p < 0.0003), length of hospitalization (p < 0.0397), low level of serum albumin (p < 0.0021), high neutrophil count (p < 0.0001) and high level of lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0351). Fatality was not associated with advanced age in the very old.

Conclusion

Bacteremic UTI in the elderly has a high mortality rate. In frail elderly patients with age-associated multiple severe underlying disorders and cognitive impairment, early recognition of bacteremic UTI and prompt, appropriate treatment are critical in reducing the mortality.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1155AHnb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated febrile UTI were older and had multiple comorbidities. Especially in this population with the highest disease burden, in whom the longest antibiotic therapy is recommended by current guidelines, our algorithm proved to be effective.

The safety subgroups were small, but no trend for difference in rates of persistent infection was shown at 7 days after end of therapy or at 30 days after enrollment. The slightly higher, but non-significant, rate of bacteriuria and asymptomatic infection in the PCT-pyuria group should not be viewed as an unsuccessful treatment. There is vast evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated. In fact, asymptomatic bacteriuria might be protective against future development of pyelonephritis, as elegantly shown in a prospective Italian study of young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, who benefited from symptomatic treatment versus antibiotics. There is evidence that in older patients with isolated non-specific signs or non-infectious symptoms, such as delirium, urine testing and subsequent antibiotic therapy should not be ordered.

Furthermore, the follow-up mid-stream urine cultures in the PCT-pyuria group yielded in the majority of cases Enterococcus faecalis (Table 2), which has recently been shown to have a low positive predictive value for uropathogen growth in the bladder.

The antibiotics chosen in our algorithm, derived from international guidelines, should not deter from the necessity to adapt antibiotic choices to local epidemiology and resistance data. In Switzerland, 18.5% of Escherichia coli were resistant to fluoroquinolones in 2013, compared to 22.3% in the European Union in 2012.

A major strength was the innovative study design with antibiotic guidance based on the combination of the systemic and local response against a control group receiving antibiotic therapy according to the low end of currently recommended guidelines.

Potential limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, the small sample size due to slow recruitment and the heterogeneity of patients within the predefined subgroups limit the power of the analysis, especially regarding safety outcomes. Second, the follow-up mode by telephone interview and by urine samples which were returned by mail harbors potential recall bias and underreporting, which we tried to counteract by contacting the primary care physician and by obtaining discharge letters of subsequent hospitalizations. Third, the analysis of the recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients with bacteremia was limited due to the small numbers. Further studies will have to clarify whether this algorithm needs to be adapted for patients with bacteremia.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^112TPQWG]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

While the identification of risk factors helps clinicians to better assess the potential need for treatment, there still is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests differentiating ABU and UTI, especially in the geriatric population. This challenge could be overcome by improving the diagnosis of the inflammatory state of the urinary tract mucosa. Analysis of inflammation marker cytokine levels in urine was shown to be promising to distinguish ABU from upper urinary tract infections. Alternatively, the risk for a severe infection and the need for treatment could be predicted based on bacterial determinants. Several virulence factors in E. coli were earlier shown to be associated with pyelonephritis. Given the recent advances in molecular diagnostics, a rapid molecular diagnostic test detecting the presence of E. coli and its pathogenicity potential could help to decide whether to give antibiotics or not. After such treatment, the administration of avirulent ABU strains in a probiotic-like manner might reduce the risk of reinfection with the virulent strain and might prove a superior strategy compared to merely giving antibiotics alone.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^114ChW66]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this 68-hospital study of 11 590 hospitalized patients with ASB, 1.4% had bacteremia from a presumed urinary source and only 0.7% of patients with AMS and no systemic signs of infection did. No single risk factor conferred a 2% or greater risk of bacteremia. Specifically, older age, AMS, dementia, and change in urine character were not associated with bacteremia. These data reinforce prior evidence highlighting the poor yield of urine and blood cultures among hospitalized patients without systemic signs of infection and support not empirically treating patients with AMS and no systemic signs of infection.

Our study highlights that bacteremia in adult inpatients with ASB is rare, compared with estimates as high as in 24% to 56% in symptomatic patients. The probability of bacteremia varies widely based on individual risk factors, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. We found that the highest risk group had a 16.2% mean estimated probability of bacteremia as compared with 0.09% in the lowest risk group. Our study also adds data on laboratory markers that help identify patients at risk for bacteremia. Specifically, patients without specific signs or symptoms of UTI who developed bacteremia were twice as likely to have pyuria with 25 or greater WBCs on urinalysis and also more likely to have serum leukocytosis greater than 10 000/μL. Notably, no single characteristic conferred 2% or greater risk of bacteremia; rather, patients at elevated risk generally had multiple diagnostic findings, comorbidities, or symptoms.

### Effect of inpatient antibiotic treatment among older adults with delirium found with a positive urinalysis: a health record review [^1163byea]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a health record review of older adults admitted to hospital who had both evidence of delirium and a positive urinalysis at or near the time of admission. In this population, a large majority of the patients were treated with antibiotics. More than one third of the patients were asymptomatic other the inclusion criteria of delirium and positive urinalysis. Two thirds of this asymptomatic subgroup was still given antibiotic treatment. These results suggest that, in this inpatient setting, treatment for UTI is common in older adults with delirium even in the absence of urinary symptoms.

The tendency to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with delirium is consistent with findings of the recent Canadian survey of physicians by Laguë et al. The authors asked the respondents what the goals of antibiotic therapy were when treating bacteriuria in patients with delirium. "Infection treatment" was indicated by 83% and to "reduce the duration of delirium", by another 65%. These answers suggest that physicians are, at least partially, convinced that bacteriuria found in patients with delirium could constitute an infection and such treatment could hasten resolution of delirium. The study also found, "pressure from family or colleagues" as another reason for such treatment. In our study, we noted a higher antibiotic treatment rate among the less independent population (retirement home and long-term care). Ability to communicate their symptoms and increased number of comorbidities may be factors in antibiotic treatment.

We did not observe a difference in delirium resolution on the seventh day of admission between those who were treated with antibiotics compared to those given no antibiotics. However, it is difficult to draw a conclusion given the obvious difference in the two comparison groups in terms of number of asymptomatic patients: patients who received antibiotics often had non-UTI indications for antibiotic treatment such as pneumonia or sepsis, whereas those who did not receive antibiotics were largely asymptomatic. In the subgroup analysis of the asymptomatic cohort, we again failed to see evidence that antibiotic treatment influenced the delirium rate on the seventh day of admission. However, the small number of patients, especially in the non-antibiotic-treated group makes the point prevalence imprecise with a large confidence interval, thus making it difficult to draw any firm conclusion. We also did not see any evidence that antibiotic treatment in this population was associated with rates of mortality, C. difficile, ICU transfer or ALC.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^112WkYvB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most overdiagnosed infections, especially in hospitalized patients, older adults, and catheterized patients. Recent data show almost 50% of antibiotic prescriptions for outpatient UTIs are either inappropriate or unnecessary. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is even more common in hospitalized older adults and those presenting with dementia and/or altered mental status (AMS). AMS remains one of the primary indications for ASB treatment despite guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommending withholding antibiotic treatment in patients with ASB.

One reason for ASB overtreatment is clinicians' concern that poor outcomes (eg, bacteremia from UTI) may occur if antibiotics are not started early. Evidence to guide treatment in these situations are sparse. On the one hand, studies suggest antibiotic delays in patients with bacteremia or severe sepsis may increase mortality. In contrast, antibiotic treatment of ASB has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes and is instead associated with increased health care utilization, adverse drug events, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Prior studies have suggested that estimating a patient's risk of an outcome (eg, bacteremia) and then treating with antibiotic therapy if their risk exceeds 2% could balance potential under and overtreatment. However, there is no validated way to estimate the risk of bacteremia in a hospitalized patient with ASB.

We sought to (1) determine the prevalence of bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in a large, multihospital cohort of hospitalized patients with ASB and a subgroup of patients with AMS; (2) examine factors associated with bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in patients with ASB; and (3) estimate antibiotics avoided if a 2% risk of bacteremia were used as a threshold for empiric antibiotic treatment of ASB.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^1141TowA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to antimicrobial overuse in hospitalized patients. Indications for urine culture, treatment, and targets for improvement were evaluated in 153 patients. Drivers of antimicrobial overuse included fever with an alternative source, altered mental status, and leukocytosis, which led 435 excess days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Predictive factors of urinary tract infections among the oldest old in the general population. A population-based prospective follow-up study [^112Y2kmU]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The present study is a unique population-based sample of participants aged 86 years and over, with extensive baseline measurement and almost complete follow-up for morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine the incidence and predictive factors of UTI in a large group of unselected very old individuals in a population-based setting. It is important to study predictive factors of UTI in old age specifically, because they are the fastest growing part of the general population and the incidence of UTI increases with age. The fact that we only studied 86-year-olds could also be considered a limitation of our study. Since bladder structure and function, and the immune system have been shown to change with age, our results may not be generalized to younger elderly. Another limitation of our study might be that UTIs were diagnosed during clinical practice, not diagnosed by standardised diagnostic study procedures. In our study, however, all UTIs were diagnosed by general practitioners and elderly care physicians based on signs and symptoms and urine analysis. This procedure reflects usual care and enables generalisation of our results to daily care for the oldest old.

It is generally known that symptomatic UTI is over-diagnosed in elderly populations given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, especially in long-term care facilities with a prevalence of 25 to 50%. Also difficulties in communication, chronic genitourinary symptoms, and the high frequency of positive urine cultures, make ascertainment of symptomatic UTI problematic for the functionally impaired elderly. Also urine cultures are often contaminated and the lack of existence of specific markers of infectious bladder inflammation makes it difficult to diagnose UTI in impaired elderly. In our study, we found an UTI incidence of 11.2 per 100 person years at risk for persons aged 86 years and over. This may be an overestimation due to the presence of bacteriuria. However, the incidence found in this study is comparable with data from the Dutch national GP registration (11.7 for men and 29.4 for women aged 85 years and over) and the fact participants actively visited their treating physician with UTI like symptoms.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115Zs6K2]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria and central nervous involvement in typical hemolytic uremic syndrome: a case report [^1154u2rF]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a common subtype of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection is the most common cause of post-diarrheal HUS. Kidney and central nervous system are the primary target organs.

Case Presentation

A 64-year-old male presented with HUS following bloody diarrhea. Nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia were present at the acute stage and renal histology revealed common TMA features. Neurological involvement presented as confusion and impaired cognitive function. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral T2 hyperintensities in the brainstem and insula. The patient received plasma exchange and supportive care. Both the renal and neurological impairments were completely recovered 3 months after the onset.

Conclusion

We report an adult patient presenting with nephrotic-range proteinuria and central nervous system involvement at the acute phase of post-diarrheal HUS. The reversibility of the organ damages might predict a favorable outcome.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^1169osdk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This study is an exploratory analysis of an overarching, case-control study registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (NL9477). The study was conducted across 5 hospitals (4 regional and 1 academic), 4 long-term care facilities (LTCFs), 3 primary care centers, 1 after-hours primary care clinic, and 14 senior housing facilities. This study was approved by the regional medical ethics committee (Medisch-Ethische Toetsingscommissie Leiden Den Haag Delft) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Study Population

Women aged 65 years and older were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included inability to express symptoms (eg, due to delirium or cognitive impairment), the presence of an indwelling catheter, immunosuppressive use, antimicrobial use (< 48 hours prior to inclusion), current urolithiasis, and a UTI in the previous month. Stringent criteria were applied to both patients with UTI and control patients, as a consensus-based reference standard for UTI is currently missing. To be eligible for the UTI group, patients were required to have at least 2 new-onset LUTS (dysuria, frequency, urgency, or suprapubic pain). Furthermore, patients were required to have pyuria, defined as 10 or more leukocytes/µL or 5 or more leukocytes/hpf or the presence of leukocyte esterase, and a monoculture (ie, 1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL), for the primary analysis. Enterobacterales, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and group B streptococci were considered uropathogens. In case of a temperature of 38.0°C or higher, patients were classified as having an upper UTI. Community-dwelling women and LTCF residents who did not have any LUTS or fever were eligible as controls. Patients were eligible regardless of urine culture results and they were subdivided into 3 subgroups: ASB, negative culture, and mixed flora. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as at least 2 consecutive urine cultures (2–4 weeks apart) with the same uropathogen with 10⁵ CFU/mL or greater, and a negative culture was defined as no growth or growth of nonpathogenic micro-organisms with 10³ CFU/mL or less. Cases and controls were not matched for age or comorbidities.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114fWK1J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) with impaired voiding — asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) management: Recommendation — In patients with SCI, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary highlights that subjects with SCI have a high prevalence of bacteriuria and a high incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and treatment of ASB is usually followed by early recurrence of bacteriuria with reinfecting strains more likely to be antimicrobial resistant. Trials in intermittently catheterized patients observed no differences in rates of symptomatic UTI between antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment. Multiple reviews and guidelines concluded that ASB should not be screened for or treated in SCI patients, and European Association of Urology guidance states screening for and treatment of ASB are not recommended. Some evidence suggests ASB might be protective and that treatment of ASB may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI; bacterial interference using nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli 83972/HU2117) has been evaluated, with two RCTs in neurogenic bladders reporting protection against symptomatic UTI in small cohorts (20 and 27 patients, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms of UTI in SCI may differ from the classic genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with normal sensation.

### Bacteruria and urinary tract infections in the elderly [^11157c17]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Both urinary tract infection (UTI) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) are common problems among elderly adults and represent a significant health care burden. Despite their frequency, differentiating between ASB and true UTI remains controversial among health care providers. Several challenges exist in the evaluation of urinary symptoms in the elderly patient. Symptoms of UTI are variable; problems are encountered in the collection, testing, and interpretation of urine specimens; and results of urinalysis are often misinterpreted and mishandled. Multiple studies have shown no morbidity or mortality benefit to antibiotic therapy in either community or long-term care facility residents with ASB.

### An implementation guide to reducing overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115ggoQL]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asymptomatic bacteriuria:

- **Definition**: ASB is defined as the presence of bacteria in an uncontamined urine sample at a microbial load of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, without any associated signs or symptoms of UTI.
- **Pathophysiology**: ASB is most frequently caused by E. coli, followed by P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus species, S. aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ASB is 1–2% in healthy men, 1–9% in healthy women, 2–15% in pregnant women, 1–30% in diabetic adults, 2–50% in community-dwelling adults, 14–75% in institutionalized adults, and 9–100% in patients with indwelling catheters.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ASB include female sex, advancing age, the use of indwelling catheters, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, glucosuria, a history of UTIs, prostatic obstruction, neurological disorders, inadequate peri-anal hygiene, insufficient fluid intake, and overactive bladder syndrome.
- **Disease course**: In patients with ASB, symptoms of UTI are absent for a variety of reasons, including attenuated host immune response, as well as reduced microbial virulence, growth rates, and cell densities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment of ASB should be avoided in low-risk populations given the absence of demonstrated benefit, potential for adverse drug reactions, and risk of promoting antibiotic-resistance. Select patients who may derive benefit from treatment include pregnant women and patients undergoing certain invasive procedures.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^111cNbN7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and is classically described as urinary symptoms associated with a positive urine culture. Symptoms of UTI can vary widely but often include dysuria, increased frequency, urgency of urination, and lower abdominal pain. However the diagnosis of UTI in older adults is challenging due to atypical or subtle symptoms and frequent cognitive impairment. In addition, urine cultures are often positive due to the high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, further complicating the diagnosis. Urine dipsticks, commonly used as a preliminary diagnostic tool, provide a rapid and non-invasive method of testing for UTIs by detecting the presence of leukocytes and nitrites in the urine. While urine dipsticks give good results in young patients, they may not be able to accurately identify UTIs in older patients. This inadequacy is probably due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria combined with the fact that the leukocyturia thresholds used to guide the diagnosis of UTIs are based on younger populations and may not be appropriate for older people. Automated urine flow cytometers provide rapid and accurate counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, bacteria and epithelial cells in urine samples. As urine culture is time-consuming and does not aid the diagnosis of UTI in the emergency setting, several studies have established specific thresholds or scoring systems using these automated results to detect UTI or positive urine cultures. However, these studies have primarily focused on younger adults, limiting their relevance to older patients.

Given these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop diagnostic criteria applicable to the older adults. This study proposes to investigate older patients admitted to the hospital with a urine culture obtained in the emergency department. The primary objective was to evaluate the flow cytometry parameters for the diagnosis of UTI in older patients and compare them with the performance of the urine dipstick. We also aimed to evaluate the association of biological parameters and clinical symptoms to exclude or diagnose UTI before urine culture results.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116qAzrp]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In LTCFs, antimicrobial use for UTI is high and often the result of a misdiagnosis of ABU as UTI. Differentiating between ABU and UTI in this population is challenging. Identifying subpopulations with low or high risks for asymptomatic bacteriuria could help to guide the decision to initiate or withhold antibiotic therapy. In this study, we showed that female participants with urinary incontinence or assigned to BES group Cd had ABU prevalence rates of 80 to 90%. Vague UTI symptoms and positive urine cultures in these populations should be interpreted with care to avoid adverse effects of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, ABU prevalence rates were relatively low (10 to 15%) among institutionalized older adults without incontinence, of male gender or categorized into BES group O. In these subgroups, vague signs of a UTI combined with positive urine cultures are more likely to predict a true infection. Our study thus demonstrates that due to the high prevalence of ABU, the frailest population is at the highest risk of unnecessary treatment. Such knowledge should be more actively used when considering treatment strategies for the older adults. In the future, molecular diagnostics predicting bacterial pathogenicity or host susceptibility could help to identify those persons at risk of infection and requiring treatment.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LV38Z]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Evidence from included studies suggests that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally thought to be associated with UTI, may be of limited diagnostic value in older adults. This review highlights the complexity of diagnosing UTI in older adults, and the breadth of their clinical presentations. The results of this review are based on evidence from studies of variable quality and therefore should be treated with caution. Further high quality studies, with large numbers of participants, need to be performed to corroborate these findings. This would assist clinicians with prompt and accurate diagnosis of true UTI, encouraging appropriate treatment with antimicrobials. Clarity in this area may also help clinicians to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for the latter condition, thereby improving antimicrobial stewardship. It is unclear how application of information from this review might translate into improved diagnostic rates of UTI in older adults or improve appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^114UFNqx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), cognitive impairment, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) complicate the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in older women. The presence of pyuria remains the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. However, > 90% of ASB patients have pyuria, prompting unnecessary treatment. We quantified pyuria by automated microscopy and flowcytometry to determine the diagnostic accuracy for UTI and to derive pyuria thresholds for UTI in older women.

Methods

Women ≥ 65 years with ≥ 2 new-onset LUTS and 1 uropathogen ≥ 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were included in the UTI group. Controls were asymptomatic and classified as ASB (1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL), negative culture, or mixed flora. Patients with an indwelling catheter or antimicrobial pretreatment were excluded. Leukocyte medians were compared and sensitivity-specificity pairs were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

We included 164 participants. UTI patients had higher median urinary leukocytes compared with control patients (microscopy: 900 vs 26 leukocytes/µL; flowcytometry: 1575 vs 23 leukocytes/µL; P < .001). Area under the curve was 0.93 for both methods. At a cutoff of 264 leukocytes/µL, sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 88% (positive and negative likelihood ratio: 7.2 and 0.1, respectively). The commonly used cutoff of 10 leukocytes/µL had a poor specificity (36%) and a sensitivity of 100%.

Conclusions

The degree of pyuria can help to distinguish UTI in older women from ASB and asymptomatic controls with pyuria. Current pyuria cutoffs are too low and promote inappropriate UTI diagnosis in older women. Clinical Trials Registration.

### Urine cultures in a long-term care facility (LTCF): time for improvement [^11157nHV]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study described the reasons for obtaining urine cultures and the actions taken based on the urine culture results in a LTCF.

In residents treated empirically with ABs for suspected UTIs, urine cultures were obtained in 8% of residents. In those cases in which the culture results suggested a reason for action, actions were taken in only 25%. The main reasons for ordering a urine culture were to confirm the diagnosis of a UTI, to determine the resistance of the isolated uropathogens or to rule out a UTI.

Several resident-related factors, diagnostic uncertainties and logistic problems might influence the diagnosis of a putative UTI and the decision regarding whether or not to take action according to culture results.

First, the infection might have been self-limiting, and complaints may have disappeared spontaneously or were no longer considered to be related to a UTI. In these situations, an initiation of or change in AB treatment are deemed unnecessary. We assume that if complaints remained at the time the culture results were reported, the nurses would have brought this issue to the attention of the responsible physician, and active follow-up would have been documented in the residents' medical records.

Second, the high prevalence of ASB in LTCF residents and the non-specific signs and symptoms unrelated to UTIs, such as restlessness, aggression, 'not being him or herself' and drowsiness, are often considered to be falsely related to UTIs. This finding is especially a problem in psychogeriatric care settings in which residents cannot always communicate their complaints properly. In patients with dementia, behavioural problems have a fluctuating pattern during the course of the disease. If physicians are convinced that behavioural problems in combination with ASB are caused by a UTI, AB treatment will be administered. Due to the fluctuating pattern of these behavioural problems, the symptoms often disappear spontaneously, suggesting that AB treatment was effective; this result might lead physicians to respond in the same manner in similar situations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Tn8oB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in children — evidence and research needs: In girls with ASB, symptomatic reinfections after therapy occurred in 7 of 46 (15%), all with new E. coli strains isolated, whereas bacteriuria persisted in all girls treated with erythromycin and none developed symptomatic infection following antimicrobial therapy. Screening modeling projected substantial test burden and cost: screening of 100 000 hypothetical preschool children using standard culture techniques would result in nearly 20 000 false-positive tests and 143 false negatives, with total costs estimated at nearly $2 million dollars in 1992. The rationale states there is moderate-quality evidence that there is no benefit and high-quality evidence of harm; ASB is uncommon in infants and boys and occurs in about 1%–3% of healthy girls; there is no evidence of a higher risk for subsequent renal scarring or renal insufficiency; and there is no evidence that treatment prevents symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, renal scarring, or renal insufficiency. It also notes studies addressing ASB in children were performed > 40 years ago without indications that incidence or outcomes would differ today, and identifies research needs: future studies of antimicrobial therapy should include renal scarring as a primary outcome, and studies enrolling children with neuromuscular disorders and immunocompromised states should be a priority.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, antibiotic use, and suspected urinary tract infections in four nursing homes [^1176NqWJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Independent variables

Resident characteristics were obtained using a resident's admission MDS (version 2.0) and the most recent MDS completed prior to the date of the first suspected UTI. Information on physical functioning and cognitive patterns were used to construct established scales for activities of daily living and cognitive performance. Our model also included an indicator for potential depression, and an indicator of the presence of a problem or condition that might result relatively soon in a health decline or in death.

We investigated the effects of individual health status measures on the likelihood a prescription would be written for ASB. Although the results of previous research on the impact of functional status or case-mix on certain aspects of antibiotic use is somewhat mixed, we included a measure of functional status in our analyses. The ADL Hierarchy Scale uses residents' performance in activities of daily living to group them according to stages in the disablement process (range from 0 to 6). Higher scores indicate greater needs for assistance to overcome activity limitations. The Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) combines information on memory impairment, communication problems, executive function, and independence in daily decision making. The scores range from 0 (intact) to 6 (very severe impairment). Previous research has shown that the CPS is highly correlated with the Mini-Mental Status Examination and has been used extensively for over a decade of research in nursing homes. Behavioral and cognitive symptoms of depression may overlap with those of delirium in the elderly, increasing the challenge of diagnosing symptomatic UTIs. As an indicator of potential depression symptoms, we used items from the MDS Depression Rating Scale (DRS). The original DRS consists of seven items generating a score ranging from 0 (depression not exhibited) to 14 (depression exhibited daily). In our sample, the prevalence of the symptoms included in the DRS was relatively low. This made it impossible to create a full DRS with a reasonable distribution. Instead we used the DRS variables to create a dichotomous variable – the depression item - representing the presence or absence of any symptoms of depression.

### Risk factors for the development of acute pyelonephritis in women with a positive urine culture [^1116FSDQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the risk of overtreatment with antibiotics must be reconciled with the risk of an untreated urinary tract infection (UTI) progressing to acute pyelonephritis (APN). Using Cerner HealthFacts, a longitudinal clinical informatics database, we aimed to determine risk factors associated with the development of APN from UTI in an effort to guide the initiation of empiric antibiotics.

Methods

We queried the Cerner HealthFacts database for women over age 18 with a positive urine culture. Any patient with an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code indicating chronic pyelonephritis was excluded. Development of APN within 30 days of the positive culture, specified by ICD coding, was our primary outcome. Patient and facility factors were assessed as potential risk factors for the development of APN using multivariable regression.

Results

Out of 58344 women with a positive urine culture, 3.9% (2296) developed APN. Mean patient age was 54.4 ± 25.3 years. Overall, 12 variables were predictive for APN and 11 variables were protective against APN. Presence of obstructive and reflux uropathies (OR 4.58), presentation to an acute care facility (OR 3.19), urinary retention (OR 2.30), history of UTI (OR 2.19), and renal comorbidities (OR 2.07) conferred the highest odds of APN development. The most protective variable against APN development was cognitive impairment (OR 0.49).

Conclusions

Identified risk factors associated with APN development may aid decisions regarding empiric antibiotic initiation for patients presenting with LUTS while awaiting urine culture results. The relationship between cognitive impairment and progression to APN deserves further study.

Human as habitat model — lower urinary tract microbiome and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) reframe culture interpretation and clinical outcomes. Sensitive culture-dependent and -independent techniques reveal that the lower urinary tract, even in asymptomatic, healthy individuals, hosts a complex microbial community, challenging the prior view that urine is sterile and redefining UTI as microbial infiltration of an otherwise sterile tract; in this view all individuals are likely "bacteriuric", these commensal communities are generally symbiotic, and ASB communities may protect patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) from additional symptomatic episodes. Among 673 young women with ASB, those treated with antibiotics experienced higher rates of subsequent symptomatic UTI, intentional bladder colonization with a nonpathogenic E. coli (HU2117) has been shown to safely reduce symptomatic UTI risk in patients with spinal cord injury, and large epidemiologic studies document a high prevalence (> 75%) of chronic or fluctuating lower urinary tract symptoms in the general population.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116KXkdL]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of these ambiguities, understanding which residents are prone to develop ABU is important and can help physicians to guide antibiotic treatment. While urine cultures from subjects with a high risk of having ABU should be interpreted with care, urine cultures from low-risk groups have a higher diagnostic value. Older studies identified age, incontinence, functional disability, mental status and mobility as risk factors that are associated with an increased chance of having ABU. Although there are discrepancies between these studies, in general, more frail subjects have a higher risk of ABU. Longitudinal studies in the older adults report that the overall prevalence of ABU is rather static, but with high turnover rates, and conclude that ABU is a rather transient phenomenon with only a minority of people presenting with persistent colonization.

In this study, we identified prevalence rates, causal species and risk factors associated with ABU and long-term ABU in a LTCF. In addition, we recorded UTI episodes of all participants during the study period and 6 months following the last sample collection to investigate a possible preventive effect of ABU on UTI occurrences. A policy of the LTCF to avoid the prophylactic use of antibiotics allowed to evaluate the occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria with only few participants excluded due to antibiotic interference.

From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

Results

Patient inclusion

For the 6-month period, 462 patients were prospectively included. Eighty-one patients were eligible for the UTI group based on the clinician's diagnosis and treatment decision during their hospital stay. Of these, 60 patients met our criteria for a diagnosis of UTI (Fig. 1). The review of the 21 medical records by the 2 physicians led to the classification of 9 patients as having a UTI, 6 patients as having urinary tract colonisation and 6 patients as being excluded because it was impossible to reach a conclusion. Consequently, a total of 69 patients with UTI were considered for further analysis, alongside 387 control group patients. Patient age, number of prescribed medications, Charlson comorbidity score, and hospital setting were not significantly different between the UTI and control groups. The male/female ratio was different, with more males in the control group (n = 200; 51.7%) than in the UTI group (n = 23; 33.3%) (p < 0.01). Demographic data are shown in Table 1. Diagnoses made in the emergency department are available in Table S2.

Culture results

Of the 69 UTI cases, 97.1% had positive cultures, while two cultures were considered contaminated. In contrast, the control group had 25.8% positive cultures, 42.9% negative cultures, and 31.3% contaminated cultures. Enterobacterales were predominant in both groups, found in 91.9% of UTI cases (n = 68) and 79.8% of control samples (n = 87). Escherichia coli was the most common species in the UTI group (n = 49; 66.2%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (n = 9; 12.2%) and Proteus spp. (n = 6; 8.1%). Similarly, E. coli (n = 71; 64.45%), Klebsiella spp. (n = 9; 8.26%), and Enterococcus spp. (n = 9; 8.26%) were the main species in the control group (Table S3).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

A nursing home resident in her 80s has a history of falls, cognitive impairment, and incontinence. In the past 2 years, she was thought to have a urinary tract infection on 8 occasions and received antibiotic therapy 6 times. Symptoms that triggered an evaluation for UTI included increased confusion, urinary frequency, cloudy urine, lethargy, hallucinations, and falls. On this occasion, the family reports that she "doesn't look right, " but the nursing staff states she is not confused. The patient reports no dysuria or abdominal pain but does chronically complain of voiding frequently. She is afebrile with no abdominal, suprapubic, or flank tenderness, but her urine has a foul odor. A catheterized urine specimen is obtained and results of urinalysis are reported. The urine culture reveals more than 100 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of Escherichia coli, which is sensitive to all antibiotics except ampicillin.

If the laboratory cannot clarify the culture count and cannot say for certain that a culture has at least 100, 000 CFU/ml, do not use that culture for NHSN UTI surveillance. Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus species is as far as you can get for reporting purposes. The E. coli #1 and E. coli #2 is considered one organism, and then S. aureus would be considered the second organism. Antimicrobial susceptibility results and colony morphology difference do not equate to a report of separate organisms. This urine culture result is not > 2 organisms, and therefore, is an eligible specimen. 40, 000–50, 000 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca > 100, 000 CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa < 10, 000 CFU/ml Candida, not albicans No, the urine culture would be ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because there would be a total of three organisms present, including the candida.

An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. The purpose of submitting a urine specimen for culture is to determine infection. The NHSN definitions currently account for contamination of urine specimens. NSHN excludes specimens with culture results of more than two organisms for use in meeting UTI definitions. Neobladders and CAUTIs Yes. Patients who have neobladders are not excluded from CAUTI surveillance. NHSN surveillance definitions account for contamination. Urine cultures that result with > 2 eligible organisms, are not eligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria. Secondary BSI and associated urine colony count No. Only the E. coli has a colony count eligible for use in meeting a UTI criteria. Scenario 1 of the Secondary BSI guide states: At least one organism from the blood specimen must match an organism identified from the site-specific infection, in this case the urine, that is used as an element to meet the NHSN site-specific infection criterion.
