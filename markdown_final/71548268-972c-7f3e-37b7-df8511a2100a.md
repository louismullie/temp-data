## Question

What are the symptoms of zinc deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of zinc deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how zinc deficiency presents across severities and populations. Then, I should verify the hallmark dermatologic features and their distribution. Next, I will review gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, immune, growth, and reproductive manifestations. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts where symptoms may differ. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, organ-system–based symptom profile and note diagnostic caveats and when to suspect zinc deficiency clinically.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and spectrum. Zinc deficiency spans mild, moderate, and severe forms, with symptoms reflecting impaired enzymatic, structural, and signaling roles across multiple organ systems; the most severe manifestation is acrodermatitis enteropathica, which can be congenital or acquired, and symptoms generally emerge after about three months of sustained low zinc status, though this timeline varies with age and reserves [^40e959ed] [^86b19fcc].

> I will now examine the dermatologic hallmark, because that is often the most visible clue. Wait, let me verify the classic distribution: periorificial and acral dermatitis with sharply demarcated, erythematous, scaly or erosive plaques around the mouth, eyes, nose, anus, and on hands and feet is characteristic; alopecia and nail dystrophy frequently accompany this, and in infants these lesions can resemble burn injuries, which can be misleading if one does not consider zinc deficiency early [^183c65be] [^b4bab3d6] [^537494af].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal symptoms. Diarrhea is a core feature in moderate to severe deficiency, often chronic or persistent, and zinc deficiency is a recognized contributor to diarrheal disease burden globally; importantly, zinc supplementation shortens diarrheal duration in children older than six months in high-risk settings, reinforcing the causal link and the clinical salience of this symptom [^68d0dae8] [^0c8288c1] [^763e1459].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neuropsychiatric features; I need to check the strength of evidence. Taste disturbance (dysgeusia or hypogeusia) and smell alterations are well-described, and zinc supplementation can improve taste acuity in zinc-deficient individuals, though data are heterogeneous; mood symptoms, including depression, have been linked to low serum zinc in inflammatory bowel disease cohorts, but causality remains uncertain and supplementation effects are not firmly established in humans outside specific contexts [^64e53e97] [^13465616] [^b3643963].

> I should confirm immune and infection-related manifestations. Zinc deficiency impairs both innate and adaptive immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections, and in children it contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality from diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria; clinically, recurrent or severe infections, poor wound healing, and delayed recovery should raise suspicion, particularly in high-risk populations [^61de0b40] [^2118d28b] [^9be072bb].

> Let me consider growth and development next. Growth retardation, failure to thrive, and delayed sexual maturation are classic in children with chronic zinc deficiency; in preterm and low-birth-weight infants, transient symptomatic zinc deficiency can present with periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and poor growth, resolving with zinc repletion and often correlating with low serum zinc despite normal maternal milk zinc [^68d0dae8] [^2fecd369] [^40e959ed].

> I should double-check reproductive and endocrine features. Hypogonadism, delayed puberty, and impaired fertility have been described, particularly in males with chronic zinc deficiency; these features align with zinc's roles in gonadal function and sex hormone physiology, though they are less specific and often co-present with other systemic signs [^68d0dae8] [^183c65be].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where the phenotype shifts. In liver disease, especially cirrhosis, zinc deficiency is highly prevalent and contributes to encephalopathy, night vision impairment, anorexia, altered taste, hypogonadism, poor wound healing, and immune dysfunction; guidelines recommend considering zinc supplementation when hypozincemia or compatible symptoms are present, which underscores the need to actively look for these features in cirrhosis care [^a31114ab] [^2fe096c5] [^397f227f].

> In bariatric surgery, I need to ensure I account for malabsorption and bypass of absorptive segments. Zinc deficiency is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion, presenting with hair loss, acrodermatitis enteropathica–like rash, taste changes, glossitis, and poor wound healing; guidelines advise annual screening with serum or plasma zinc in at-risk procedures and supplementation when indicated, and case reports show that IV zinc may be required when oral therapy fails due to malabsorption [^a9ce6069] [^353ffdf6] [^8a5d1f29].

> In infants and children, let me reconsider the timing and severity. Transient symptomatic zinc deficiency in preterm or exclusively breastfed infants can mimic acrodermatitis enteropathica, with periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, and growth impairment; recognition is critical because symptoms resolve with zinc therapy and may recur if supplementation is withdrawn prematurely, so longitudinal follow-up and, when available, SLC39A4 testing help distinguish this from genetic AE [^2fecd369] [^e6a7f96d] [^ef8c63b2].

> I should also review iatrogenic and nutritional contexts. Total parenteral nutrition without adequate zinc can precipitate deficiency with diarrhea, apathy, dermatitis, and alopecia; FDA labeling for parenteral zinc emphasizes monitoring and prevention of deficiency, and shortages of injectable zinc have led to documented outbreaks of severe deficiency in vulnerable infants, highlighting the need for vigilance in PN-dependent patients [^d8cae340] [^537494af] [^faec4ae9].

> Next, I should review diagnostic caveats so I do not overcall deficiency based on a single low zinc level. Plasma zinc is a useful screening tool but is confounded by inflammation, infection, stress, and albumin status; clinical correlation and, when uncertain, a therapeutic trial of zinc with clinical response are reasonable strategies, especially when the phenotype is compelling [^34e35948] [^183c65be].

> Let me synthesize a practical, organ-system–based symptom profile. Dermatologic: periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, nail dystrophy, poor wound healing; gastrointestinal: chronic diarrhea, especially persistent or recurrent; neuropsychiatric: dysgeusia, hyposmia, anorexia, irritability, depression in select contexts; immune: recurrent infections, impaired wound healing; growth: failure to thrive, growth retardation, delayed puberty; reproductive: hypogonadism, impaired fertility; ocular: in severe cases, Bitot spots from secondary vitamin A dysregulation; hematologic: anemia can occur with chronic deficiency or secondary to copper deficiency from excess zinc [^183c65be] [^8397da3c] [^68d0dae8].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are actionable. Suspect zinc deficiency when the triad of dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea coexists, but remember that only about 20% of cases show all three; maintain a high index of suspicion in malnutrition, malabsorption, liver disease, bariatric surgery, TPN, and preterm infants; and consider a therapeutic trial when labs are equivocal but the phenotype is classic, monitoring for clinical response and watching for copper deficiency with prolonged high-dose zinc [^e6a7f96d] [^183c65be] [^7c6354ea].

Zinc deficiency presents with **periorificial and acral dermatitis** (often erosive or vesicular), **alopecia**, and **diarrhea** as the classic triad, especially in severe or inherited forms [^b4bab3d6] [^183c65be]. Additional features include **growth retardation**, **impaired wound healing**, **hypogeusia/dysgeusia**, **immunosuppression** with recurrent infections, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as irritability, depression, and cognitive impairment [^68d0dae8] [^d56dfd8c]. In infants and children, symptoms may also include failure to thrive, developmental delay, and behavioral changes [^40e959ed]. Severity and manifestations vary with age, underlying causes, and duration of deficiency [^183c65be].

---

## Dermatological symptoms

- **Periorificial and acral dermatitis**: Characteristic erosive, vesicular, or scaly plaques around the mouth, eyes, nose, anus, and on hands and feet; often sharply demarcated and symmetric [^b4bab3d6] [^183c65be].

- **Alopecia**: Hair loss ranging from diffuse thinning to total alopecia, including eyebrows and eyelashes [^b4bab3d6].

- **Impaired wound healing**: Delayed or poor healing of cuts, abrasions, or surgical wounds due to impaired epithelial proliferation and collagen synthesis [^68d0dae8].

- **Nail dystrophy**: Beau's lines, ridging, or onycholysis [^notfound].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Diarrhea is common — often chronic or persistent — and reflects **impaired intestinal mucosal integrity and immune dysfunction** [^68d0dae8] [^35381c3a]. Anorexia and nausea may occur, contributing to **weight loss and malnutrition** [^notfound].

---

## Growth and developmental symptoms

Growth retardation manifests as **impaired linear growth and delayed skeletal maturation**, particularly in children and adolescents [^68d0dae8]. Delayed sexual maturation presents as **hypogonadism**, delayed puberty, and impaired reproductive function, especially in males [^68d0dae8].

---

## Neurological and psychiatric symptoms

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Irritability, depression, cognitive impairment, and behavioral disturbances [^notfound].

- **Sensory disturbances**: Hypogeusia (reduced taste), dysgeusia (distorted taste), and anosmia (loss of smell) [^d8cae340].

---

## Immunological symptoms

Immunosuppression manifests as **increased susceptibility to infections**, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin infections, due to impaired T-cell and B-cell function [^35381c3a] [^2118d28b].

---

## Ocular symptoms

Ocular involvement may present as **conjunctivitis**, **blepharitis**, corneal opacities, and photophobia, particularly in severe or inherited forms [^e6a7f96d].

## Summary of key symptoms

- **Dermatological**: Periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, impaired wound healing, nail dystrophy [^b4bab3d6] [^183c65be].

- **Gastrointestinal**: Diarrhea, anorexia, nausea [^68d0dae8].

- **Growth and developmental**: Growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, failure to thrive [^68d0dae8].

- **Neurological and psychiatric**: Irritability, depression, cognitive impairment, hypogeusia, dysgeusia, anosmia [^d8cae340].

- **Immunological**: Increased susceptibility to infections [^35381c3a].

- **Ocular**: Conjunctivitis, blepharitis, corneal opacities, photophobia [^e6a7f96d].

---

Zinc deficiency has a broad clinical spectrum, with **dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea** as the classic triad, alongside growth impairment, immune dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recognition depends on clinical context, risk factors, and supportive labs, and **prompt zinc repletion** typically reverses most manifestations.

Zinc is a trace element essential to the gastrointestinal, immune, integumentary, reproductive, and central nervous systems. Zinc deficiency is prevalent in many areas of the world and is a diagnostically challenging condition. Cutaneous manifestations typically occur in moderate to severe zinc deficiency and present as alopecia and dermatitis in the perioral, acral, and perineal regions. Zinc deficiency is a potentially fatal disease process. The aim of this review is to focus on the cutaneous manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of zinc deficiency in children, and to propose an etiologic classification system.

Selenium and zinc in CKD — implementation, monitoring, and research priorities are outlined. Suggested intake should be based on recommendations for the general population unless specific considerations require modification. There are no specific guidelines for monitoring selenium and zinc deficiency or supplementation, though practitioners should be aware of signs and symptoms of severe deficiency in patients with stages 3-5D CKD. Research recommendations include evaluating biochemical testing and thresholds to define deficiency and applicability of general-population thresholds; conducting population-based cohort studies across CKD, kidney transplant recipients, and dialysis modalities to relate deficiency to surrogate and hard outcomes; and conducting adequately powered clinical trials to assess whether supplementation in deficient patients improves inflammation, PEW, lipids, wound healing, dysgeusia, and other outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Limited data suggest further randomized trials should recruit specifically selenium-deficient patients, and the safety of prescribing zinc in nondeficient dialysis patients also needs to be determined.

### Zinc deficiency [^35381c3a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Zinc plays an essential role in numerous biochemical pathways. Zinc deficiency affects many organ systems, including the integumentary, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, immune, skeletal, and reproductive systems. This article aims to discuss zinc metabolism and highlights a few of the diseases associated with zinc deficiency.

Recent Findings

Zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and increases the susceptibility to infection. Supplementation of zinc has been shown to reduce the incidence of infection as well as cellular damage from increased oxidative stress. Zinc deficiency is also associated with acute and chronic liver disease. Zinc supplementation protects against toxin-induced liver damage and is used as a therapy for hepatic encephalopathy in patients refractory to standard treatment. Zinc deficiency has also been implicated in diarrheal disease, and supplementation has been effective in both prophylaxis and treatment of acute diarrhea.

Summary

This article is not meant to review all of the disease states associated with zinc deficiency. Rather, it is an introduction to the influence of the many roles of zinc in the body, with an extensive discussion of the influence of zinc deficiency in selected diseases. Zinc supplementation may be beneficial as an adjunct to treatment of many disease states.

### Zinc: an essential micronutrient [^68d0dae8]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding, and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes are at an increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory infection and diarrhea, and as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc in combination with antioxidants may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of intermediate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson disease. Current data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended dosages. Adverse effects of long-term high-dose zinc use include suppressed immunity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

### Zinc deficiency in children with environmental enteropathy-development of new strategies: report from an expert workshop [^c1e0f113]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The WHO/UNICEF strategy for zinc supplementation as adjunctive therapy for diarrhea is poorly implemented. A conference of experts in zinc nutrition and gastrointestinal disorders was convened to consider approaches that might complement the current recommendation and what research was needed to develop these approaches. Several key points were identified. The design of novel zinc interventions would be facilitated by a better understanding of how disturbed gut function, such as environmental (or tropical) enteropathy, affects zinc absorption, losses, and homeostasis. Because only 10% of zinc stores are able to be rapidly turned over, and appear to be rapidly depleted by acute intestinal illness, they are probably best maintained by complementary regular supplementation in a primary prevention strategy rather than secondary prevention triggered by acute diarrhea. The assessment of zinc status is challenging and complex without simple, validated measures to facilitate field testing of novel interventions. Zinc bioavailability may be a crucial factor in the success of primary prevention strategies, and a range of options, all still inadequately explored, might be valuable in improving zinc nutrition. Some therapeutic actions of zinc on diarrhea seem attributable to pharmacologic effects, whereas others are related to the reversal of deficiency (ie, nutritional). The distinction between these 2 mechanisms cannot be clarified given the insensitivity of serum zinc to identify subclinical deficiency states. Why zinc seems to be less effective than expected at all ages, and ineffective for secondary prevention of diarrhea in children < 12 mo of age, remains unclear. It was concluded that a reframing of the current recommendation is warranted with consideration of how to better optimize and deliver zinc and whether to provide a complementary public health primary prevention zinc strategy. This requires careful consideration of the zinc product to be used as well as strategies for its delivery.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^0c8288c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using either a fixed-effect or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency. Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well-conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence). In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD -11.46 hours, 95% CI -19.72 to -3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD -26.39 hours, 95% CI -36.54 to -16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence). Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, moderate certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence). Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well-nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of zinc deficiency. The genetic defect has been mapped to 8q24 and the defective gene identified as SLC39A4, which encodes the zinc transporter Zip4. The diagnosis is made by way of clinical presentation together with histopathology and laboratory tests. Here we provide an overview of zinc metabolism and a description of inherited and acquired zinc deficiency.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^ca1fbfff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around two million child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

In February 2012, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. Diarrhoea duration and severity were the primary outcomes. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using the fixed- or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. The quality of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE methods

Main Results

Twenty-four trials, enrolling 9128 children, met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the data is from Asia, from countries at high risk of zinc deficiency, and may not be applicable elsewhere. Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well conducted randomized controlled trials to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or hospitalization (very low quality evidence). In children aged greater than six months with acute diarrhoea, zinc supplementation may shorten the duration of diarrhoea by around 10 hours (MD -10.44 hours, 95% CI -21.13 to 0.25; 2091 children, five trials, low quality evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, six trials, moderate quality evidence). In children with signs of moderate malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around 27 hours (MD -26.98 hours, 95% CI -14.62 to -39.34; 336 children, three trials, high quality evidence). Conversely, In children aged less than six months, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on mean diarrhoea duration (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, two trials, low quality evidence), and may even increase the proportion of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, one trial, moderate quality evidence). No trials reported serious adverse events, but zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea causes vomiting in both age groups (RR 1.59, 95% 1.27 to 1.99; 5189 children, 10 trials, high quality evidence). Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, five trials, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of moderate malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children below six months of age.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, m RCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data collection and analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses (using either a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

Thirty‐three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency.

Acute diarrhoea

There is currently not enough evidence from well‐conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence).

In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD −11.46 hours, 95% CI −19.72 to −3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD −26.39 hours, 95% CI −36.54 to −16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence).

Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI −4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, low certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, low certainty evidence).

None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Persistent diarrhoea

In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD −15.84 hours, 95% CI −25.43 to −6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well‐nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^d56dfd8c]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Zinc — sources, deficiency signs, and toxicity are outlined as follows: sources include meat, liver, eggs, and seafood (especially oysters); deficiency features include impaired wound healing and blunting of taste and smell; toxicity includes acute gastrointestinal symptoms at high intake and metabolic effects. Acute (> 200 mg daily): nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea; excess zinc decreases HDL cholesterol and is associated with impaired immune function.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^cd027eef]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — probiotics and zinc recommendations — Probiotic preparations may be offered to reduce the symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent adults and children with infectious or antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (weak, moderate), and specific recommendations regarding selection of organism(s), route, and dosage may be found through literature and manufacturer guidance. Oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years of age who reside in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition (strong, moderate). Meta-analyses report probiotics reduced mean duration of diarrhea by 25 hours (95% confidence interval, 16–34 hours), reduced the risk of diarrhea with a duration > 4 days, and reduced stool frequency on the second day of symptoms, with overall greater efficacy when a viral etiology is identified; most trials report decreased duration and stool frequency, and no adverse events have been directly attributable in healthy recipients, though bacteremia or fungemia has occurred in critically ill or immunocompromised people. For zinc, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found oral zinc shortened acute diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years by 10 hours, with 27 hours reduction among children with signs of malnutrition; the effect on hospitalization and death could not be measured, treatment of persistent diarrhea was shortened by about 16 hours, vomiting was noted to be more common with zinc, and an RCT evaluating a 14-day course in US outpatients and inpatients aged 6 months to 6 years is ongoing.

### Zinc supplementation for preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years of age [^39a89b33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Zinc deficiency is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, and contributes to significant diarrhoea-, pneumonia-, and malaria-related morbidity and mortality among young children. Zinc deficiency also impairs growth.

Objectives

To assess the effects of zinc supplementation for preventing mortality and morbidity, and for promoting growth, in children aged six months to 12 years of age.

Search Methods

Between December 2012 and January 2013, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, African Index Medicus, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, Global Health, IndMED, LILACS, WHOLIS, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and WHO ICTRP.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of preventive zinc supplementation in children aged six months to 12 years compared with no intervention, a placebo, or a waiting list control. We excluded hospitalised children and children with chronic diseases or conditions. We excluded food fortification or intake, sprinkles, and therapeutic interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for missing information.

Main Results

We included 80 randomised controlled trials with 205,401 eligible participants. We did not consider that the evidence for the key analyses of morbidity and mortality outcomes were affected by risk of bias. The risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality was compatible with a reduction and a small increased risk of death with zinc supplementation (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 14 studies, high-quality evidence), and also for cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31, four studies, moderate-quality evidence), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15, three studies, moderate-quality evidence), or malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06, two studies, moderate-quality evidence). Supplementation reduced diarrhoea morbidity, including the incidence of all-cause diarrhoea (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.89, 26 studies, moderate-quality evidence), but the results for LRTI and malaria were imprecise: LRTI (RR 1, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07, 12 studies, moderate-quality evidence); malaria (RR 1.05, 95% 0.95 to 1.15, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence of a very small improvement in height with supplementation (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.06; 50 studies), but the size of this effect might not be clinically important. There was a medium to large positive effect on zinc status. Supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.46, five studies, high-quality evidence). We found no clear evidence of benefit or harm of supplementation with regard to haemoglobin or iron status. Supplementation had a negative effect on copper status.

Authors' Conclusions

In our opinion, the benefits of preventive zinc supplementation outweigh the harms in areas where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high. Further research should determine optimal intervention characteristics such as supplement dose.

### Zinc deficiency-associated dermatitis in infants during a nationwide shortage of injectable zinc-Washington, DC, and Houston, Texas, 2012–2013 [^537494af]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Zinc is an essential trace element that functions as a cofactor for certain enzymes involved in metabolism and cell growth; zinc supports immune function, protein metabolism, development of the gastrointestinal tract, and genetic processes. Acute zinc deficiency disorder is characterized by dermatitis around the limbs and body orifices, diarrhea, and impaired immune function, whereas chronic zinc deficiency disorder can lead to liver or kidney failure. A rare genetic disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, shares the same clinical manifestations as acute zinc deficiency disorder but is a metabolic disorder of zinc absorption. Zinc is a standard component in PN. Premature infants administered PN require 400 μ g/kg/body weight/day of zinc to maintain serum levels and promote growth, whereas 200 μ g/kg/body weight/day of zinc is sufficient for full-term infants on PN. Additionally, PN might be needed for prolonged periods for very low birth weight infants (< 1,500 g) and infants with chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction.

What is already known on this topic?

Nationwide shortages of parenteral micronutrients have continued to occur in recent years. These shortages can lead to clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies among patients who depend on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Premature infants are especially vulnerable, and certain micronutrient deficiencies can be lethal.

What is added by this report?

The nationwide shortage of injectable zinc that began in late 2012 led to seven reported cases of zinc deficiency disorder in vulnerable infants. Among these infants, six experienced severe dermatitis, and three experienced invasive bacterial infections. The Food and Drug Administration is now temporarily permitting the importation and sale of an injectable zinc product.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Hospitals with limited stocks of injectable zinc should consider reserving supplies for infants with the highest risk for deficiency (e.g. those who are premature [born at < 37 weeks' gestation] or have very low birth weight [< 1,500 g] and those with chronic or permanent gastrointestinal dysfunction). If shortages occur, monitoring patients on parenteral nutrition for signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies is crucial.

### Malnutrition and a rash: think zinc [^86b19fcc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Endemic zinc deficiency is recognised to be a common and serious problem in developing countries. However, it may be seen in routine practice in the UK, and can be easily overlooked. Malnutrition from any cause in conjunction with an undiagnosed cutaneous problem should alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Investigations may be unreliable, and if in doubt, a therapeutic trial of zinc supplementation is indicated. We present three cases of malnourished patients, in whom zinc deficiency was diagnosed after the development of cutaneous features. The malnutrition resulted from alcoholism in two cases and anorexia nervosa in the third. The heterogeneity of underlying causes of zinc deficiency is discussed, along with its effects, treatment and zinc homeostasis.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^b8b2609b]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Who are at risk of zinc deficiency?

Emerging characteristics regarding COVID–19 show that patients most at risk of fatal outcome of COVID–19 are the elderly, those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, overweight and cancer. Male show increased risk compared with female. Comparing these outcomes to the risk groups for low zinc status then the following can be noticed: the elderly population, more at risk of severe COVID–19 disease, is also more at risk of zinc deficiency. A cross–sectional population survey among a random sample of elder participants, aged 67–87 years, found 10.1% zinc deficient, in line with previous studies. The prevalence was significantly higher as age increased and notably more men (13.1%) than women (7.3%) were zinc depleted. A zinc–poor diet, increased alcohol–intake and disease–state can all contribute to zinc depletion.

Concerning diabetes, a meta–analysis including 52 studies on micronutrients in diabetes demonstrated significantly lower zinc status for patients with diabetes (n = 20 183) compared with controls. The results of this study are consistent with other studies that observed zinc depletion in up to 77% of patients with type 2 diabetesor found an inverse correlation between blood glucose and zinc levels. Furthermore, research demonstrates that obesity predisposes for zinc deficiency. Studies have revealed reduced serum zinc levels in up to 28% of obese individuals prior to bariatric surgery and in 36%–51% of patients afterwards. Another study in Spain among 115 morbid obese women found 74% of them zinc deficient. In conclusion, these studies suggest a strong correlation between age, diabetes, overweight and zinc status.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^52bcb537]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea causes around two million child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation could help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea, and is recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Strategy

In November 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing oral zinc supplementation (≥ 5 mg/day for any duration) with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. Diarrhoea duration and severity were the primary outcomes. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using the fixed- or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

Main Results

Eighteen trials enrolling 6165 participants met our inclusion criteria. In acute diarrhoea, zinc resulted in a shorter diarrhoea duration (MD -12.27 h, 95% CI -23.02 to -1.52 h; 2741 children, 9 trials), and less diarrhoea at day three (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; 1073 children, 2 trials), day five (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; 346 children, 2 trials), and day seven (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 4087 children, 7 trials). The four trials (1458 children) that reported on diarrhoea severity used different units and time points, and the effect of zinc was less clear. Subgroup analyses by age (trials with only children aged less than six months) showed no benefit with zinc. Subgroup analyses by nutritional status, geographical region, background zinc deficiency, zinc type, and study setting did not affect the results' significance. Zinc also reduced the duration of persistent diarrhoea (MD -15.84 h, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24 h; 529 children, 5 trials). Few trials reported on severity, and results were inconsistent. No trial reported serious adverse events, but vomiting was more common in zinc-treated children with acute diarrhoea (RR 1.71, 95% 1.27 to 2.30; 4727 children, 8 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where diarrhoea is an important cause of child mortality, research evidence shows zinc is clearly of benefit in children aged six months or more.

### Symptomatic acquired zinc deficiency in at-risk premature infants: high dose preventive supplementation is necessary [^51569837]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Zinc is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in many metabolisms. Zinc deficiency induces various disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica, either inherited or acquired. We report three cases of premature infants (24–31 wks gestational age) with low birthweight (650 to 940 g) and enteropathy, two of whom presented with necrotizing enterocolitis. All infants were fed by total parenteral nutrition. At a chronological age ranging from 73 to 80 days, all infants developed a periorificial dermatitis. Before the onset of the first signs, they had received zinc supplementation ranging from 146% to 195% of the recommended dose (400 microg/kg/day). Increased zinc supplementation over a course of 6–18 days induced a complete resolution of symptoms in all cases. No abnormality in the neurologic examination and no recurrence were observed at the end of the zinc treatment. Low birthweight premature infants with enteropathy on total parenteral nutrition are at risk of developing zinc deficiency. The usual recommended zinc supplementation is probably insufficient for those infants. A delay in the diagnosis of zinc deficiency may lead to severe complications.

### Severe infant rash resistant to therapy due to zinc deficiency [^527f5606]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric skin diseases are a common presenting complaint to emergency medicine physicians but often pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Skin eruptions that are unusually severe for the diagnosis in question, lasting beyond the typical time of resolution, or not responding to conventional therapy should raise concern of a misdiagnosis. We present the case of a severe rash not responding to conventional atopic dermatitis therapy that led to a diagnosis of transient neonatal zinc deficiency. Clinicians caring for children should be aware of zinc deficiency and its corresponding clinical presentation, because it is readily treatable and may lead to the avoidance of unnecessary treatments and prevention of serious complications.

### Zinc: an essential but elusive nutrient [^34e35948]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Zinc is essential for multiple aspects of metabolism. Physiologic signs of zinc depletion are linked with diverse biochemical functions rather than with a specific function, which makes it difficult to identify biomarkers of zinc nutrition. Nutrients, such as zinc, that are required for general metabolism are called type 2 nutrients. Protein and magnesium are examples of other type 2 nutrients. Type 1 nutrients are required for one or more specific functions: examples include iron, vitamin A, iodine, folate, and copper. When dietary zinc is insufficient, a marked reduction in endogenous zinc loss occurs immediately to conserve the nutrient. If zinc balance is not reestablished, other metabolic adjustments occur to mobilize zinc from small body pools. The location of those pools is not known, but all cells probably have a small zinc reserve that includes zinc bound to metallothionein or zinc stored in the Golgi or in other organelles. Plasma zinc is also part of this small zinc pool that is vulnerable to insufficient intakes. Plasma zinc concentrations decline rapidly with severe deficiencies and more moderately with marginal depletion. Unfortunately, plasma zinc concentrations also decrease with a number of conditions (eg, infection, trauma, stress, steroid use, after a meal) due to a metabolic redistribution of zinc from the plasma to the tissues. This redistribution confounds the interpretation of low plasma zinc concentrations. Biomarkers of metabolic zinc redistribution are needed to determine whether this redistribution is the cause of a low plasma zinc rather than poor nutrition. Measures of metallothionein or cellular zinc transporters may fulfill that role.

### Innovative uses for zinc in dermatology [^721f38ee]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Severe zinc deficiency states, such as acrodermatitis enteropathica, are associated with a variety of skin manifestations, such as perioral, acral, and perineal dermatitis. These syndromes can be reversed with systemic zinc repletion. In addition to skin pathologies that are clearly zinc-dependent, many dermatologic conditions (eg, dandruff, acne, and diaper rash) have been associated and treated with zinc. Success rates for treatment with zinc vary greatly depending on the disease, mode of administration, and precise zinc preparation used. With the exception of systemic zinc deficiency states, there is little evidence that convincingly demonstrates the efficacy of zinc as a reliable first-line treatment for most dermatologic conditions. However, zinc may be considered as an adjunctive treatment modality. Further research is needed to establish the indications for zinc treatment in dermatology, optimal mode of zinc delivery, and best type of zinc compound to be used.

### The risk of copper deficiency in patients prescribed zinc supplements [^67643d7c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

In high doses zinc may cause copper deficiency, a diagnosis that is often missed resulting in anaemia, neutropenia and irreversible neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess if zinc deficiency is erroneously diagnosed by misinterpretation of plasma zinc concentrations and whether copper deficiency is induced in patients prescribed zinc.

Methods

Casenotes of 70 patients prescribed zinc were scrutinised. Plasma concentrations of zinc, copper, C reactive protein and albumin were recorded from the laboratory database.

Results

62% of patients were prescribed zinc at doses sufficient to cause copper deficiency. In 48% of the patients, plasma zinc concentrations were low as a probable result of hypoalbuminaemia or the systemic inflammatory response rather than deficiency. Awareness of copper deficiency was lacking; it was only documented as a possible side effect in one patient and plasma copper was measured in only two patients prescribed zinc. 9% of patients developed unexplained anaemia and 7% developed neurological symptoms typical of copper deficiency.

Conclusions

Zinc deficiency is frequently misdiagnosed on the basis of low plasma zinc concentrations. The potential risk of copper deficiency developing in patients prescribed high doses of zinc is apparently infrequently considered. It is probable that a significant minority of patients prescribed with high doses of zinc develop iatrogenic copper deficiency.

### Low serum zinc levels predict presence of depression symptoms, but not overall disease outcome, regardless of ATG16L1 genotype in Crohn's disease patients [^b3643963]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency is common in CD, with up to one third of all patients presenting with low serum zinc levels, even in patients in clinical remission.ZD in turn may exacerbate CD by increasing mucosal permeability, leading to neutrophil transmigration and luminal antigen permeation. Such increased mucosal permeability has been shown to correlate with both, CD activityand relapse probability. Despite high prevalence of ZD in IBD and its links to inflammation, so far no study investigated the role of serum zinc as a potential predictive serum marker for future disease course and its potential causative role in patients with a low or absent inflammatory disease activity.

Zinc levels have also been implicated in psychiatric disorders, where zinc is involved in several neurobiological and inflammation processes affecting mood. – Increasing evidence suggest an association between low serum zinc levels and depression; – however, whether this also applies to patients with IBD is, as yet, unknown. Scrutinizing the relationship of ZD with psychiatric symptomatology in IBD seems particularly important, as 24% and 37% of patients with CD have depression and anxiety, respectively, with these prevalence rates being almost twice as high in patients with active IBD. Both, depression and anxiety predict clinical recurrence in patients with CDand a bi-directional link between depressive mood and anxiety with the inflammatory response and disease course in IBD has been proposed. Particularly in the context of clinical disease remission, low serum zinc levels due to intestinal disease activity might be an important contributor to psychological symptoms in CD patients. Despite the high prevalence of both, ZD and symptoms of depression and anxiety in IBD patients, the impact of zinc levels and symptoms of depression or anxiety in IBD patients has not been explored. Table 1 provides a summary of existing and new knowledge regarding zinc deficiency.

Table 1.
Summary of existing and new knowledge regarding zinc deficiency.

We therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of ZD in CD patients in clinical remission and to analyze both a potential impact on future disease course as well as an interaction with mutations in ATG16L1. We further aimed to examine the association of zinc levels with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

### Transient symptomatic zinc deficiency in a breast-fed preterm infant [^2fecd369]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Transient, symptomatic zinc deficiency in breast-fed, low-birthweight infants is a rare, but probably underrecognized disorder hallmarked by periorificial and acral dermatitis. Unlike in acrodermatitis enteropathica, symptoms disappear when nursing ends. We report a breast-fed, preterm infant with demarcated, erythematous, and exudative patches with overlying crusts on the perioral, perianal, and acral areas. Laboratory investigations revealed lowered zinc levels in the infant's serum, but normal levels in his mother's milk. Oral zinc supplementation resulted in total clearing of skin lesions within 4 weeks. Our patient's presentation illustrates the importance of zinc in rapidly growing preterm infants and aims to stimulate awareness for this disorder. Symptomatic zinc deficiency can be easily diagnosed by careful examination and effectively treated with oral zinc substitution.

### Oral zinc for the common cold [^08fd8fee]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is oral zinc associated with a shorter duration, decreased severity, and reduced incidence of the common cold compared with placebo?

Bottom Line

When initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. However, there is no association between oral zinc and symptom severity, and the prevalence of adverse effects with zinc lozenges is high. Given the high heterogeneity of data, these results should be interpreted with caution. Used prophylactically, oral zinc is associated with a reduced cold incidence in children. Prophylactic use has not been studied in adults.

### Desquamative erythematous rash in a young woman [^81cbff22]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Zinc deficiency
B. Niacin deficiency
C. Biotin deficiency
D. Vitamin A deficiency
E. Protein deficiency

Answers:
A. Incorrect – Zinc deficiency leading to acrodermatitis enteropathica may present similarly with sharply demarcated erythematous, dry, scaly patches with superficial erosions. However, she did not have the typical distribution of rashes involving the periorificial, anogenital, and acral regions. There was also an absence of alopecia, nail changes, and diarrhea. Eventually, her serum zinc levels were found to be 754 ug/L (normal: 724–1244 ug/L).
B. Incorrect – Niacin deficiency leading to pellagra may present with rashes on the neck and upper portion of the chest resembling a "Casal necklace", a clinical sign comprising of a well-demarcated band of erythematous and hyperpigmented scaly rash around the neck. However, her flexural rashes were not photo-distributed. She had no other systemic symptoms besides deliberate weight loss. However, her niacin levels returned normal at 2.45 ug/mL (normal: 0.5–8.45ug/mL).
C. Correct – Biotin deficiency was suspected as biotin is a cofactor for zinc homeostasisin the skin. Mucocutaneous manifestations of biotin deficiency usually present 3 to 6 months after the onset of deficiency. They include acrodermatitis enteropathica-like rashes (often periorificial), erosions on flexural folds, alopecia, blepharoconjunctivitis, onychoschizia, and hyperesthesia. A low-serum biotin level was found in our patient at 0.2 ng/mL (normal ≥ 0.3 ng/mL). Although she did not present with all the mucocutaneous features of biotin deficiency, the replacement of biotin resulted in significant improvement and eventual resolution of her rashes within a few weeks. There has been no recurrence while she was on biotin supplementation. We postulate that the rashes may favor flexural location due to bending movements and friction, which cause the breakdown of the epidermis composed of degenerating keratinocytes due to the underlying nutritional deficiency. The patient was eventually prescribed high-dose oral biotin supplementation (10,000 mcg twice daily) in addition to multivitamins with the improvement of her rashes within a few days, which subsequently resolved in 3 weeks. She remains free of recurrence over the next one year after receiving biotin supplementation. In addition, she was also referred to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.
D. Incorrect – Patients with vitamin A deficiency may manifest as phrynoderma, which are clusters of follicular papules with central keratotic plugs. Histologic findings include keratinous plugs within follicles, hyperkeratosis, and sebaceous gland atrophy. Our patient did not have such skin or histologic findings, and her vitamin A levels were 0.46 mg/L (normal: 0.26–0.72 mg/L).
E. Incorrect – Kwashiorkor is an acute form of protein-energy malnutrition. Although patients with kwashiorkor can develop erythematous rashes with erosions and desquamation resembling "flaky paint", characteristic findings are peripheral edema or anasarca in association with hypoalbuminemia. This patient did not have any peripheral edema, and her serum albumin levels were normal at 44 g/L (normal: 38–48 g/L).

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^3ecb0c98]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to our findings on the impact of zinc administration on cold severity, there still seems to be no consensus on this topic despite efforts to reach a conclusion. The two most recent meta-analyses which standardized and pooled severity scores across their selected studies reported contrasting findings between placebo and zinc-administered groups from pooled studies. Johnstone et al.reported significantly less severe symptoms in the zinc-administered group (standardized MD: −0.64, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.24), but Singh et al.reported no difference in severity scores between these two groups (MD: −1.06, 95% CI: −2.36, 0.23). This discrepancy is not expected as both meta-analyses used similar statistical methods to process the data from their selected studies and included the same studies in their pooling, with the exception of an additional studyin Singh et al.to generate a mean difference. Hence, the conflicting observation could possibly be attributed to that additional study included (as it has a relatively high weight (26.9%) in the overall mean difference generated) or the problems associated with standardization, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

However, certain issues need to be addressed before making a decision on whether to provide these micronutrients supplementation as a long-term approach to effectively prevent and/or manage cold among healthy adults. The first issue is the safety of supplementing these micronutrients. Second, more standardized RCTs on the effects of micronutrients in healthy Asian populations are still needed to fully understand the collective and individual effects of micronutrients on cold prevention and management. Third, a standardized instrument and approach to measure symptom severity should be established for usage in future studies, to allow for the objective assessment of micronutrients' effect on symptom severity.

### Global and regional child mortality and burden of disease attributable to zinc deficiency [^61de0b40]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Zinc is an essential micronutrient and deficiency can lead to an increased risk for infectious diseases and growth retardation among children under 5 years of age. We aimed to estimate disease-specific and all-cause mortality attributable to zinc deficiency.

Subject/Methods

We estimated the prevalence of zinc deficiency in Latin America, Africa and Asia, where based on zinc availability in the diet and childhood stunting rates, zinc deficiency is widespread. The relative risks of death among zinc-deficient children for diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia were estimated from randomized controlled trials. We used the comparative risk assessment methods to calculate deaths and burden of disease (measured in disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) from each of these three diseases attributable to zinc deficiency in these regions.

Results

Zinc deficiency was responsible for 453,207 deaths (4.4% of childhood deaths), and 1.2% of the burden of disease (3.8% among children between 6 months and 5 years) in these three regions in 2004. Of these deaths, 260,502 were in Africa, 182,546 in Asia and 10,159 in Latin America. Zinc deficiency accounted for 14.4% of diarrhea deaths, 10.4% of malaria deaths and 6.7% of pneumonia deaths among children between 6 months and 5 years of age.

Conclusions

Zinc deficiency contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality, especially from diarrhea. Zinc supplementation provided as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea may be the best way to target children most at risk of deficiency.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to oral zinc supplements, IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate oral zinc supplementation to reduce the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years residing in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or having signs of malnutrition.

### Zinc deficiency after gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review [^6bebd9b8]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Up to 50% of patients have zinc deficiency before bariatric surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide. It can further exacerbate zinc deficiency by reducing intake as well as absorption. The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society, therefore, recommends that zinc level should be monitored routinely following gastric bypass. However, the American guidance does not recommend such monitoring for all RYGB patients and reserves it for patients with 'specific findings'. This review concludes that clinically relevant Zn deficiency is rare after RYGB. Routine monitoring of zinc levels is hence unnecessary for asymptomatic patients after RYGB and should be reserved for patients with skin lesions, hair loss, pica, dysgeusia, hypogonadism or erectile dysfunction in male patients, and unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4b8973fc]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Evidence from the current and previous meta-analyses demonstrate that zinc supplementation shortens the duration of ARIs considerably. In addition, zinc supplementation prevents mortality related to severe pneumonia. Zinc deficiency is widespread, affecting almost 20% of the global population, and regular intake of adequate quantities of zinc is required to prevent it. Zinc is a component of hundreds of enzymes and transcription factors, and plays critical roles in gene expression, cell division and immunity. It regulates the proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and functioning of epithelial cells and leucocytes. It also modulates the production of T lymphocytes, cytokines and reactive oxygen species. In addition, zinc improves appetite and its deficiency leads to anorexia, impairing intake of macronutrients and micronutrients essential to mount a robust immune response.

Multiple micronutrient deficiencies have been previously associated with elevated risk of respiratory infections, especially among the elderly. The studies included in this review used diverse formulations, and any inferences regarding the preventive effect of MMS was not possible. MMS, however, shortened the duration of symptoms considerably in the one study among older adults in India that examined it. It is plausible that the absence of an observed effect on prevention could be related to the dose of the micronutrients, or the extent of dietary inadequacies and nutritional deficiencies in the study population. Micronutrients are often provided at or below RDA level, which could be inadequate to address existing deficiencies. Evidence from studies of the effect of supplement administration on other viral infections such as HIV also support the potential that MMS could significantly slow disease progression and reduce mortality among HIV-infected individuals.

### Zinc supplementation for preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years [^ec380c4b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Zinc deficiency is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, and is considered a significant risk factor for morbidity, mortality, and linear growth failure. The effectiveness of preventive zinc supplementation in reducing prevalence of zinc deficiency needs to be assessed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of zinc supplementation for preventing mortality and morbidity, and for promoting growth, in children aged 6 months to 12 years.

Search Methods

A previous version of this review was published in 2014. In this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and one trials register up to February 2022, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive zinc supplementation in children aged 6 months to 12 years compared with no intervention, a placebo, or a waiting list control. We excluded hospitalized children and children with chronic diseases or conditions. We excluded food fortification or intake, sprinkles, and therapeutic interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing information and used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes of this review were all-cause mortality; and cause-specific mortality, due to all-cause diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, including pneumonia), and malaria. We also collected information on a number of secondary outcomes, such as those related to diarrhea and LRTI morbidity, growth outcomes and serum levels of micronutrients, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included 16 new studies in this review, resulting in a total of 96 RCTs with 219,584 eligible participants. The included studies were conducted in 34 countries; 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks. We did not consider that the evidence for the key analyses of morbidity and mortality outcomes was affected by risk of bias. High-certainty evidence showed little to no difference in all-cause mortality with preventive zinc supplementation compared to no zinc (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.03; 16 studies, 17 comparisons, 143,474 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that preventive zinc supplementation compared to no zinc likely results in little to no difference in mortality due to all-cause diarrhea (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31; 4 studies, 132,321 participants); but probably reduces mortality due to LRTI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 3 studies, 132,063 participants) and mortality due to malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06; 2 studies, 42,818 participants); however, the confidence intervals around the summary estimates for these outcomes were wide, and we could not rule out a possibility of increased risk of mortality. Preventive zinc supplementation likely reduces the incidence of all-cause diarrhea (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.93; 39 studies, 19,468 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but results in little to no difference in morbidity due to LRTI (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; 19 studies, 10,555 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to no zinc. There was moderate-certainty evidence that preventive zinc supplementation likely leads to a slight increase in height (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14; 74 studies, 20,720 participants). Zinc supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.46; 5 studies, 35,192 participants; high-certainty evidence). We report a number of other outcomes, including the effect of zinc supplementation on weight and serum markers such as zinc, hemoglobin, iron, copper, etc. We also performed a number of subgroup analyses and there was a consistent finding for a number of outcomes that co-supplementation of zinc with iron decreased the beneficial effect of zinc.

Authors' Conclusions

Even though we included 16 new studies in this update, the overall conclusions of the review remain unchanged. Zinc supplementation might help prevent episodes of diarrhea and improve growth slightly, particularly in children aged 6 months to 12 years of age. The benefits of preventive zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^59435c89]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

The present spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, provoking COVID–19 disease, progresses rapidly worldwide. In current absence of a curative treatment and an effective, safe vaccine, there is a pressing need to focus on identifying and correcting deficits in immune function in order to reduce risk of severe progress of the disease and to lower the number of infections and fatalities. This paper evaluates the most recent literature on zinc status related to antiviral immunity and its possible role in COVID–19. It is concluded that zinc is a critical factor for antiviral immunity. There is ample evidence suggesting that zinc depletion, also prevalent in high–income nations, compromises immune functions. Notably, major risk groups for COVID–19, the elderly, men more than women, obese individuals and patients with diabetes are all at risk of zinc deficiency. Moreover, various widely used antihypertensive drugs and statin therapy have been reported to negatively influence zinc status. As zinc depletion impairs antiviral immunity, it is hypothesised to increase susceptibility for COVID–19. Therefore, dietary preventive measures and prompt implementation of zinc supplementation for risk groups should be considered. Large–scale studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of micronutrients and antiviral immunity, in particular drug–micronutrient immunity interaction.

### Zinc deficiency-associated dermatitis in infants during a nationwide shortage of injectable zinc-Washington, DC, and Houston, Texas, 2012–2013 [^67b559a0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Studies have reported progressively decreasing serum zinc levels among infants on zinc-deficient PN, particularly premature infants and low birth weight infants. Although zinc deficiency disorder can have serious health implications among all age groups, infants are particularly vulnerable because their systemic zinc reserves are not fully developed and they are totally dependent on breast milk or formula. Therefore, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition recommends adding injectable zinc to PN for all infants and children, with priority for those who are premature, have low birth weight, or have chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Zinc deficiencies among infants are difficult to identify for multiple reasons, including nonspecific signs and symptoms. The most common signs of zinc deficiency disorder include dermatitis and growth impairment, which can be attributed to multiple causes. Zinc deficiency disorder–associated dermatitis, which is a physical manifestation, is present in only the most severe cases. For premature infants, withdrawl of the amount of blood required to measure the serum zinc level might compromise the health of the infant; therefore, routine testing is not performed, which might explain, in part, why no other cases were reported.

Physicians who prescribe PN should recognize the potential risks for micronutrient deficiency, including zinc deficiency, among premature infants who require increased amounts or are unable to receive adequate doses. During shortages, clinicians might need to reserve micronutrients for the most vulnerable populations. According to FDA, shortages also are ongoing for other PN micronutrient components (e.g. selenium, chromium, and copper); FDA is working with manufacturers to prioritize which micronutrients to produce and to identify other sources for the micronutrients. Until the manufacture of these micronutrients increases, shortages will continue. Hospitals with limited stocks of injectable zinc should consider reserving available supplies for infants with the highest risk for deficiency. Whenever PN without the standard micronutrients is administered to patients, either as a result of shortages or other considerations, monitoring for signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies is recommended. Health-care providers should always consider the specific clinical situation when applying these guidelines for individual clinical care.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^394ee45f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Thirty‐three trials, enrolling 10,841 children, met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries where the risk of zinc deficiency is high.

Acute diarrhoea

There is currently not enough evidence from well conducted trials to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces the number of deaths or the number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence).

In children aged greater than six months, zinc supplementation may shorten the duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of moderate malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (high certainty evidence).

Conversely, in children less than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no impact on the duration of diarrhoea (low certainty evidence), and may increase the proportion of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (low certainty evidence).

No trials reported serious adverse events, but zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea causes vomiting in both age groups (moderate certainty evidence).

Persistent diarrhoea

In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (moderate certainty evidence).

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This Cochrane Review showed that zinc overall reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea. However, most trials were conducted in populations with moderate to high risk of zinc deficiency (Asia, Africa, children over six months of age and with some degree of malnutrition). Transferability of these results to other countries is therefore likely to depend on local risk of zinc deficiency and other population characteristics such as the degree of malnutrition and breastfeeding habits. The few trials conducted in populations at low risk of zinc deficiency, namely well‐nourished children in countries and continents where zinc deficiency is uncommon (Europe, Australia), overall showed no benefit of zinc.

Most trials were conducted in hospital where participants are more likely to adhere to the intervention, but some community trials also showed a benefit with zinc, which suggests that zinc could be used both at hospital and at community level.

The observed increase in vomiting was consistent across trials in all age groups with one large trial reporting that vomiting was limited to one episode in most children and mainly occurring within 10 minutes of administration (Larson 2005). Zinc has a metallic after‐taste, and development of a more palatable formulation may minimize this adverse effect.

### A literature review of taste change and zinc deficiency after bariatric surgery: could there Be a causal link? [^4d263070]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In this review, we collated evidence relating to taste change and zinc deficiency in relation to bariatric surgery (BS) and effects of zinc replacement on taste perception and speculate on the possible role of zinc deficiency to induce taste change after BS. A literature search was conducted (33 studies, N = 3264). We showed that taste change and zinc deficiency are frequent complications after BS, which both typically occurred at 6 months post-surgery. Our analysis did not support a causal link between the two, but similar onset of incidences indirectly indicates a link. Supplementation with 45–50 mg of zinc sulphate, higher than current recommendation, was effective in improving taste. Further studies are required to establish the causal link between the two in the context of BS.

### What are the micronutrient deficiencies responsible for the most common nutritional symptoms after bariatric surgery? [^47169438]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients complain of nutritional symptoms after bariatric surgery (BS), including hair loss, cramps, and paresthesia, but their link with biological alterations has been poorly studied.

Objectives

To assess in a large cohort of subjects the relationship between nutritional symptoms and biological deficits both in the short term (ST ≤ 1 year) and long term (LT ≥ 3 years) after the 2 most common procedures, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

Methods

Nutritional symptoms and biological parameters (including vitamins, minerals, and protein parameters) were prospectively recorded. All subjects with complete clinical and biological assessments from 2011 to 2018 were included.

Results

After BS, 555 subjects were studied in the ST (50% RYGB) and 494 in the LT (79% RYGB); multivitamin intake was 97% and 78%, respectively. The proportion of patients with hair loss decreased from 65 (ST) to 35% (LT) (p < 0.001). In contrast, cramps increase from 7 to 32% and paresthesia from 11 to 18% (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between SG and RYGB. In subjects with hair loss, blood parameters of protein and iron metabolism were significantly lower than in subjects without hair loss, both in the ST and LT. In contrast, neither zinc nor group B vitamin levels were significantly different. None of the nutritional parameters tested was clearly associated with cramps and paresthesia.

Conclusion

After BS, the most frequent nutritional symptom is hair loss, essentially linked to iron and protein deficiencies. The causes of other nutritional symptoms are less clear and probably more heterogeneous.

### Low serum zinc levels predict presence of depression symptoms, but not overall disease outcome, regardless of ATG16L1 genotype in Crohn's disease patients [^70324559]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, zinc deficiency in CD patients with clinical remission did not seem to be as relevant as previously thought based on the rather sparse literature. However, low serum zinc levels were an independent predictor for presence of depression symptoms. Whether supplementation can be recommended in those patients in general has to be determined in the future. In the absence of active disease, low zinc levels did not predict complicated disease course regardless of ATG16L1 genotype.

### Therapeutic effects of oral zinc in acute and persistent diarrhea in children in developing countries: pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c35328e0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Zinc deficiency is prevalent in children in developing countries. Supplemental zinc provides therapeutic benefits in diarrhea.

Objective

We sought to measure the effect of supplemental zinc given with oral rehydration therapy during recovery from acute or persistent diarrhea.

Design

We conducted pooled analyses including all available published and unpublished randomized controlled trials of the effects of supplementary oral zinc in children aged < 5 y with acute or persistent diarrhea. We used Cox survival regression analysis to evaluate the overall effect of zinc on continuation of diarrhea and possible differential effects in subgroups divided by sex, age, weight-for-height, and initial plasma zinc concentration. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by logistic regression. To assess the effects of excluding studies without original data from the pooled analyses, effect-size was estimated for all studies by using random-effects models.

Results

Zinc-supplemented children had a 15% lower probability of continuing diarrhea on a given day (95% CI: 5%, 24%) in the acute-diarrhea trials and a 24% lower probability of continuing diarrhea (95% CI: 9%, 37%) and a 42% lower rate of treatment failure or death (95% CI: 10%, 63%) in the persistent-diarrhea trials. In none of the subgroup analyses were the 2 subgroups of each pair significantly different from each other; however, in persistent diarrhea there tended to be a greater effect in subjects aged < 12 mo, who were male, or who had wasting or lower baseline plasma zinc concentrations.

Conclusion

Zinc supplementation reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea.

### Acrodermatitis caused by nutritional deficiency and metabolic disorders [^6217f485]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Both the metabolism and dietary intake of vitamins and minerals are essential to homeostatic function in the body. Dietary excess or deficiency, as well as genetic and acquired disorders in metabolism, can present dermatologically and systemically. More specifically, disorders in metabolism of zinc, biotin, essential fatty acids, and vitamin B, can appear with acrally distributed dermatoses. Recognition of the dermatologic manifestations associated with nutritional disorders is important for early diagnosis and management.

### Zinc supplementation for the promotion of growth and prevention of infections in infants less than six months of age [^7745e1ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Zinc is a vital micronutrient for humans and is essential for protein synthesis, cell growth, and differentiation. Severe zinc deficiency can lead to slower physical, cognitive and sexual growth, cause skin disorders, decrease immunity, increase incidence of acute illnesses in infants and children and contribute to childhood stunting. By estimation, 17.3% of the world population is at risk of inadequate zinc intake. Such nutritional impairment increases the risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia by 20%, as well as leads to a global loss of more than 16 million disability-adjusted life years in children less than five years of age. Not only does zinc deficiency affect lives, it adds to the considerable financial burden on depleted resources in countries that are most affected. By preventing or curing this deficiency, we can improve childhood mortality, morbidity and growth.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for the promotion of growth, reduction in mortality, and the prevention of infections in infants less than six months of age.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 18 May 2018), Embase (1980 to 18 May 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 18 May 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. An updated search from 1 January 2018 to 29 January 2020 was run in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCOhost.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled (individual and cluster randomised) and quasi-randomised trials of zinc supplementation in healthy, term infants, less than six months of age comparing infant mortality, incidence of diarrhoea or respiratory illnesses, growth and/or serum zinc levels were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened search results (title and abstracts) and relevant full texts. Studies fulfilling prespecified inclusion criteria were included with any disagreements resolved by consensus. Extraction and analysis were then conducted. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence as indicated by certainty in effect estimates.

Main Results

Eight studies (with 85,629 infants) were included and five studies were meta-analysed, out of which four studies compared zinc with placebo, and one compared zinc plus riboflavin versus riboflavin. Certain growth outcomes after six months of intervention (Weight for Age Z-scores (WAZ) (standardised mean difference) (SMD) 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.29; three studies, n = 955; fixed-effect; heterogeneity Chi² P = 0.96); I² = 0%); change in WAZ (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.25; one study, n = 386; fixed-effect); (Weight-for-Length Z-score (WLZ) (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.28; three studies, n = 955; fixed-effect; heterogeneity: Chi² P = 0.81); I² = 0%); (change in WLZ (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28; one study, n = 386; fixed-effect)) were positively affected by zinc supplementation compared to placebo. A single study reported no difference in the incidence of diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infection with zinc supplementation. Zinc had no effect on mortality in children younger than 12 months. When zinc plus riboflavin was compared to riboflavin only, significant improvement was observed in the incidence of wasting at 24 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.96; one study, n = 296; fixed-effect), but significant worsening of incidence of stunting was present at 21 months (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; one study, n = 298; fixed-effect).

Authors' Conclusions

There was a significant positive impact of zinc supplementation on WAZ and WLZ after six months of intervention in infants compared to placebo. When a combined supplement of zinc and riboflavin was compared to riboflavin, there was a significant reduction in wasting at 24 months, but stunting at 21 months was negatively affected. Although included trials were of good-to-moderate quality, evidence that could be meta-analysed was based on a few studies which affected the overall quality of results. Regardless, there is a need for strong trials conducted in infants younger than six months before a strong recommendation can be made supporting zinc supplementation in this age group.

### Interventions for the management of taste disturbances [^64e53e97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The sense of taste is very much essential to the overall health of the individual. It is a necessary component to enjoying one's food, which in turn provides nutrition to an individual. Any disturbance in taste perception can hamper the quality of life in such patients by influencing their appetite, body weight and psychological well-being. Taste disorders have been treated using different modalities of treatment and there is no consensus for the best intervention. Hence this Cochrane systematic review was undertaken.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the management of patients with taste disturbances.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 5 March 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 5 March 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 5 March 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 5 March 2014) and AMED via OVID (1985 to 5 March 2014). We also searched the relevant clinical trial registries and conference proceedings from the International Association of Dental Research/American Association of Dental Research (to 5 March 2014), Association for Research in Otolaryngology (to 5 March 2014), the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (to 5 March 2014), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (to 5 March 2014), World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (to 5 March 2014) and International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) Clinical Trials Portal (to 5 March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological agent with a control intervention or any non-pharmacological agent with a control intervention. We also included cross-over trials in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently, and in duplicate, assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. Wherever possible, we contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse events information from the trials.

Main Results

We included nine trials (seven parallel and two cross-over RCTs) with 566 participants. We assessed three trials (33.3%) as having a low risk of bias, four trials (44.5%) at high risk of bias and two trials (22.2%) as having an unclear risk of bias. We only included studies on taste disorders in this review that were either idiopathic, or resulting from zinc deficiency or chronic renal failure. Of these, eight trials with 529 people compared zinc supplements to placebo for patients with taste disorders. The participants in two trials were children and adolescents with respective mean ages of 10 and 11.2 years and the other six trials had adult participants. Out of these eight, two trials assessed the patient reported outcome for improvement in taste acuity using zinc supplements (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1; very low quality evidence). We included three trials in the meta-analysis for overall taste improvement (effect size 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65; moderate quality evidence). Two other trials described the results as taste acuity improvement and we conducted subgroup analyses due to clinical heterogeneity. One trial described the results as taste recognition improvement for each taste sensation and we analysed this separately. We also analysed one cross-over trial separately using the first half of the results. None of the zinc trials tested taste discrimination. Only one trial tested taste discrimination using acupuncture (effect size 2.80, 95% CI -1.18 to 6.78; low quality evidence). Out of the eight trials using zinc supplementation, four reported adverse events like eczema, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, decrease in blood iron, increase in blood alkaline phosphatase, and minor increase in blood triglycerides. No adverse events were reported in the acupuncture trial. None of the included trials could be included in the meta-analysis for health-related quality of life in taste disorder patients.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude on the role of zinc supplements to improve taste perception by patients, however we found moderate quality evidence that zinc supplements improve overall taste improvement in patients with zinc deficiency/idiopathic taste disorders. We also found low quality evidence that zinc supplements improve taste acuity in zinc deficient/idiopathic taste disorders and very low quality evidence for taste recognition improvement in children with taste disorders secondary to chronic renal failure. We did not find any evidence to conclude the role of zinc supplements for improving taste discrimination, or any evidence addressing health-related quality of life due to taste disorders. We found low quality evidence that is not sufficient to conclude on the role of acupuncture for improving taste discrimination in cases of idiopathic dysgeusia (distortion of taste) and hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste). We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of zinc supplements or acupuncture as none of the trials compared these interventions.

### Zinc sulfate [^d6a1315e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients

- Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, or 5 mg/mL of zinc.

- Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.

- The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.

 Adults

The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.

 Pediatric Patients

The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients.

However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.

 Table 1: Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight

*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life

 Monitoring

Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment. Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics. Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range. The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory's sample requirements. Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes. The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL.

### Intravenous zinc therapy for acquired zinc deficiency secondary to gastric bypass surgery: a case report [^8a5d1f29]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency may result from either a congenitally inherited defect of zinc absorption or is acquired secondarily from a variety of factors affecting dietary zinc intake, absorption, or loss. We report a case of acquired zinc deficiency secondary to gastric bypass surgery that resulted in vulvar cutaneous manifestations of delayed onset, with failure to clear after oral supplementation with zinc. The patient experienced improvement of symptoms only after administration of intravenous zinc supplementation. Upon review of the current literature, it is thought that the patient's original suboptimal response to oral supplementation and improvement after receiving intravenous zinc were related to the intentional surgical alteration and bypass of the absorptive capacity of the duodenum and jejunum. With the current prevalence of obesity and availability of surgical weight loss therapies, it is important to be mindful of the resulting nutritional deficiencies, their clinical manifestations, and factors affecting the efficacy of therapeutic approaches as seen in this case.

### Zinc chloride (Zinc) [^d8cae340]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Zinc is an essential nutritional requirement and serves as a cofactor for more than 70 different enzymes including carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and both RNA and DNA polymerase. Zinc facilitates wound healing, helps maintain normal growth rates, normal skin hydration, and the senses of taste and smell.

Zinc resides in muscle, bone, skin, kidney, liver, pancreas, retina, prostate and particularly in the red and white blood cells. Zinc binds to plasma albumin, α2-macroglobulin, and some plasma amino acids including histidine, cysteine, threonine, glycine, and asparagine. Ingested zinc is excreted mainly in the stool (approximately 90%), and to a lesser extent in the urine and in perspiration.

Providing zinc helps prevent development of deficiency symptoms such as: Parakeratosis, hypogeusia, anorexia, dysosmia, geophagia, hypogonadism, growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly.

The initial manifestations of hypozincemia in total parenteral nutrition are diarrhea, apathy and depression. At plasma levels below 20 mcg zinc/100 mL dermatitis followed by alopecia has been reported for total parenteral nutrition patients. Normal zinc plasma levels are 100 ± 12 mcg/100 mL.

Discussion

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib have been shown to cause numerous well-documented adverse effects. These include hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthia. However, zinc deficiency, either independently or as a consequence of these other symptoms, is not an established effect of this medication class. In contrast, zinc deficiency is a documented side effect of a myriad of conditions, including postbariatric surgery, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis; in the vast majority of affected patients, correction has yielded significantly improved outcomes.

Zinc is essential for cell production and turnover in the skin, helping to maintain a protective barrier. Zinc deficiency is an important consideration when prescribing cabozantinib because of the risk of delaying zinc-dependent processes, including anti-inflammation, wound healing, and postinjury regeneration, if it goes undiagnosed. This patient's case of acquired zinc deficiency while on cabozantinib, with resolution of the rash once zinc levels were restored, indicates that anticancer medications like cabozantinib may somehow contribute to zinc deficiency. It is not possible to distinguish whether the etiology of this patient's zinc deficiency was the medication itself, the physiologic impact of his cancer, or the severe malnutrition and dehydration induced by his malaise, vomiting, and diarrhea, creating an electrolyte imbalance. Even so, the rectification of many of his symptoms with zinc supplementation suggests that zinc deficiency may play a role in multiple side effects of cabozantinib and similar drugs, such as mouth ulcers, nausea, and ageusia. Given that many of the reported side effects of cabozantinib therapy overlap with symptoms of zinc deficiency, testing for zinc levels in patients with severe symptoms might allow for quick correction of an otherwise unsuspected deficiency and provide rapid relief.

Although magnesium and potassium screening are recommended with cabozantinib, routine monitoring of zinc levels is not currently recommended. This case supports a potential association between tyrosine kinase inhibitor medications like cabozantinib and zinc deficiency, albeit not necessarily a causal one. Since zinc sulfate tends to be an affordable treatment regimen, regular screening and supplementation might provide an easily accessible way to improve patients' quality of life. In cases like the one described here, prophylactic zinc sulfate might even be directly incorporated into initial treatment for tumors like HCC to avoid inflammation, impaired healing, and other consequences of a zinc deficiency that may otherwise prove challenging to recognize and diagnose.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f790f4f4]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) — management of asymptomatic patients: Asymptomatic patients require treatment; however, urgency for starting treatment is greater if there is any evidence of organ damage due to either inflammation or structural damage. Treatment with a chelating agent, such as D-penicillamine or trientine, or with zinc effectively prevents disease progression and symptomatic disease. The starting dose of medication may be the same as for maintenance dosing. Individualization is important in children who are less than 3 years-old, and zinc appears preferable for these very young asymptomatic children, but there is no consensus as to whether treatment should be started without evidence of organ damage because of possible adverse effects of treatment on development.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^183c65be]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Zinc

Pathophysiology and Presentation

Zinc is essential in the structural integrity of essential proteins such as histones, zinc-finger proteins, tight junctions, alkaline phosphatase, and DNA/RNA polymerase. Zinc is absorbed through-out the intestine and competes for the same sites of absorption as copper and iron.

In adults, the most severe manifestation is the characteristic acrodermatitis enteropathica. Though commonly described as an autosomal recessive disease in children caused by impaired zinc transport, an acquired form of acrodermatitis enteropathica has been noted in nutritionally impaired adults. The hyperkeratotic "crusting" lesions commonly involves the eyes, mouth and perianal areas and is associated with significant edema and diarrhea. Patients may have poor wound healing with fistulization as zinc deficiency affects tight junctions. Mild eosinophilia may be present on blood tests as well as tissue samples.

Risk Factors

Absorption may be impaired by pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorptive states, inflammatory bowel disease as well as gastrointestinal resections. Pregnancy, alcoholism, cirrhosis, total parenteral nutrition, and diuretics, have also been associated with deficiency. One study noted approximately 70% of hemodialysis patients were noted to be zinc deficient.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Plasma zinc levels may be suppressed in the context of severe inflammation however they are accurate when associated with clinical findings. Modest supplementation about 30 to 45 mg/day is sufficient and should be given two hours after any iron supplementation. Long term treatment especially with doses > 50mg/d should be closely monitored as it has been associated with low copper status as well as side effects of diarrhea and GI distress.

### Comments on article by pullakhandam et al: reference cut-offs to define low serum zinc concentrations in healthy 1–19 year old Indian children and adolescents [^b40cc346]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

In the case of SZC, Wessells et al. found a clear relationship between SZC and the presence of clinical signs of zinc deficiency, both in adult volunteers exposed to experimental zinc deficiency and in patients with acrodermatitis enterpathica. However, as often occurs with nutritional biomarkers, there were overlapping distributions of SZC among those with and without deficiency signs, so no single cutoff provided perfect discrimination. In such cases, establishing a cutoff requires a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and judgement regarding which is more important in a particular situation. Such decisions may involve consideration of 1) the related disease severity, which if severe would call for applying greater sensitivity (higher cutoff, fewer false negatives), and 2) the cost of interventions relative to available resources and any potential adverse effects of these interventions, which would argue for greater specificity (lower cutoff, fewer false positives). In the case of zinc deficiency, where the consequences may be severe, greater sensitivity seems preferable to allow for intervention before clinical deficiency signs become apparent. Nevertheless, individual countries might choose to apply a lower cutoff if they are willing to tolerate a greater risk of deficiency or available resources only permit limited intervention.

The use of different country-specific cutoffs poses a dilemma with regard to tracking deficiency prevalence globally and related resource allocations. One possible solution would be to agree on a single global cutoff for tracking purposes, while individual countries could determine local cutoffs to trigger programmatic responses. In cases where the cutoff is based on statistical criteria, the reference population must be healthy, adequately nourished, and ideally representative of the global population, not just a single country.

Addressing this set of issues will require global consensus on best practices to develop appropriate biomarker cutoffs to define MN deficiency (and excess) and efforts to compile or collect relevant data. The Micronutrient Forum has recently established the Data Innovation Alliance (DInA) to facilitate this process. DInA is engaging micronutrient data users and producers at global and national levels to generate consensus recommendations to ensure that micronutrient data are both consistent globally and relevant for national decision makers.

In summary, the Indian nutrition and public health communities should be applauded for generating data on the population's zinc status. As new data become available, they should be reported according to international consensus criteria; but the interpretation of these results and related policymaking are the responsibility and prerogative of national stakeholders.

### Low serum zinc levels predict presence of depression symptoms, but not overall disease outcome, regardless of ATG16L1 genotype in Crohn's disease patients [^a0ad242f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

It is advocated that patients with IBD should be screened for psychological comorbidities, including depressive symptoms, and psychological support should be a part of standard care for those in need. However, whether zinc levels in CD patients with relevant depressive symptoms should be tested to start supplementation therapy in case of nutritional deficiency has yet to be determined. Currently available evidence as to whether zinc supplementation alleviates depressive symptoms in humans (without IBD) is scarce and conflicting. Nonetheless, our findings provide a rationale for zinc supplementation in CD patients with depressive symptoms, potentially even in patients with low–normal serum zinc levels.

Our study has several strengths and some limitations. We provide the first study evaluating an association of serum zinc levels and psychiatric symptoms in CD patients. In addition, it is the first analysis that evaluates the effect of zinc levels on future disease course with regards to the presence or absence of the ATG16L1 risk variant, therefore linking epidemiological observations with molecular disease mechanisms. The SIBDCS is a large and well-established cohort with structured annual physician- and patient-based assessments. However, albeit the prospective nature of data acquisition, retrospective analysis with annual follow-up visits only may be associated with underreporting of symptoms in general and psychiatric symptoms in particular. A limitation of our study is that significantly more patients in the future complicated disease group had a follow up of 3+ years compared with those not experiencing any complications, which might lead to underreporting of late complications in the uncomplicated disease course group. However, as we only took into account the first complication (being sufficient to fall into the complication category), we feel rather confident to assume the two groups and their follow up to be comparable. Our study might be underpowered to detect weaker effects of ZD on disease course. The role of zinc may have been underestimated, since all patients were in clinical remission at baseline without frank zinc deficiency. Although all patients were in clinical remission at baseline, patients with a future complicated disease course had higher CDAI values at first visit and reported a longer CD duration. This slightly, but significantly higher clinical disease activity and the longer disease duration might be considerable confounders of our analysis. And finally, zinc levels were only measured at baseline, but not during follow up and during flares, although, presumably, these levels are prone to fluctuations, which should be taken into account in future studies.

### Interventions for managing taste disturbances [^13465616]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The sense of taste is very much essential to the overall health of an individual. It is a necessary component to enjoy one's food, which in turn provides nutrition to an individual. Any disturbance in taste perception can hamper quality of life in such patients by influencing their appetite, body weight and psychological well-being. Taste disorders have been treated using different modalities of treatment and there is no consensus for the best intervention. Hence this Cochrane Review was undertaken. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in November 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the management of patients with taste disturbances.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 4 July 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017 Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library (searched 4 July 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 4 July 2017); Embase Ovid (1980 to 4 July 2017); CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 4 July 2017); and AMED Ovid (1985 to 4 July 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for trials. Abstracts from scientific meetings and conferences were searched on 25 September 2017. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological agent with a control intervention or any non-pharmacological agent with a control intervention. We also included cross-over trials in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently, and in duplicate, assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. Wherever possible, we contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected adverse events information from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials (581 participants), nine of which we were able to include in the quantitative analyses (566 participants). We assessed three trials (30%) as having a low risk of bias, four trials (40%) at high risk of bias and three trials (30%) as having an unclear risk of bias. We only included studies on taste disorders in this review that were either idiopathic, or resulting from zinc deficiency or chronic renal failure. Of these, nine trials with 544 people compared zinc supplements to placebo for patients with taste disorders. The participants in two trials were children and adolescents with respective mean ages of 10 and 11.2 years and the other seven trials had adult participants. Out of these nine, two trials assessed the patient-reported outcome for improvement in taste acuity using zinc supplements (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 2.09; 119 participants, very low-quality evidence). We meta-analysed for taste acuity improvement using objective outcome (continuous data) in idiopathic and zinc-deficient taste disorder patients (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65; 366 participants, three trials, very low-quality evidence). We also analysed one cross-over trial separately using the first half of the results for taste detection (mean difference (MD) 2.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 4.07; 14 participants, very low-quality evidence), and taste recognition (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 5.34; 14 participants, very low-quality evidence). We meta-analysed taste acuity improvement using objective outcome (dichotomous data) in idiopathic and zinc-deficient taste disorder patients (RR 1.42, 95% 1.09 to 1.84; 292 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Out of the nine trials using zinc supplementation, four reported adverse events like eczema, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, decrease in blood iron, increase in blood alkaline phosphatase, and minor increase in blood triglycerides. One trial tested taste discrimination using acupuncture (MD 2.80, 95% CI -1.18 to 6.78; 37 participants, very low-quality evidence). No adverse events were reported in the acupuncture trial. None of the included trials could be included in the meta-analysis for health-related quality of life in taste disorder patients.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude on the role of zinc supplements to improve taste acuity reported by patients and very low-quality evidence that zinc supplements improve taste acuity in patients with zinc deficiency/idiopathic taste disorders. We did not find any evidence to conclude the role of zinc supplements for improving taste discrimination, or any evidence addressing health-related quality of life due to taste disorders. We found very low-quality evidence that is not sufficient to conclude on the role of acupuncture for improving taste discrimination in cases of idiopathic dysgeusia (distortion of taste) and hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste). We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of zinc supplements or acupuncture as none of the trials compared these interventions.

### Nutritional immunity: the impact of metals on lung immune cells and the airway microbiome during chronic respiratory disease [^e8565176]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Zinc deficiency has been observed in CF patients, especially those with malabsorption and impaired growth. The serum or plasma levels of subsets of CF patients, both child and adult, have been observed to be lower than healthy controls in several studies. Zinc supplementation has been used to treat CF patients, but studies have shown conflicting results, some have shown that zinc supplementation leads to improved lung function and reduced need for antibiotics and hospitalisations, while others showed no benefits for zinc supplementation. Interestingly, while zinc levels in serum can be low, zinc levels in the airways of CFs are reported to be higher. The prevalence and the impact of altered zinc homeostasis in CF is not yet well defined, however zinc levels affect microbial community structure in CF. Explants of CF lungs had S.aureus and P. aeruginosa co-existing in calprotectin enriched regions. As calprotectin chelates zinc, regions in the lungs enriched with this protein will have lower zinc levels which causes P. aeruginosa to reduce its production of antistaphyloccal factor thus allowing for the co-existence of this bacterial species.

Studies have found reduced activities of copper enzymes from cells (mononuclear cells, neutrophils and erythrocytes) in CF patients, possibly indicating reduced copper availability within these cells. Interestingly copper supplementation does not counteract this copper deficiency in CF patients indicating an altered copper metabolism that cannot be corrected simply by supplementation. One study reported that copper levels are elevated in the sputum in CF. The cause and consequences of altered copper homeostasis in CF are yet to be determined. Selenium deficiency is observed in CF patients but the levels of selenium in the CF lung have not been reported.

Non cystic fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis refers to the permanent widening of the bronchi and usually presents clinically with coughing, sputum production and recurring respiratory infections, along with other symptoms. The widening of the bronchi leads to impaired mucociliary clearance and failure to effectively clear microbes and mucus leading to persistent infection and inflammation. Bronchiectasis is complex and heterogenous and can be the final common feature of many infectious, inflammatory, and allergic disorders.

### Zinc concentration in preterm newborns at term age, a prospective observational study [^40e959ed]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Zinc is essential for enzyme function in individuals of all ages, including preterm infants. The typical symptoms of zinc deficiency usually develop after three continuous months of low serum zinc concentration (SZC) and include failure to thrive, poor weight gain, periorificial dermatitis, glossitis and increased susceptibility to infections. Regardless of the clinical severity of this deficiency, the role played by zinc in the growth of preterm newborns is crucial because, together with other micronutrients, this mineral is directly involved in the increase in birth weight (BW), birth length (BL) and head circumference at birth. Nonetheless, few studies to date have measured the SZC and associated factors in preterm newborns. However, there is an increasing interest in identifying the benefits of zinc supplementation, with an increasing number of studies improving infant growth with zinc supplementation. The most recent studies on the benefits of zinc in preterm infants demonstrated that morbidity decreased as zinc intake increased, and the analytical and clinical parameters of sepsis also improved.

This study aimed to measure SZC in a population of preterm newborns at term age, and analyse the anthropometric, clinical and nutritional parameters associated with a decrease in SZC.

### A meta-analysis of the effects of oral zinc in the treatment of acute and persistent diarrhea [^c75a1144]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Children in developing countries are at a high risk for zinc deficiency. Supplemental zinc has previously been shown to provide therapeutic benefits in diarrhea. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of supplemental oral zinc therapy during recovery from acute or persistent diarrhea.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to compare the efficacy and safety of supplementary oral zinc with placebo in children with acute and persistent diarrhea. Results were reported using a pooled relative risk or a weighted mean difference. A total of 22 studies were identified for inclusion: 16 examined acute diarrhea (n = 15,231), and 6 examined persistent diarrhea (n = 2968).

Results

Mean duration of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea was significantly lower for zinc compared with placebo. Presence of diarrhea between zinc and placebo at day 1 was not significantly different in acute diarrhea or persistent diarrhea trials. At day 3, presence was significantly lower for zinc in persistent diarrhea trials (n = 221) but not in acute diarrhea trials. Vomiting after therapy was significantly higher for zinc in 11 acute diarrhea trials (n = 4438) and 4 persistent diarrhea trials (n = 2969). Those who received zinc gluconate in comparison with zinc sulfate/acetate vomited more frequently. Overall, children who received zinc reported an 18.8% and 12.5% reduction in average stool frequency, 15.0% and 15.5% shortening of diarrhea duration, and a 17.9% and 18.0% probability of reducing diarrhea over placebo in acute and persistent trials, respectively.

Conclusions

Zinc supplementation reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea; however, the mechanisms by which zinc exerts its antidiarrheal effect have not been fully elucidated.

### Lost in the scales: alcohol-induced zinc deficiency [^32fe1976]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Which of the following investigations would help with the final diagnosis?
A. Anti-Ro/SSA antibody
B. Serum glucagon levels
C. Serum zinc levels
D. Antitissue transglutaminase antibodies
E. Antinuclear antibodies

Answer discussion:
C. Serum zinc levels. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare zinc deficiency disorder that may be congenital (due to an autosomal recessive mutation affecting zinc absorption) or acquired (due to nutritional deficiency). The acquired form arises from inadequate zinc intake or impaired absorption, and although more common in malnourished populations, it remains underrecognized in elderly patients with alcohol use disorders. In this case, the rash was initially misdiagnosed as psoriasis, but failed to respond to systemic and topical therapy. Notably, histopathology did not show classic psoriasiform features — a key clue that should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis. Our case expands this spectrum by demonstrating how chronic alcohol use can lead to severe zinc deficiency presenting as a psoriasis mimic. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for nutritional dermatoses when confronted with atypical morphology, poor treatment response, and systemic risk factors.

Zinc plays a vital role in maintaining the epidermal barrier by regulating lipid biosynthesis. It also contributes to cell growth and repair, wound healing, immune response, and antioxidant defense. Treatment with zinc replacement results in clinical improvement within weeks. Serum or plasma zinc levels and zinc-dependent enzyme levels should be monitored every 3 or 6 months.

### Zinc sulfate injection (zinc sulfate) [^f7bc96ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5	Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc.
Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.
The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.

Adults

The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients. However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.

Table 1: Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight

*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life

Monitoring

Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment. Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics. Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range. The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory's sample requirements. Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes. The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL.

### Zinc deficiency-associated dermatitis in infants during a nationwide shortage of injectable zinc-Washington, DC, and Houston, Texas, 2012–2013… [^faec4ae9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

µg/dL) and low alkaline phosphatase levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels typically are high in patients with cholestasis, but the zinc deficiency disorder in these infants resulted in low alkaline phosphatase levels. The serum zinc level for the first patient was not measured because suspicion of zinc deficiency disorder occurred after the infant had taken oral feedings containing zinc and the dermatitis had resolved. All seven infants had cholestasis. Six of the seven had dermatitis consistent with zinc deficiency disorder, and three experienced bacterial infections. One infant experienced recurrent sepsis and liver failure before receiving zinc-deficient PN. This infant did not have dermatitis but had a low serum zinc level. The infant died, and an autopsy was not performed.

Editorial Note Zinc is an essential trace element that functions as a cofactor for certain enzymes involved in metabolism and cell growth; zinc supports immune function, protein metabolism, development of the gastrointestinal tract, and genetic processes. Acute zinc deficiency disorder is characterized by dermatitis around the limbs and body orifices, diarrhea, and impaired immune function, whereas chronic zinc deficiency disorder can lead to liver or kidney failure. Studies have reported progressively decreasing serum zinc levels among infants on zinc-deficient PN, particularly premature infants and low birth weight infants. Although zinc deficiency disorder can have serious health implications among all age groups, infants are particularly vulnerable because their systemic zinc reserves are not fully developed and they are totally dependent on breast milk or formula.

Therefore, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition recommends adding injectable zinc to PN for all infants and children, with priority for those who are premature, have low birth weight, or have chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. Zinc deficiencies among infants are difficult to identify for multiple reasons, including nonspecific signs and symptoms. The most common signs of zinc deficiency disorder include dermatitis and growth impairment, which can be attributed to multiple causes. Zinc deficiency disorder–associated dermatitis, which is a physical manifestation, is present in only the most severe cases. For premature infants, withdrawl of the amount of blood required to measure the serum zinc level might compromise the health of the infant; therefore, routine testing is not performed, which might explain, in part, why no other cases were reported.

### Zinc chloride (Zinc) [^f01e0aeb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Direct intramuscular or intravenous injection of Zinc 1 mg/mL (Zinc Chloride Injection, USP) is contraindicated as the acidic pH of the solution (2) may cause considerable tissue irritation.

Severe kidney disease may make it necessary to reduce or omit chromium and zinc doses because these elements are primarily eliminated in the urine.

Copper Deficiency

Several post-marketing cases have reported that zinc products taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and myeloneuropathy.

If a patient develops signs and/or symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with zinc chloride, interrupt zinc treatment and check zinc and copper levels. Consider supplemental copper administration to treat copper deficiency and monitor zinc levels.

Aluminum Toxicity

This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

### Zinc acetate (Galzin) [^97c73f54]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Copper Deficiency

Several post-marketing cases reported that zinc acetate taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in decreased enteral copper absorption and copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and myeloneuropathy.

If a patient develops signs and/or symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with zinc acetate, interrupt zinc treatment and measure zinc, 24-hr urinary copper, and non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) levels. Consider restarting zinc acetate treatment based on periodic monitoring of 24-hr urinary copper and NCC levels.

Gastric Ulcer

There have been postmarketing reports of gastric ulcers with long-term use of zinc acetate. The cases reported the complications of anemia and gastric ulcer perforation with peritonitis. In some cases, ulcers persisted after treatment until zinc acetate was discontinued.

If a patient develops signs and/or symptoms of gastric ulcer during treatment with zinc acetate, discontinue zinc treatment. Most patients showed improvement after cessation of zinc treatment.

### Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold [^4d326b19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^2ef7f923]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Our results agree with those of other systematic reviews of zinc for treating children that have diarrhoea (Bhutta 2000b; Lukacik 2008; Patro 2008; Haider 2009; Liberato 2015; Zou 2015), except for the finding of no effect of zinc in children aged less than six months, and in populations at low risk of zinc deficiency. Compared to the other recent reviews (Liberato 2015; Zou 2015; Lazzerini 2016), this Cochrane Review includes several new trials, includes a more extensive subgroup analysis, and reports on diarrhoea at different time points, diarrhoea severity, death, and adverse events.

The results of this Cochrane Review in children over six months of age support the current WHO/UNICEF policy to give zinc to children with diarrhoea (WHO/UNICEF 2004), while currently there are no evidence from randomized controlled trials to provide zinc in children younger than six months of age.

### Zinc deficiency: a spot diagnosis [^8397da3c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The most common cause of Bitot's spots is vitamin A deficiency. This was excluded as vitamin A serum levels were found to be normal. Serum zinc, however, was decreased (0.51 mg/L; normal range 0.75–1.30 mg/L). 2 weeks after oral zinc supplementation (zinc sulfate 200 mg three times a day), serum zinc increased (1.04 mg/L) and the lesion and accompanying ocular surface symptoms disappeared completely after 6 weeks (figure 2). No primary cause of the zinc deficiency could be found by an internist.

Figure 2
Complete resolution of the Bitot's spot, 6 weeks after zinc supplementation.

A Bitot's spot is a textbook clinical sign that is traditionally associated with vitamin A (retinol) deficiency. In this case, however, it was related to an isolated zinc deficiency. Zinc is a trace element that is needed in the hepatic synthesis of retinol-binding protein, which mobilises retinol from the liver. Zinc deficiency can therefore lead to lower bioavailability of vitamin A. Other mechanisms have been proposed as well. There is little recent research on the synergistic effects between vitamin A and zinc. One study suggests that vitamin A deficiency in children is managed best by supplementing both vitamin A and zinc, instead of vitamin A alone. Our patient, however, solely had a zinc deficiency, which responded promptly to zinc supplementation. The lack of a clear cause for zinc deficiency in this patient is a limitation of this case report. Causes of zinc deficiency include decreased intake (such as a vegetarian diet), malabsorption (eg, gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease), cirrhosis and sickle cell disease.

### Obesity and age-related alterations in the gene expression of zinc-transporter proteins in the human brain [^a4ccaee5]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Plasma zinc constitutes the main readily available source in the body. Hence, obesity-induced hypozincemia will likely result in reduced zinc availability for the brain. Several studies, describe a reduced level of circulating zinc in obese individuals from which affect both total zinc levels and mean erythrocyte zinc levels. In morbidly obese eligible for bariatric surgery, as many as 73.9% were zinc deficient. Zinc deficiency correlates with elements of the metabolic syndrome such as insulin secretion, as well as with diabetes as such in which an increased loss of zinc in the urine is also seen. In general, an increased plasma volume could contribute to this pattern, as could reduce dietary zinc intake, which have been reported among obese individuals. As recently reviewed by Takeda et al.dietary zinc deficiency rarely results in measurable reductions in brain zinc concentrations. Physiologically, on the other hand, the sensitivity of the body to zinc deficiency is reflected by impaired learning and increased production of glucocorticosteroids as seen in several animal studies. As described by Stanstead, several neuropsychological studies indicate that marginal zinc deficiency might affect perception, attention or psychomotor skills in humans and that this can be corrected by zinc alone or in combination with other micronutrients. In addition, a recent study found that zinc supplementation reduced symptoms of depression as registered by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and increased plasma-BDNF levels in obese and overweight depressed humans. Similarly, several studies link zinc supplementation to increased cortical, cerebral and hippocampal levels of BDNF in mice.

### Analysis of similarities and differences between transient symptomatic zinc deficiency and acrodermatitis enteropathica in children: a case report of a Chinese Yi-ethnic infant [^e6a7f96d]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Infants and children develop zinc deficiency when the demand exceeds its supply. Inherited zinc deficiency, known as AE, has an incidence rate of 1/500,000. The condition is due to the SLC39A4 gene mutations, which limits the zinc absorption of the ZIP4 transporter in the small intestines, resulting in insufficient zinc absorption in the duodenum and jejunum. Statistics have shown that the prevalent high-frequency mutations of AE are located in exons 9, 3 and 5, and the clinical phenotypes vary with different exron mutations. Periorificial dermatitis, alopecia and diarrhoea are the characteristic symptoms of AE, but these three symptoms simultaneously occur in only 20% of patients. The systemic features also encompass irritability, lethargy, anorexia, growth impairment, anemia, neuropsychiatric disorders, immunological aberrations, and ocular anomalies such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, corneal opacities, and photophobia.

### Zinc sulfate [^7c6354ea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Monitor zinc concentrations, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.5 Copper Deficiency

Several post-marketing cases have reported that high doses of supplemental zinc (approximately 10 times the recommended dosage of 3 mg/day zinc sulfate injection in adults) taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in decreased enteral copper absorption and copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, myeloneuropathy, and nephrotic-range proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

If a patient develops signs and symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with zinc sulfate injection, interrupt zinc treatment and check zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels. Copper deficiency should be treated with supplemental copper administration and discontinuation of zinc supplementation.

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions to subcutaneously administered zinc-containing insulin products were identified in postmarketing case reports. Reported reactions included injection site induration, erythema, pruritus, papular rash, generalized urticaria, facial swelling, and dyspnea. Patients did not manifest symptoms after changing to zinc-free insulin or another insulin product with a reduced amount of zinc. In some cases, allergy testing confirmed the allergy to the zinc component of the insulin product. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue zinc sulfate injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications (4)].

### A literature review of taste change and zinc deficiency after bariatric surgery: could there Be a causal link? [^f12e5731]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Many high-quality papers have found a significant association between taste change and zinc deficiency. While causal link between taste and zinc deficiency after BS cannot be concluded from this review, the onset of both at approximately 6 months may suggest an indirect link between the two. Further interventional studies are required to confirm causal link. Importantly, current evidence has shown improvements in taste function, for patients with taste dysfunction, after receiving 30–45 mg of zinc supplementation daily over 6 months. This is twice the dosage usually prescribed to patients following BS. This suggests that zinc is an effective treatment for taste change, in many cases of taste disorder induced by different diseases. Yet studies into taste change in cancer patients found no significant improvement after similar doses of zinc supplementation. This may be explained by several interpretations. First, a small sample size makes it difficult to detect a significant difference between the placebo and intervention groups. Second, a lack of follow-up assessment may influence the outcome. Third, the absence of a formal taste test may impact the results. Fourth, mucositis and oral infections may also influence taste changes — as may other medications taken by cancer patients — and may also be important factors in delayed zinc intervention. It is also suggested that routine zinc supplementation after BS is not effective to avoid taste change and that patients require a double dosage, based on above-mentioned studies. We therefore believe that results from this review are in agreement with another review, stating that zinc supplementation may potentially be used to treat taste disorders.

Selenium and zinc deficiencies — clinical features and post-bariatric surgery considerations are noted. Selenium is a trace element that helps protect cells from free radical damage, and selenium deficiency may cause cardiomyopathy (i.e. Keshan disease). Selenium deficiency is rarely reported after bariatric surgery, can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality bariatric multivitamin/mineral/trace element supplement, and post-operative selenium levels are usually monitored only if signs and symptoms of deficiency are present. Zinc is important for intestinal mucosal function, and zinc deficiency can cause poor wound healing, hair loss, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like rash, taste alterations, glossitis, and impaired taste. Zinc deficiency sometimes occurs with sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is common with BPD-DS, can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality bariatric multivitamin/mineral/trace element supplement, and post-operative zinc levels are usually monitored only if signs and symptoms of deficiency are present.

### Zinc supplementation in critically ill patients: a key pharmaconutrient? [^a606fc3a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide a rationale for zinc supplementation as a potential therapeutic agent in critically ill patients by describing its role in health and disease, conducting a systematic review of current randomized trials in critical care, considering optimum route and dose of administration, and making recommendations for future research. Normal zinc homeostasis is required for a functional immune system, adequate antioxidant capacity, glucose homeostasis, and wound healing. In addition, zinc is a required cofactor for many enzymes, transcription factors, and replication factors. In non-critically ill patients, zinc supplementation has been associated with an improvement in markers of immune function. In critically ill patients, only 4 randomized trials have examined the effect of zinc supplementation on clinical outcomes. When all 4 studies were aggregated, zinc supplementation was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality (relative risk = 0.63, 95% confidence intervals 0.25–1.59, P = 0.33) and length of stay in intensive care (-0.35 days, -0.85 to 0.15; P = 0.17). Thus, because of the paucity of clinical data, there is inadequate evidence to recommend the routine use of high-dose zinc supplementation in the critically ill. A first step would be to determine the optimal dose that has a maximal positive effect on underlying inflammatory, immunologic, and metabolic processes yet is safe and tolerated by critically ill patients. Subsequently, large, rigorously designed, randomized trials are required to elucidate the efficacy of such doses of zinc supplementation in this patient population.

Bariatric surgery micronutrient screening — zinc and copper — details prevalence by procedure, annual screening, and preferred biomarkers. For zinc, up to 70% of patients post-BPD/DS, up to 40% of patients post-RYGB, up to 19% of patients post-SG, and up to 34% of patients post-AGB are noted; zinc deficiency is possible, even during zinc supplementation and especially if primary sites of absorption are bypassed, screening should be performed at least annually post-RYGB and post-BPD/DS, and serum and plasma zinc are the preferred biomarkers for screening in post-bariatric patients. For copper, up to 90% in patients post-BPD/DS, 10–20% in patients post-RYGB, 1 case report for patients post-SG, and no data for patients post-AGB are listed; screening is recommended at least annually after BPD/DS and RYGB, even in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, and serum copper and ceruloplasmin are recommended biomarkers for determining copper status.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Low-income and middle-income countries are increasingly facing a double burden of malnutrition, that is, the coexistence of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight) with overnutrition (overweight and obesity).
While the relationship between undernutrition and critical micronutrients for childhood growth and development (eg, iron, zinc and vitamin A (VA)) is well established, less is known about the risk of micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) in children and adolescents with overweight or obese, a hidden form of malnutrition.
There are limited data summarising associations between biomarkers of the most commonly limiting micronutrients and body weight status, particularly in children and young people.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^60e9ab07]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV2), provoking COVID–19 disease, progresses rapidly thereby urgently challenging the healthcare system worldwide. In the absence of curative treatment as well as an effective and safe vaccine at the moment, there is a pressing need to focus on identifying and correcting deficits in immune function, especially for those at risk for COVID–19. The elderly and people with comorbid conditions show increased risk of severe progression. Zinc status, known to be a critical factor for antiviral immune response, may have the potential to influence the course of the viral infection in individuals. Here, it is argued that particularly adult populations at risk of disturbed zinc homeostasis have increased risk of severe progression of COVID–19. Moreover, nutritional, immunological and clinical data suggest that zinc status may play a pivotal role in preventing and controlling COVID–19 disease. This opens up possibilities for targeted dietary preventive and nutritional intervention measures to improve antiviral immune response.

Zinc in antiviral immunity

Zinc is involved in generating innate as well as acquired antiviral immune response. First of all, zinc is essential for the barrier function of mucosal epithelium due to its antioxidant and anti–inflammatory activity. It also regulates tight junction proteins that are important for the maintenance of mucosal membrane integrity. Reduction of mucosal integrity and loss of tight junction cohesion aggravates viral inflammation. These deteriorations result in alveolar oedema, due to leakage of high weight proteins and water, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Proliferation, differentiation, maturation and functioning of leucocytes including lymphocytes are all regulated by zinc. Zinc ions regulate intracellular signalling pathways in both innate and adaptive immune cells. Hereby zinc acts directly by binding reversibly to regulating proteins or indirectly by modulating enzymes, such as phosphates, involved in signalling pathways. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines depend on zinc availability.ROS production is required for intracellular killing of pathogens as well as for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, released by granulocytes to neutralise pathogens. Zinc treatment in vitro has demonstrated to increase interferon α (IFNα) production by leukocytes, enhancing its antiviral activity.

### Analysis of similarities and differences between transient symptomatic zinc deficiency and acrodermatitis enteropathica in children: a case report of a Chinese Yi-ethnic infant [^0f7c1741]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Zinc is a vital micronutrient for the human body. As an essential coenzyme in metalloenzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, it regulates gene expression and is an important structural component of gene regulatory proteins, such as those required for intracellular binding of tyrosine kinases to T cell receptors. Zinc plays a variety of biological roles, including promoting growth and sexual organ development, maintaining taste and immune function, repairing skin and mucosa injury.

Zinc deficiency is clinically classified as genetic and acquired. The genetic disease, known as acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE, OMIM #201,100), is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to a mutation of the SLC39A4 gene (MIM #607,059), which encodes zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein 4 (ZIP4), leading to an impaired zinc absorption from the intestine. Transient symptomatic zinc deficiency (TSZD), the most common type of acquired zinc deficiency in infants, usually occurs in preterm, low birth weight and exclusively breastfed infants because of their negative zinc balance secondary to inadequate stores and intakes, malabsorption, increased requirements and possible low zinc level in the mother's milk. The clinical manifestations are similar in both inherited and acquired zinc deficiency characterized by dermatitis, alopecia and diarrhoea, so the differentiation is a big challenge. Severe zinc deficiency and the lack of zinc supplementation could lead to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in young children. Thus, the early identification and treatment of this disorder should be considered as a medical emergency.

### Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica from a ketogenic diet [^37183cdc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Zinc plays multiple important physiologic roles; it is a catalyst for many metabolic reactions, a structural component of numerous proteins, and is involved in gene expression and other regulatory functions. Zinc deficiency, whether acquired or congenital, can lead to the typical signs and symptoms of AE. AE classically presents with a triad of alopecia, dermatitis, and diarrhea. However, only 20% of the cases present with all 3, as observed in the present case. More advanced presentations include growth delay, hypogonadism, hypoguesia, poor wound healing, and increased risk for secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions. Diagnosis usually relies on a thorough patient history, physical exam, and investigation of serum zinc levels, but a high index of suspicion is necessary. Biopsy may be helpful, but histopathology is identical to other forms of nutritional deficiency dermatitis, such as niacin deficiency and necrolytic migratory erythema. Practitioners should be aware of the need for vitamin and mineral supplementation in patients on a ketogenic diet, especially those on a liquid formulation. Additionally, particularly given the rising popularity of the ketogenic diet, it is important to be aware of its potential side effects and their dermatologic manifestations; these include the possibility of prurigo, scurvy, and, as in our patient, acquired AE.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^3e28fc24]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The common cold had resulted in significant economic and social burden worldwide. The effect of vitamin C on preventing common cold in healthy adults has been investigated extensively, but not that of other micronutrients. Thus, we aim to assess the effects of providing micronutrients singly through oral means, on cold incidence, and/or management (in terms of cold duration and symptom severity) in healthy adults from systematically searched randomized controlled trials. From four electronic databases, 660 identified studies were screened and data were extracted from 20 studies (zinc, 10; vitamin D, 8; and vitamins A and E, 2). The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty in the outcomes was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days (when zinc is provided singly, 95% CI: -3.39, -1.12). This suggests that zinc supplementation may reduce the overall burden due to common cold among healthy adults.

### Zinc for the common cold [^25c2ff02]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is one of the most widespread illnesses and is a leading cause of visits to the doctor and absenteeism from school and work. Trials conducted since 1984 investigating the role of zinc for the common cold symptoms have had mixed results. Inadequate treatment masking and reduced bioavailability of zinc from some formulations have been cited as influencing results.

Objectives

To assess the effect of zinc on common cold symptoms.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May week 3, 2010) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least five consecutive days to treat, or for at least five months to prevent the common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We included 13 therapeutic trials (966 participants) and two preventive trials (394 participants). Intake of zinc is associated with a significant reduction in the duration (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.56 to -0.38) (P = 0.001), and severity of common cold symptoms (SMD -0.39; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.02) (P = 0.04). There was a significant difference between the zinc and control group for the proportion of participants symptomatic after seven days of treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.2 to 1.00) (P = 0.05). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing a cold (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88) (P = 0.006), school absence (P = 0.0003) and prescription of antibiotics (P < 0.00001) was lower in the zinc group. Overall adverse events (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.58) (P = 0.06), bad taste (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.91 to 3.64) (P < 0.00001) and nausea (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.44 to 3.23) (P = 0.002) were higher in the zinc group.

Authors' Conclusions

Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration and severity of the common cold in healthy people. When supplemented for at least five months, it reduces cold incidence, school absenteeism and prescription of antibiotics in children. There is potential for zinc lozenges to produce side effects. In view of this and the differences in study populations, dosages, formulations and duration of treatment, it is difficult to make firm recommendations about the dose, formulation and duration that should be used.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^f3552a61]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Copper

Pathophysiology and Presentation

Copper deficiency presents with fragile hair, muscle weakness, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and osteoporosis. Patients may have myelopathy, neuropathy, and ataxia on exam similar to subacute combined degeneration. Laboratory studies can reveal a pancytopenia and bone marrow dysplasia that mimics myelodysplastic disease, making it standard to exclude copper deficiency when evaluating a patients with potential myelodysplastic syndrome. An anemia that is refractory or worsens with iron supplementation can occur as iron can prevent copper absorption.

Risk Factors

Risk factors for acquired copper deficiency include excess zinc intake, chronic malabsorptive states, dialysis, bariatric surgery, bowel resection, and total parenteral nutrition. Excess zinc intake from denture cream adhesive has been implicated in copper deficiency.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Low plasma copper, and ceruloplasmin are indicative of deficiency. Repletion dose is largely based on consensus and depends on the adequacy of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Most regimens suggest 2mg of elemental copper a day for 1–3 weeks followed by 2mg of elemental copper if on-going deficiency is expected. Cessation of zinc supplementation is important in obtaining a clinical response.

### Retrospective study revealed that Zn relate to improvement of swallowing function in the older adults [^92dcff48]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Zinc is an essential micronutrient vital for maintaining a variety of biological activities in living organisms. Zinc is among the building blocks of many enzymes, functional proteins, and living tissue cells. Zinc availability is known to decrease in the older adults, especially in those over 75 years of age. Zinc deficiency causes various clinical symptoms, such as dysgeusia (i.e. distortion of taste), abnormal bone metabolism, skin lesions, gonadal dysfunction, decreased appetite, immune dysfunction, and delayed wound healing. Studies show that zinc supplementation is effective in ameliorating these conditions, highlighting zinc's homeostatic importance.

In the older adults, pneumonia-associated death is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Additionally, aspiration pneumonia is the most deliberating disease in the older adults resulting in impaired daily functional performance necessitating professional care. This condition is typically caused by aspiration of intraoral food debris during meals or saliva based on dysphagia. There are many causes of dysphagia, and impaired throat sensation (i.e. laryngeal hypoesthesia) is one such cause. Many symptoms arise from dysphagia. To date, there have been several reports indicating a possible relationship between zinc deficiency and dysphagia-associated pneumonia, but there has been no report studying the relationship between zinc deficiency and laryngeal hypoesthesia. In this study, we proposed that zinc plays an important role in laryngeal sensation, apart from taste, and evaluated the relationship between zinc deficiency and laryngeal hypoesthesia.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^9be072bb]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Due to involvement of zinc in various immune functions, zinc deficiency results in:

Reduced activity of immune cells like impaired phagocytosis.
Decreased critical neutrophil functions.
Weakened natural killer cell function.
Reduced lymphocyte number and activation.
Diminished antibody production.
Imbalanced T helper cells cytokine secretion with decreased IFNγ production. IFNs are immunostimulatory cytokines with antiviral activity.
Increased thymic atrophy and consequent risk of infection.

On the other hand, excess of zinc can also impair immune response by inhibiting T–lymphocyte and B–lymphocyte function, reducing intracellular pathogen destruction in macrophages or inducing an overload of regulatory T–cells. This demonstrates that a balanced zinc homeostasis is critical for adequate immune functions.

Furthermore, accurate modulation of the inflammatory response is required for achieving an adequate antiviral immune response. Hereby, zinc is crucial to counteract excessive inflammatory reactions by improving control of regulatory transcriptional factor, nuclear factor–κB (NF–κB), resulting in a reduced production of pro–inflammatory cytokines. Zinc signals can increase intracellular levels of zinc finger protein A20, which inhibits activation of NF–κB through a negative feedback loop, downregulating proinflammatory factors as well. Zinc may also limit excessive inflammatory response by modulating regulatory T–cell functions.

Moreover, zinc has proven direct antiviral activity towards a wide variety of viruses; enhancing antiviral immunity. Zinc deficiency results in a compromised immune system along with reduced zinc availability for direct antiviral action, increasing susceptibility for viral infections. Hence, zinc–deficient populations are more likely to acquire pneumoniaand viral infections as documented for hepatitis C and HIV. Some studies suggest that zinc may also improve antibacterial immune response to Streptococcus Pneumoniae, which can provoke coinfection in viral pneumonia. In addition, the anti–inflammatory effects of zinc also aid to limit tissue damage in case of pneumonia and decrease the risk of sepsis.

The increased knowledge about the role of zinc in viral immunity has resulted in clinical studies, showing evident therapeutic effect of zinc supplementation in viral infections like common coldand herpes simplex. Presently, zinc is recommended by WHO as first–line treatment, with oral rehydration solution, for acute gastroenteritis in children because of its clinically proven efficacy to reduce diarrhoea. The question is to what extent zinc is also involved in antiviral immunity in case of COVID–19.

Collectively, we report a case with AE-like skin lesions. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of characteristics such as preterm birth, low birth weight, a history of PN, hypozincemia, the absence of SLC39A4 gene mutations, a marked response to zinc therapy, and the absence of recurrence following the withdrawal of zinc supplementation, the premature infant was ultimately diagnosed with TSZD. By reporting this case, we emphasize the challenges associated with distinguishing TSZD from AE, and recommend that routine testing for the SLC39A4 gene be performed for patients with AE-like dermatitis. When the SLC39A4 gene test is not conducted, we underscore the necessity of a long-term follow-up to observe whether zinc deficiency-related symptoms reappeared after zinc discontinuation, in order to draw definitive diagnostic conclusions.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^6cb6a61d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the best diagnosis?
A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
B. Zinc deficiency
C. Lyell syndrome
D. Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
E. Generalized bullous impetigo

Answers:
A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by the release of 2 exotoxins (epidermolytic toxins A and B). It usually begins with fever within 24 to 48 hours. Large blisters appear, followed by tissue-paper–like wrinkling of the skin. In our case, the patient presented with this condition for 3 weeks, but the skin bacterial culture was negative.
B. Zinc deficiency – Incorrect. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, genetic, autosomal recessive disease characterized by typical periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea. Because the patient's plasma zinc level was normal, this diagnosis was excluded.
C. Lyell syndrome – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis rarely affects children and adolescents (ie, only 20% in the United States). The medications most frequently prescribed for treating toxic epidermal necrolysis are phenobarbital, carbamazepine, piroxicam, aminopenicillins, and allopurinol. Our patient did not take any medication prior to the onset of the disease.
D. MMA – Correct. MMA is a rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid caused by a deficiency of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MUT) that catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonic-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which requires vitamin B12. The main manifestations include lethargy, hypotonia, vomiting, seizures, and respiratory distress. Patients present with superficial scalded skin over erythematous underlying tissues, stomatitis, cheilitis, and alopecia. These cutaneous manifestations are called acrodermatitis metabolica entheropathica–like syndrome.
E. Generalized bullous impetigo – Incorrect. The general condition of our patient was altered, which is not the case in patients with generalized bullous impetigo. In fact, these patients have no systemic symptoms and normal laboratory findings (hemogram, liver and renal function tests, and urinalysis).

### Zinc homeostasis and immunity [^2118d28b]. Trends in Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential trace element for the immune system, and zinc deficiency compromises the function of primarily T cells but also of several other immune cells. Recently, zinc homeostasis has been demonstrated to affect dendritic cells, in particular the involvement of zinc transport proteins during lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of major histocompatibility complex proteins and co-stimulatory molecules. This adds to our understanding of the immunomodulatory potential of zinc and highlights its significance for immune function.
