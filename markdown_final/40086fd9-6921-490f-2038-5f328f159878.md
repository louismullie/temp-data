## Question

Is unsaturated fat good for HLD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether unsaturated fat is good for HLD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "HLD" likely refers to in this context. Then, I should verify the core diet–heart mechanisms, especially how replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat affects LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular outcomes. Next, I will review guideline positions and quantify the magnitude of benefit from controlled trials. After that, I should consider nuances like HDL effects, triglycerides, and omega-3s. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable answer with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "HLD" is not a standard lipid acronym. Wait, let me verify the context: given the lipid-focused references and the classic diet–heart questions, the user almost certainly means HDL cholesterol, i.e., high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, sometimes colloquially called "good cholesterol", and the question is whether unsaturated fats improve HDL or are otherwise beneficial for the lipid profile and cardiovascular risk.

> Next, I should review the mechanistic rationale. Unsaturated fats, both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, lower LDL cholesterol when they replace saturated fats, and this LDL-lowering is causally linked to reduced atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Importantly, when saturated fat is replaced with unsaturated fat rather than carbohydrate, HDL tends to be maintained or modestly increased, whereas low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets often lower HDL and raise triglycerides, which is less favorable for cardiometabolic risk [^11523USy] [^113ick6q] [^115HQJPs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should quantify the magnitude. Controlled feeding trials show that replacing 5% of energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat lowers LDL by about 9–10 mg/dL and non-HDL by about 11 mg/dL, while replacement with monounsaturated fat lowers LDL by about 8 mg/dL and non-HDL by about 8.5 mg/dL. These changes are larger than when saturated fat is replaced with carbohydrate, which still lowers LDL but can worsen HDL and triglycerides, especially in insulin-resistant individuals [^114g6XxN] [^111TsbAf] [^113ick6q].

> I will now examine clinical outcomes, because lipid changes are only proxies. Large randomized trials and meta-analyses indicate that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fat, reduces cardiovascular events by roughly 17–30% depending on the analysis and population, with the most consistent signal when saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fat rather than carbohydrate or protein. This aligns with longstanding epidemiologic data and underpins current guidelines [^11523USy] [^11523USy] [^1113dXss].

> But wait, what about HDL specifically? Does unsaturated fat "raise" HDL enough to matter? Let me check. Compared with saturated fat, unsaturated fats generally have a smaller HDL-raising effect, and some studies show HDL remains stable or increases modestly when saturated fat is replaced with unsaturated fat, whereas high-carbohydrate replacements tend to lower HDL. In postmenopausal women, omega-3 supplementation has been shown to modestly increase HDL by about 2 mg/dL, though this is not universal across all populations or formulations [^113ick6q] [^115UsJXZ].

> I should confirm guideline convergence to ensure consistency. Major societies align on replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats to improve the lipid profile and reduce ASCVD risk: the AHA/ACC, WHO, and National Lipid Association all recommend limiting saturated fat and emphasizing mono- and polyunsaturated fats within overall healthy dietary patterns such as Mediterranean or DASH, with particular attention to avoiding trans fats and refined carbohydrates [^1145SNsh] [^1125URUr] [^115hWgxi].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances. In insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome, replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat improves the atherogenic dyslipidemia pattern (high triglycerides, low HDL, small dense LDL) more than simply cutting total fat and increasing refined carbs. For severe hypertriglyceridemia, high-dose omega-3s (EPA ± DHA) are guideline-supported to lower triglycerides, though effects on HDL are variable and LDL may rise slightly with DHA, so therapy should be individualized and monitored [^113ick6q] [^112g2Ubw] [^116yAa3o].

> I should double-check the practical translation. "Good for HDL" in this context means that unsaturated fats help maintain or modestly increase HDL relative to the scenario where saturated fat is replaced by refined carbohydrates, and they unequivocally improve the overall lipid risk profile by lowering LDL and non-HDL, which drives reductions in cardiovascular events. Therefore, advising patients to replace butter, lard, and fatty red meats with oils like olive, canola, soybean, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish is evidence-based and beneficial for HDL in the broader lipid context [^11523USy] [^1145SNsh] [^1125URUr].

> Final answer: Yes, unsaturated fats are good for HDL in the sense that when they replace saturated fats, HDL is generally preserved or modestly increased, whereas low-fat, high-carbohydrate replacements tend to lower HDL. More importantly, unsaturated fats substantially improve the overall lipid profile by lowering LDL and non-HDL, which translates into fewer cardiovascular events, so emphasizing unsaturated fats is a key, guideline-endorsed strategy for dyslipidemia management and cardiovascular risk reduction [^113ick6q] [^11523USy] [^1145SNsh].

---

Unsaturated fats are **beneficial for hyperlipidemia** because they lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while maintaining or modestly increasing HDL cholesterol [^114g6XxN] [^113ick6q]. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats — especially polyunsaturated fats — **reduces cardiovascular risk** [^11523USy] and is recommended by major guidelines for dyslipidemia management [^1145SNsh] [^1125URUr]. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats also lower triglycerides and are indicated for hypertriglyceridemia [^112g2Ubw] [^1154fSJQ]. Unsaturated fats should be emphasized within a heart-healthy dietary pattern that limits saturated and trans fats [^1145SNsh] [^1125URUr].

## Effects of unsaturated fats on lipid profile

Unsaturated fats improve the lipid profile by **lowering LDL cholesterol and triglycerides** while maintaining or modestly increasing HDL cholesterol [^114g6XxN] [^113ick6q]. The magnitude of LDL lowering is greatest with polyunsaturated fats, followed by monounsaturated fats, and then carbohydrates [^114g6XxN] [^111eZEMT].

| **Lipid parameter** | **Effect of unsaturated fats** |
|-|-|
| LDL cholesterol | Significant reduction (≈10 mg/dL with 5% energy substitution) [^114g6XxN] [^111TsbAf] |
| Triglycerides | Reduction, especially with omega-3 PUFAs [^111MESKJ] [^112cZ4zB] |
| HDL cholesterol | Maintained or modestly increased [^113ick6q] [^112BMjDu] |

## Clinical evidence supporting unsaturated fats in hyperlipidemia

Robust evidence supports replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats to improve lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular events [^117L17Y6] [^11523USy]. The Cochrane review found that reducing saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats **reduced cardiovascular events by 17%** [^117L17Y6]. The PREDIMED trial showed that Mediterranean diets high in unsaturated fats reduced cardiovascular events and improved lipid profiles [^116uMqxy].

---

## Comparison with other dietary fats

Compared with saturated and trans fats, unsaturated fats have **more favorable effects** on lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk [^11523USy] [^11268KZh]. Saturated fats raise LDL cholesterol and increase cardiovascular risk, whereas trans fats raise LDL, lower HDL, and increase cardiovascular risk [^11268KZh] [^1128QvPR]. Unsaturated fats, in contrast, lower LDL and triglycerides without adversely affecting HDL [^114g6XxN] [^113ick6q].

---

## Specific unsaturated fatty acids and their effects

- **Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)**: Lower LDL cholesterol and maintain HDL cholesterol; found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts [^114g6XxN] [^113ick6q].
- **Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)**: Include omega-3 and omega-6 fats; omega-3s significantly lower triglycerides and have anti-inflammatory effects [^111MESKJ] [^112cZ4zB].
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: EPA and DHA lower triglycerides by 20–30% and are recommended for hypertriglyceridemia [^112g2Ubw] [^112cZ4zB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines recommend replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats for dyslipidemia management:

- **AHA/ACC**: Emphasize replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats to lower LDL and reduce ASCVD risk [^1145SNsh] [^1133AtG9].
- **WHO**: Recommends reducing saturated fats to < 10% of total energy and replacing with unsaturated fats [^1125URUr] [^116VwbT7].
- **National Lipid Association**: Recommends < 7% of energy from saturated fats, replaced by unsaturated fats [^115hWgxi] [^114ZQbmy].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

Unsaturated fats are generally safe, but **omega-3s at high doses (> 4 g/day) can increase bleeding risk** and atrial fibrillation risk [^116PeuTM]. Excessive intake of omega-6 fats without omega-3s may promote inflammation, though evidence is mixed [^113ZaYSi] [^1111uakc]. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia should receive omega-3s under medical supervision [^112g2Ubw].

---

## Practical dietary recommendations

- **Replace saturated fats**: Use unsaturated fats (olive, canola, sunflower, soybean oils) instead of butter, lard, or palm oil [^1145SNsh] [^1125URUr].
- **Increase omega-3 intake**: Eat fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines) 2–3 times weekly or use omega-3 supplements if needed [^114qac5t] [^112cZ4zB].
- **Limit trans fats**: Avoid processed foods with partially hydrogenated oils [^111UXJ9X] [^111eZEMT].
- **Balance omega-6 and omega-3**: Maintain a ratio of about 4:1 to 2:1 for optimal health [^notfound].

Unsaturated fats are **beneficial for hyperlipidemia** because they lower LDL and triglycerides while maintaining HDL, and they are recommended by major guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk [^114g6XxN] [^1145SNsh].

### Dietary guidelines for Americans-Eat less fat… [^115cc5nC]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans were created by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and were updated in 2016. The guidelines are intended to help Americans make healthier food and beverage choices. This is important because 2 of every 3 Americans are either overweight or obese, and obesity is one of the most important causes of preventable diseases like heart attack and stroke. A summary of these guidelines was published in the February 2, 2016, issue of JAMA. What Are "Saturated Fats". Saturated fats are found in red meat, sausage, and bacon; butter; pastries; and full-fat dairy products; they tend to be solid at room temperature. Diets high in saturated fats can raise total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. When cholesterol is too high, risk of developing heart disease increases.

Research suggests that by replacing sources of saturated fat such as red meat with sources of unsaturated, heart-healthy fats like fish and olive oil, you may be able to lower your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. The Dietary Guidelines The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting intake of saturated fats to 10% of total daily calories and, when possible, replacing foods high in saturated fats with foods high in unsaturated fats. Tips for limiting intake of saturated fats include Focus on heart-healthy fats. Your goal should be to replace sources of saturated fats in your diet with sources of heart-healthy fats, like polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The following foods are sources of heart-healthy fats. Learn how to spot saturated fats. Look for saturated fats on the "Nutrition Facts" label of a food product. If a food has more than 5 g of saturated fat per serving, consider it high in saturated fat.

Eat these types of foods sparingly or search for lower-saturated-fat alternatives. Also, look at the ingredient list. Avoid foods with the words "hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils"; these are also sources of saturated fats. Be careful of "low-fat" products. Many low- or reduced-fat products replace fats with refined carbohydrates and added sugars. Be sure to read the "Nutrition Facts" label and ingredient list to identify low-fat products that are high in carbohydrates or sugar. Even though they are low in saturated fat, these products can be high in calories and should be avoided.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^111eZEMT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Dietary saturated and unsaturated fatty acids — Health authority recommendations emphasize reducing dietary SFA intake and replacing with other nutrients, particularly unsaturated fatty acids with emphasis on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and substitution with PUFAs produces the largest reductions, followed by MUFAs, and then carbohydrates. Not all SFAs are equally potent for increasing LDL-C; lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids (12–16 carbons) raise LDL-C and Apo B. Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are atherogenic, with each 1% of energy from TFAs raising LDL-C by ∼1.5 mg/dL compared with carbohydrates and, to a somewhat greater extent, compared with MUFAs and PUFAs. Consumer guidance notes it is desirable for foods to have 0 g of TFAs and < 50% of total fat as SFAs, and regulatory context states that in 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled partially hydrogenated oils are not "generally recognized as safe" and are no longer allowed for use by manufacturers.

### Saturated fats and cardiovascular health: current evidence and controversies [^115SeErd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

A diet high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) is a suspected contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, in large part because of an effect to raise the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Most dietary guidance from health authorities advocates limiting intake of SFA, particularly for people with clinical ASCVD, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. However, recent reviews have highlighted controversies regarding SFA intake and cardiovascular health. This brief editorial commentary includes a discussion of the evidence regarding SFA intake and cardiovascular health, outlines gaps in the available evidence, and proposes tentative conclusions based on what is known today about SFA consumption and ASCVD risk. Results from observational studies demonstrate that dietary patterns with lower average intakes of SFA are associated with favorable cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, although the number of randomized controlled trials testing the effects of reducing SFA intake on ASCVD outcomes is limited, the available evidence supports the view that replacing SFA with unsaturated fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids, may reduce ASCVD risk. Beyond raising LDL-C and atherogenic lipoprotein particle concentrations, higher intakes of SFA may influence pathways affecting inflammation, cardiac rhythm, hemostasis, apolipoprotein CIII production, and high-density lipoprotein function. However, the impacts of these effects on ASCVD risk remain uncertain. In the authors' view, the totality of the evidence supports the current recommendation to limit SFA intake to < 10% of total daily energy for the general healthy population and further (e.g., to 5–6% of total daily energy) for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease [^117L17Y6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally, it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats eliminated from the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein.

Objectives

To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid) on 15 October 2019, and searched Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 17 October 2019.

Selection Criteria

Included trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) compared with higher saturated fat intake or usual diet; 4) not multifactorial; 5) in adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 6) intervention duration at least 24 months; 7) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. We performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses, funnel plots and GRADE assessment.

Main Results

We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (16 comparisons, 56,675 participants), that used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on reducing saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98, 12 trials, 53,758 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I² = 67%, GRADE moderate-quality evidence). Meta-regression suggested that greater reductions in saturated fat (reflected in greater reductions in serum cholesterol) resulted in greater reductions in risk of CVD events, explaining most heterogeneity between trials. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 56 in primary prevention trials, so 56 people need to reduce their saturated fat intake for ~four years for one person to avoid experiencing a CVD event. In secondary prevention trials, the NNTB was 53. Subgrouping did not suggest significant differences between replacement of saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate, and data on replacement with monounsaturated fat and protein was very limited. We found little or no effect of reducing saturated fat on all-cause mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; 11 trials, 55,858 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 10 trials, 53,421 participants), both with GRADE moderate-quality evidence. There was little or no effect of reducing saturated fats on non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07) or CHD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16, both low-quality evidence), but effects on total (fatal or non-fatal) myocardial infarction, stroke and CHD events (fatal or non-fatal) were all unclear as the evidence was of very low quality. There was little or no effect on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses, diabetes diagnosis, HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides or blood pressure, and small reductions in weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and BMI. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this updated review suggest that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years causes a potentially important reduction in combined cardiovascular events. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate appear to be useful strategies, while effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat are unclear. The reduction in combined cardiovascular events resulting from reducing saturated fat did not alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk, but greater reduction in saturated fat caused greater reductions in cardiovascular events.

### Public health guidelines should recommend reducing saturated fat consumption as much as possible: YES [^1128QvPR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on decades of research, there is strong evidence that supports ongoing dietary recommendations to decrease intakes of SFAs and, more recently, to replace SFAs with unsaturated fat, including PUFAs and MUFAs. Epidemiologic research has shown that replacement of SFAs with unsaturated fat, but not refined carbohydrate and added sugars, is associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease events and death. There is much evidence from controlled clinical studies demonstrating that SFAs increase LDL cholesterol, a major causal factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. When each (nonprotein) dietary macronutrient isocalorically replaces SFA, the greatest LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect is seen with PUFA, followed by MUFA, and then total carbohydrate. New research on full-fat dairy products high in saturated fat, particularly fermented dairy foods, demonstrates some benefits for cardiometabolic diseases. However, compared with food sources of unsaturated fats, full-fat dairy products increase LDL cholesterol. Thus, current dietary recommendations to decrease SFA and replace it with unsaturated fat should continue to the basis for healthy food-based dietary patterns.

### Randomized clinical trials on the effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate on plasma lipoproteins and cardiovascular disease [^113A7iZm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Several dietary approaches have reduced cardiovascular events in randomized clinical trials. Replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat prevented coronary events in men, and a Mediterranean diet and fatty fish improved survival. None of these trials had much impact on total fat intake but rather increased vegetable oils, n-3 fatty acids, or many other plant foods or nutrients that are linked to coronary prevention. The reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by these dietary therapies compare favorably with drug treatments for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Improvement in blood lipid risk factors is an important mechanism to explain the results of trials of unsaturated fats. When saturated or trans unsaturated fats are replaced with monounsaturated or n-6 polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils, primarily low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreases. The LDL to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio decreases. When carbohydrates are used to replace saturated fats, in a low-fat diet, LDL and HDL decrease similarly, and the ratio is not improved; triglycerides increase as well when carbohydrate increases, except when low glycemic index foods are used. The n-3 polyunsaturated fats in fish oils suppress cardiac arrhythmias and reduce triglycerides, but they have little effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol levels. The theme should be that diet has benefits that come directly from foods, as well as from the reduction in saturated fats, cholesterol, meats, and fatty dairy foods. It is likely that many diets could be designed that could prevent CVD. This potential diversity is crucial for engaging the diverse cultures and tastes of people worldwide in cardiovascular disease prevention.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^115b3UcW]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

General principles for a healthy lifestyle — Recommended macronutrient ranges for adults are 45–65% of energy from carbohydrate, 10–35% from protein, and 20–35% of energy from fat, and the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's Scientific Report recommended removal of the upper limit for dietary fat to allow greater flexibility, particularly with regard to reducing intakes of cholesterol-raising (12–16 carbon saturated and trans unsaturated) fatty acids and refined grains and sugars.

### Effects of lifestyle interventions on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^111brZeX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

This review summarizes intervention studies that evaluated the effects of lifestyle behaviors on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Current diet and lifestyle recommendations beneficially affect HDL-C. Individual lifestyle interventions that increase HDL-C include: a healthful diet that is low (7–10% of calories) in saturated fat and sufficient in unsaturated fat (15–20% of calories), regular physical activity, attaining a healthy weight, with moderate alcohol consumption, and cessation of cigarette smoking. Combining a healthy diet with weight loss and physical activity can increase HDL-C 10% to 13%. When combined with interventions that beneficially affect other cardiovascular disease risk factors, this increase in HDL-C is expected to contribute to a overall reduction in cardiovascular disease risk.

### Does variation in serum LDL-cholesterol response to dietary fatty acids help explain the controversy over fat quality and cardiovascular disease risk? [^114uZn9o]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Controversy over fat quality and cardiovascular disease risk stems from a series of meta-analyses of prospective cohort and randomised intervention trials, which found little evidence for a significant relationship between the intake of saturated fat and disease endpoints. Possible explanations for these null findings include difficulties inherent in estimating true food intake, the confounding effects of macronutrient replacement and food composition, and marked inter-individual variation in the response of serum LDL-cholesterol. The aim of this narrative review was to present evidence for the existence and origins of variation in serum LDL-cholesterol response to the replacement of dietary saturated fat, and its potential to explain the controversy over the latter. The review provides evidence to suggest that variation in LDL-responsiveness may harbour significant potential to confound the relationship between saturated fat and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, thus undermining the effectiveness of the dietary guideline to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat. It concludes that the identification and application of a simple biomarker of this phenomenon, would make it possible to tailor dietary guidelines to LDL responsive individuals, who stand to gain a greater benefit to their cardiovascular health.

### Recommended dietary pattern to achieve adherence to the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology (AHA / ACC) guidelines: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1113dXss]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACC dietary fats and cardiovascular risk — current evidence supports lowering saturated fat intake and substituting polyunsaturated fats. The page notes that "the totality of the evidence continues to support population-wide recommendations to lower saturated fat intake", and that "There is strong evidence that intake of polyunsaturated fat substituted for saturated fat decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular and all-cause mortality". It adds that substitution studies "clearly demonstrate the benefits of replacing SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids", and that "although dairy fat may be slightly less harmful than other food sources of saturated fat, it is far less beneficial than plant-based fats, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids". The Dietary Guidelines for Americans "focuses on healthy foods and eating patterns while acknowledging the detrimental effects of SFAs, sodium, and added sugars by recommending reduced intakes", and this report provides "guidance for reducing food sources of SFAs and replacing those calories with unsaturated fatty acids from plant-based oils".

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^11268KZh]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Trans unsaturated fatty acids (trans fats) are an example of a fatty acid category whose effects on lipid biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk are consistent with their association with cardiovascular disease events in prospective cohort studies. When substituted for other macronutrients, these fatty acids, such as those in industrially produced hydrogenated oils, have been shown to increase levels of LDL cholesterol and the number of atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL and very low density lipoproteins), while also increasing triglycerides and reducing HDL cholesterol and LDL particle size.

To complicate the relation further, dietary fatty acid composition may affect the risk of cardiovascular disease independently of these lipid biomarkers, specifically through the effects on inflammation, endothelial function, thrombosis, ventricular arrhythmias, and blood pressure. However, as reviewed recently, insufficient evidence exists to draw firm conclusions about the effects of fatty acid type on these factors (fig 1).

Fig 1
Diet-heart hypothesis and current understanding. HDL: high density lipoprotein, HDLc: high density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL: low density lipoprotein

Finally, consideration must be given to the role of personal factors that may alter the effect of dietary fat on LDL cholesterol and other lipids. For example, evidence from clinical trials suggests that saturated fat may have little effect on LDL cholesterol levels in people with obesity. Moreover, the possibility of differing effects of dietary fats on lipids in racial and ethnic subgroups has not been systematically evaluated.

### Lipidome changes due to improved dietary fat quality inform cardiometabolic risk reduction and precision nutrition [^114kSYZc]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for approximately 20 million (34%) global deaths annually. In addition, type 2 diabetes (T2D) substantially contributes to global noncommunicable disease burden and premature mortality, primarily through its vascular complications. Therefore, reductions in cardiometabolic disease (that is, CVD and T2D) incidence yield substantial societal benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued dietary guidelines that advocate for reducing saturated fats while increasing unsaturated fats to prevent cardiometabolic diseases, in line with evidence synthesis efforts and national guidelines that emphasize the importance of the type and quality of fats in the habitual diet.

However, current controversies concerning the role of dietary fat in cardiometabolic health center on the potential metabolic benefits of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) versus the merits of reducing saturated fat intake. For example, dairy products are high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), and yet observational data indicate that their relation to cardiometabolic risk may be neutral or possibly beneficial, especially when compared to low levels of these foods or foods that are high in refined carbohydrates. The specific effect of replacing SFAs from animal sources with plant-based unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in the context of a moderately high-fat diet on cardiometabolic risk, including T2D and CVD, is still unclear. Given the complex, long-term nature of dietary impacts on health, definitive endpoint trials remain elusive.

Some populations appear to be especially vulnerable to the negative health impacts of specific diets. The interplay of genetics, physiological traits and diet influences lipid metabolism and cardiometabolic disease development –. Therefore, a beneficial dietary fat composition may be especially critical in groups predisposed to dysregulated lipid metabolism.

Clinical lipid markers, like blood lipoproteins and triglycerides, commonly used as surrogates for cardiometabolic disease risk, are affected by dietary fat –. However, recent evidence challenges the traditional view that dietary fat quality influences cardiometabolic health primarily through these standard blood lipid profiles. More complex effects of dietary fat quality on lipoprotein size and composition, as well as the direct involvement of specific lipid compounds in signal transduction, membrane fluidity and immune response, have been demonstrated. Improved markers of metabolic adaptation to dietary fat quality also create opportunities to integrate data from shorter dietary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with long follow-ups and substantial numbers of incident disease cases.

Background

Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats that are lost in the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein. This review is part of a series split from and updating an overarching review.

Objectives

To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 5 March 2014. We also checked references of included studies and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) not multifactorial; 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 5) intervention at least 24 months; 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors working independently extracted participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm, and we performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots.

Main Results

We include 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (17 comparisons, ˜59,000 participants), which used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on how to reduce saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.96, 13 comparisons, 53,300 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I² 65%, GRADE moderate quality of evidence), but effects on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials, 55,858 participants) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 12 trials, 53,421 participants) were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence). There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials, 53,167 participants), but evidence for non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; 9 trials, 52,834 participants) was unclear and there were no clear effects on stroke (any stroke, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 8 trials, 50,952 participants). These relationships did not alter with sensitivity analysis. Subgrouping suggested that the reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies that primarily replaced saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat, and no effects were seen in studies replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate or protein, but effects in studies replacing with monounsaturated fats were unclear (as we located only one small trial). Subgrouping and meta-regression suggested that the degree of reduction in cardiovascular events was related to the degree of reduction of serum total cholesterol, and there were suggestions of greater protection with greater saturated fat reduction or greater increase in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses or blood pressure, while there was some evidence of improvements in weight and BMI.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial. This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115gihQt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — severe and very severe management: For severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Determination and treatment of underlying causes of very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be considered first. Restriction of both saturated and unsaturated dietary fat, particularly at initiation of therapy and in LpL deficiency, assists in lowering triglyceride acutely, and design of the dietary intervention may benefit from input from nutrition specialists; regain of weight loss might exacerbate pancreatitis risk.

Table 5 — Isocaloric replacement of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with unsaturated fats or carbohydrates predicts lipid changes as follows: replacing 5% of energy from SFAs with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) changes low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by -10.5 mg/dL, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by -11.0 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) by -5.0 mg/dL; with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), LDL-C by -8.0 mg/dL, non-HDL-C by -8.5 mg/dL, and Apo B by -4.0 mg/dL; and with carbohydrates, LDL-C by -6.5 mg/dL, non-HDL-C by -6.0 mg/dL, and Apo B by -2.0 mg/dL, based on results from 74 controlled feeding trials.

### Fatty acids in cardiovascular health and disease: a comprehensive update [^112PXQvK]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Research dating back to the 1950s reported an association between the consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and risk of coronary heart disease. Recent epidemiological evidence, however, challenges these findings. It is well accepted that the consumption of SFAs increases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas carbohydrates, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) do not. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C increases with SFA intake. Among individuals who are insulin resistant, a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet typically has an adverse effect on lipid profiles (in addition to decreasing HDL-C, it also increases triglyceride and LDL particle concentrations). Consequently, a moderate fat diet in which unsaturated fatty acids replace SFAs and carbohydrates are not augmented is advised to lower LDL-C; compared with a low-fat diet, a moderate-fat diet will lower triglycerides and increase HDL-C. Now, there is some new evidence that is questioning the health benefits of even MUFAs and PUFAs. In addition, in a few recent studies investigators have also failed to demonstrate expected cardiovascular benefits of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids. To clarify the clinical pros and cons of dietary fats, the National Lipid Association held a fatty acid symposium at the 2011 National Lipid Association Scientific Sessions. During these sessions, the science regarding the effects of different fatty acid classes on coronary heart disease risk was reviewed.

### Lipidome changes due to improved dietary fat quality inform cardiometabolic risk reduction and precision nutrition [^11691DuC]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Current cardiometabolic disease prevention guidelines recommend increasing dietary unsaturated fat intake while reducing saturated fats. Here we use lipidomics data from a randomized controlled dietary intervention trial to construct a multilipid score (MLS), summarizing the effects of replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat on 45 lipid metabolite concentrations. In the EPIC-Potsdam cohort, a difference in the MLS, reflecting better dietary fat quality, was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (-32%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): -21% to -42%) and type 2 diabetes (-26%; 95% CI: -15% to -35%). We built a closely correlated simplified score, reduced MLS (rMLS), and observed that beneficial rMLS changes, suggesting improved dietary fat quality over 10 years, were associated with lower diabetes risk (odds ratio per standard deviation of 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98) in the Nurses' Health Study. Furthermore, in the PREDIMED trial, an olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet intervention primarily reduced diabetes incidence among participants with unfavorable preintervention rMLS levels, suggestive of disturbed lipid metabolism before intervention. Our findings indicate that the effects of dietary fat quality on the lipidome can contribute to a more precise understanding and possible prediction of the health outcomes of specific dietary fat modifications.

### Replacement of dietary saturated with unsaturated fatty acids is associated with beneficial effects on lipidome metabolites: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^115tWMwF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reducing dietary SFAs has been proposed as a modifiable dietary strategy to help prevent cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk worldwide. In particular, the replacement of dietary SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) confers a greater benefit than other nutrients (i.e. proteins or carbohydrates) on markers of CVD risk. However, it is unclear whether such cardioprotective effects might stem from UFAs themselves, from reduced intakes of deleterious SFAs, or from a combination of both.

Plasma lipids mostly derive from nutrient intakes, along with lipids stored and/or endogenously synthesized in the liver and adipose tissue. In particular, lipids can be solubilized in plasma by binding with proteins, such as free fatty acids with albumins, or as more complex lipids and lipoproteins. More than 600 lipid molecular species have been identified in plasma using high-throughput analytical methods such as lipidome-wide screenings, which differ in their structures and physiological functions. For instance, glycerolipids are characterized by the presence of a glycerol backbone bonding fatty acids (e.g. in mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols), along with a phosphate-containing polar head in glycerophospholipids. Other plasma lipid classes include sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and ceramides, and sterols, which are important elements to cellular membrane structure. Complex plasma lipid structures, such as LDL or TG, are important in the mechanistic link between diet and CMD risk. Further hypotheses on the involvement of plasma lipid molecular species in cardiometabolic health have been generated, thanks to the growing popularity of high-throughput lipidomics analyses. Nonetheless, little is known on the impact of manipulating dietary fat intakes on the plasma lipidome and how this may mediate the epidemiological associations observed between dietary fat intakes and CMD risk.

### Public health guidelines should recommend reducing saturated fat consumption as much as possible: debate consensus [^112pNaAT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

There is ongoing debate as to whether public health guidelines should advocate reducing SFA consumption as much as possible to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). In considering both sides of this question, we identified a number of points of agreement, most notably that the overall dietary patterns in which SFAs are consumed are of greater significance for cardiometabolic and general health than SFA intake alone. Nevertheless, there remained significant disagreements, centered largely on the interpretation of evidence bearing on 4 major questions: 1) does reducing dietary SFAs lower the incidence of CVD, 2) is the LDL-cholesterol reduction with lower SFA intake predictive of reduced CVD risk, 3) do dietary SFAs affect factors other than LDL cholesterol that may impact CVD risk, and 4) is there a sufficient rationale for setting a target for maximally reducing dietary SFAs? Finally, we identified specific research needs for addressing knowledge gaps that have contributed to the controversies.

Saturated fats and cardiometabolic effects — saturated fat consumption "may impair vascular endothelial function", whereas "unsaturated fats such as omega-3 fatty acids may improve vascular endothelial function"; most studies suggesting saturated fats are unhealthful evaluated "isocaloric substitution for other nutrients". During weight reduction via carbohydrate restricted diets, many patients with pre-obesity/obesity "may experience improvement in fat mass adipose tissue dysfunction and/or improvement or remission in diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia (i.e., triglycerides), and reduced CVD risk factors"; however, in patients with genetic dyslipidemias, carbohydrate restriction, "if excessive or uncontrolled, should prompt replacement of saturated fats with poly or monounsaturated fats and restriction of dietary cholesterol".

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^116uMqxy]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Moving from controversy to consensus

Two related issues have caused the most controversy about the relative roles of saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats and the evidence for making public health recommendations.

Since the 1960s, the evidence has suggested that replacing saturated fats in the diet with polyunsaturated fats reduces the risk of chronic disease and premature death. In practice this means replacing red and processed meat and high fat dairy with fish, nuts, and seeds, and replacing animal fats such as butter and lard with vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower, soy, rapeseed, or olive oils. The PREDIMED study, a large primary prevention randomised controlled trial on people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, reported that increased intake of extra virgin olive oil or nuts with a Mediterranean diet significantly reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease compared with a low fat dietary advice group. However, while the intake of unsaturated fats increased in both the olive oil and nut arms and may therefore have contributed to the clinical outcomes, there was no nutrient substitution for saturated fats and their intake was not reduced compared with the low fat dietary advice group. How this evidence should be interpreted and applied remains controversial.

Since 2000, clinical trials lasting up to two years have suggested that low carbohydrate diets in which total and saturated fat replaces the carbohydrate content of the diet have beneficial effects on overweight as well as on lipid risk factors such as HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (but not LDL cholesterol) and on risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Here, we ourselves disagree on the significance and interpretation of these trials because long term trial evidence is not available, definitions of low carbohydrate vary substantially across studies, and few clinical trial data exist on the incidence of clinical endpoints (see related article in this series on diet and management and prevention of type 2 diabetes).

These controversies arise largely because existing research methods cannot resolve them. In the current scientific model, hypotheses are treated with scepticism until they survive rigorous and repeated tests. In medicine, randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard in the hierarchy of evidence because randomisation minimises the number of confounding variables. Ideally, each dietary hypothesis would be evaluated by replicated randomised trials, as would be done for the introduction of any new drug. However, this is often not feasible for evaluating the role of diet and other behaviours in the prevention of non-communicable diseases.

### Effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on insulin-resistant dyslipoproteinemia-a randomized controlled feeding trial [^115NwHYE]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For nearly a half century, advice to reduce saturated fat intake has been a major focus of dietary guidelines for public health and medical nutrition therapy. This advice is based in part on evidence from clinical trials showing that saturated fat increases plasma LDL cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Replacing saturated with unsaturated fat lowers LDL cholesterol in trials and reduces risk of cardiovascular and total mortality in cohort studies.

Conversely, when saturated fat is replaced by carbohydrate, particularly from processed sources, reducing intake does not decrease risk and can have adverse effects on components of the metabolic syndrome, including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and other risk factors related to insulin resistance. Low-carbohydrate diets, with saturated fat content far exceeding current guidelines, have become popular for diabetes management based on preliminary evidence of efficacy, albeit with concern for the potential of saturated fat to raise LDL cholesterol and consequently CVD risk. However, LDL cholesterol does not capture potentially important diet effects on CVD risk from insulin-resistant dyslipoproteinemia. Indeed, there is broad consensus regarding the need to assess multiple biomarkers beyond LDL cholesterol to clarify the relation between diet and CVD.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects on novel and conventional CVD risk factors of low-, moderate-, and high-carbohydrate diets varying in saturated fat content in a manner reflective of how these diets are typically consumed. We hypothesized that the low-carbohydrate diet would improve lipoprotein insulin resistance (LPIR) score, a metabolic marker that captures incipient effects of insulin resistance on lipoprotein metabolism and has been robustly associated with incident type 2 diabetes and premature coronary heart disease. To enhance dietary adherence, we provided participants with fully prepared meals throughout the study.

Lifestyle interventions — Recommendation 25 (Mediterranean diet) — states that for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), we suggest a dietitian-led Mediterranean diet (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Supporting evidence cited includes a systematic review of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of saturated fat reduction, in which eight RCTs found that reducing saturated fat did not reduce CVD mortality; additional evidence reports that a Mediterranean diet reduced composite cardiovascular (CV) events, stroke, incidence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), myocardial infarction (MI), and CV and all-cause mortality and improved the management of dyslipidemia, and a meta-analysis of 18 studies showed a significant dose-related response linking higher dietary fiber intake to lower coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality. The Mediterranean diet is described as including a high unsaturated fat/saturated fat ratio, a substantial increase in fiber from plant-based foods, and an increased intake of fish.

### Dietary fats and cardiovascular disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^11523USy]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by ≈30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD. This recommended shift from saturated to unsaturated fats should occur simultaneously in an overall healthful dietary pattern such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or the Mediterranean diet as emphasized by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle guidelines and the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Conclusions

In summary, the benefits of a low-fat diet (particularly a diet replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates or Ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids) are severely challenged. Dietary guidelines should assess the totality of the evidence and strongly reconsider their recommendations for replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates or Ω-6 polyunsaturated fats.

### Protective effect of dietary monounsaturated fat on arteriosclerosis: beyond cholesterol [^116zarvK]. Atherosclerosis (2002). Low credibility.

The consumption of diets enriched in monounsaturated fat has been related to a lower rate of coronary heart disease. It is well known that this dietary model decreases LDL-cholesterol plasma levels when replacing a saturated fat enriched diet. For this reason, a high monounsaturated fat diet is now being advocated to prevent cardiovascular disease, especially in Mediterranean countries. However, some expert panels-the Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Coronary Prevention and the International Task Force for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease-recommend replacing dietary saturated fat by complex carbohydrates, limiting the intake of total fat to < 30% of the energy and monounsaturated fat to no more than 10–15% of total calories, reaching a similar effect on LDL-cholesterol plasma levels to a high monounsaturated fat diet. The most appropriate nutritional model to prevent arteriosclerosis should be supported by research into other biological effects of both diets. Therefore, it is interesting to review the non-lipid effect of monounsaturated fat, starting with its influence on other cardiovascular risk factors, such as carbohydrate metabolism and blood pressure. Moreover, substantial evidence of the effect of dietary monounsaturated fat on a wide range of healthy benefits beyond cholesterol, which have been investigated in recent years, such as lipoprotein oxidation, coagulation, fibrinolysis and endothelium, will be discussed. Furthermore, many observational epidemiological studies suggest that a high intake of monounsaturated fat is associated with reduced coronary risk and this will be analyzed in accordance with the clinical evidence to discuss the best dietary model to prevent coronary artery disease.

### Effect of three health diets on cardiovascular markers… [^112BMjDu]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The role of dietary fat, protein, and carbohydrates in lowering lipids and blood pressure has not been satisfactorily clarified. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial demonstrated that a high-carbohydrate diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy can lower blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but it also lowers high-density lipoprotein cholesterol while having a neutral effect on triglycerides. Appel and colleagues conducted a randomized trial to compare the effects of three healthful diets: one emphasizing carbohydrates; the second, protein; and the third, unsaturated fats. Five caloric levels of each diet were provided with the idea that weight would be maintained at stable levels throughout the study. Participants ate their main meal on-site and kept records of their off-site meals.

Primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, with diastolic pressure, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides serving as secondary outcomes. Each feeding period lasted six weeks in the three-period crossover study. Compared with baseline, HDL cholesterol levels decreased in the carbohydrate and protein diets and were unchanged on the unsaturated fat diet. Triglycerides remained the same on the carbohydrate diet but were lower on the unsaturated fat and protein diets. Blood pressure, LDL, and total cholesterol levels were reduced from baseline on all diets. The unsaturated fat and protein diets lowered blood pressure better than the carbohydrate diet. Fewer hypertensive patients remained hypertensive on the protein and unsaturated fat diets than those on the carbohydrate diet. There was a more significant drop in LDL and HDL levels for patients on the protein diet than those on the other two diets.

The unsaturated fat diet increased HDL levels more than the carbohydrate diet. The protein and unsaturated fat diets reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol levels more than the carbohydrate diet. Applying 10-year risk reduction estimates, all diets lowered the risk of coronary heart disease, with the greatest reductions associated with the protein and unsaturated fat diets. The authors conclude that substituting some carbohydrates with protein or monounsaturated fat in healthful diets can improve lipid factors, lower blood pressure, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Cholesterol myths and facts… [^1178VsXU]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Cholesterol can be confusing. Learn answers to common questions about blood cholesterol. Myth: All cholesterol is bad for you. Fact: Some types of cholesterol are essential for good health. Your body needs cholesterol to perform important jobs, such as making hormones and building cells. Cholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. Two types of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout the body: low-density lipoprotein, sometimes called "bad" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein, or "good" cholesterol. When your body has too much LDL cholesterol, it can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque. HDL, or "good" cholesterol, carries cholesterol back to the liver. The liver then flushes it from the body. High levels of HDL cholesterol can lower your risk for heart disease and stroke. As your blood vessels build up plaque over time, the insides of the vessels narrow.

This narrowing can restrict and eventually block blood flow to and from your heart and other organs. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, it can cause angina or a heart attack. Myth: Eating foods with a lot of cholesterol will not make my cholesterol levels go up. Fact: It can be complicated. We know that foods with a lot of cholesterol usually also have a lot of saturated fat. Saturated fats can make your cholesterol numbers higher, so it's best to choose foods that are lower in saturated fats. Foods made from animals, including red meat, butter, and cheese, have a lot of saturated fats. Instead, aim to eat foods with plenty of fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Healthy unsaturated fats, such as avocados, olive oil, and nuts are also recommended. The following people may need statins or other medicines to manage cholesterol levels: People with FH or people with very high levels of "bad" cholesterol.

FH is a genetic condition that causes very high LDL cholesterol levels beginning at a young age. If left untreated, cholesterol levels will continue to get worse. This greatly raises the risk for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke at a young age.

### Effects of dietary fats on blood lipids: a review of direct comparison trials [^113rxufd]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Saturated fat has been demonised as a dietary culprit in heart disease due to its ability to raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) has been regarded as heart healthy due to its ability to lower total and LDL-C. And replacing saturated fat with omega-6 has consistently been found to lower total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. This has been the cornerstone for the belief that the omega-6 PUFA linoleic acid is heart healthy. However, the changes in LDL-C do not take into account the overall changes in the entire lipoprotein profile. For example, saturated fat appears to decrease small-dense LDL (sdLDL) and increase large buoyant LDL. As a high concentration of sdLDL and a low concentration of large buoyant LDL is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), saturated fat may not necessarily increase the risk of CHD. Furthermore, compared with LDL-C, sdLDL (and oxidised LDL) seem to have a greater impact on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

While saturated fat (particularly lauric acid) has been shown to increase total and LDL-C, there is also an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, unsaturated fatty acids have a less prominent effect for increasing HDL-C compared with saturated fat. Thus, it is hard to interpret the overall risk of consuming foods high in saturated fat versus omega-6 PUFA when the former may improve sdLDL and HDL-C, whereas the latter may lower LDL-C but increases LDL susceptibility to oxidation and may lower HDL-C. Indeed, high concentrations of HDL-C are associated with greater protection from coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the overall effect on the lipoprotein profile must be considered when assessing cardiovascular risk with dietary fats and fatty acids.

The effects of replacing saturated fat with omega-6 PUFA on triglycerides (TG), very LDL (VLDL) and HDL are also inconsistent. Thus, it is impossible to know what the overall health impact is when saturated fat is replaced with omega-6 PUFA.

When 1% of energy from carbohydrates is replaced by 1% of energy from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), triglycerides are lowered by 1.7 mg/dL; when PUFAs are the replacement nutrient, triglycerides are lowered by 2.3 mg/dL.

Preintervention characteristics and cardiometabolic disease risk markers in the subset of participants from the DIVAS randomized controlled trial (n = 113).

Upon inclusion, participants were randomly allocated to one of the three 16-wk isoenergetic, high-fat (36% TE) dietary intervention arms varying in proportions of SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs: a SFA-rich diet (target SFA:MUFA:n-6 PUFA ratio = 17:11:4% TE), a MUFA-rich diet (target SFA:MUFA:n-6 PUFA ratio = 9:19:4% TE), or a MUFA/PUFA-rich diet (target SFA:MUFA:n-6 PUFA ratio = 9:13:10% TE). The analysis of 4-d weighed diet diaries at baseline and postintervention confirmed participants' compliance and the successful isoenergetic exchange of dietary fat in each dietary intervention arm. In addition, measurements for a wide range of CMD risk markers were performed at baseline (Table 1) and postintervention.

Pragmatic, evidence-based dietary studies — studies of dietary interventions are problematic because of adherence and monitoring issues, and although the best study would be carefully monitored by a dietitian it would be impractical to have every patient pursue a dietitian-led plan; replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears beneficial in men only, there is more evidence for the Mediterranean diet which includes a high level of plant-based foods and low levels of saturated fats, and more study of replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats alone, large pragmatic dietary studies, and a whole-food, plant-based dietary strategy for CVD risk reduction in primary prevention is needed.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116F88Hn]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fat intake limits — including hypercholesterolemia and infancy: Within appropriate age- and gender-based requirements and in normal children and in children with hypercholesterolemia, intake of total fat can be safely limited to 25 to 30 percent of total calories, saturated fat intake limited to 7–10 percent of calories, and dietary cholesterol limited to 300 mg/d, with this composition shown under qualified nutritionists to result in lower TC and LDL–C levels, less obesity, and less insulin resistance (Grade A). Under similar conditions and with ongoing follow-up, these levels of fat intake may have similar effects starting in infancy (Grade B), and fats are important to infants due to their role in brain and cognitive development; fat intake in infants younger than 12 months of age should not be restricted without medical indication. The remaining 20 percent of fat intake should comprise a combination of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (Grade D), and intake of trans fat should be limited as much as possible (Grade D).

### Public health guidelines should recommend reducing saturated fat consumption as much as possible: NO [^113DW5uL]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposition that dietary SFAs should be restricted to the maximal extent possible (e.g., to achieve approximately half of current consumption) is based primarily on observational and clinical trial data that are interpreted as indicating a benefit of such limitation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Further support is believed to derive from the capacity of SFAs to raise LDL cholesterol, and the evidence that LDL-cholesterol lowering reduces CVD incidence. Despite their apparent merit, these arguments are flawed. In fact, although it is possible that dietary intake of SFAs has a causal role in CVD, the evidence to support this contention is inconclusive. Moreover, other considerations argue against a guideline focused primarily on limiting SFA intake, including the heterogeneity of individual SFAs, the likelihood of clinically meaningful interindividual variation in response to SFA reduction, the potential for unintended health consequences of population-wide promotion of severe restriction, and the critical differences in health impacts among individual SFA-containing foods.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1154YVDS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of the new model reveals a nearly linear response at doses greater than 2 g/d of DHA + EPA supplementation in overall and subgroup analyses in the performance of triglyceride and non‐HDL‐C reduction. Individuals who are at high risk for developing CVD, such as those with hyperlipidemia and overweight/obesity, may be more responsive to the beneficial impacts of ω3 PUFA. This research helps improve our understanding of the moderate effects of omega‐3 fatty acids on lipid reduction and CVD prevention.

### Overblown claims [^115m2iac]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Decision support for practitioners

To help clinicians and other healthcare providers navigate the often contradictory and confusing voices on effective nutrition assessment and intervention practices, BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health will present a series of concise answers to important nutrition questions. The first of these vignettes has now been compiled by Kris-Etherton and colleaguesconcerning the current state of evidence about the known harms from high intake of palmitate and other blood cholesterol-raising saturated fats. They illustrate that the currently available evidence strongly supports that people with high consumption of such saturated fats have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This high risk can be reduced when some of the saturated fat is replaced by unsaturated fats, but not by replacing it with sugars or other carbohydrates. While it continues to be very difficult to change entrenched habits, at least the direction of the desirable change towards lowering saturated fat consumption has been clear for a while.

### Omega-6 fats for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1111uakc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-6 fats are polyunsaturated fats vital for many physiological functions, but their effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is debated.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing omega-6 fats (linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)) on CVD and all-cause mortality.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher versus lower omega-6 fat intake in adults with or without CVD, assessing effects over at least 12 months. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished studies. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and potential adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate omega-6 fat effects from those of other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included trials. We wrote to authors of included studies. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, while sensitivity analyses used fixed-effects and limited analyses to trials at low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence for 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs in 6461 participants who were followed for one to eight years. Seven trials assessed the effects of supplemental GLA and 12 of LA, none DGLA or AA; the omega-6 fats usually displaced dietary saturated or monounsaturated fats. We assessed three RCTs as being at low summary risk of bias. Primary outcomes: we found low-quality evidence that increased intake of omega-6 fats may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.12, 740 deaths, 4506 randomised, 10 trials) or CVD events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15, 1404 people experienced events of 4962 randomised, 7 trials). We are uncertain whether increasing omega-6 fats affects CVD mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.55, 472 deaths, 4019 randomised, 7 trials), coronary heart disease events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17, 1059 people with events of 3997 randomised, 7 trials), major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20, 817 events, 2879 participants, 2 trials) or stroke (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.11, 54 events, 3730 participants, 4 trials), as we assessed the evidence as being of very low quality. We found no evidence of dose-response or duration effects for any primary outcome, but there was a suggestion of greater protection in participants with lower baseline omega-6 intake across outcomes. Additional key outcomes: we found increased intake of omega-6 fats may reduce myocardial infarction (MI) risk (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02, 609 events, 4606 participants, 7 trials, low-quality evidence). High-quality evidence suggests increasing omega-6 fats reduces total serum cholesterol a little in the long term (mean difference (MD) -0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.16, I² = 81%; heterogeneity partially explained by dose, 4280 participants, 10 trials). Increasing omega-6 fats probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body mass index (BMI) MD -0.20 kg/m², 95% CI -0.56 to 0.16, 371 participants, 1 trial, moderate-quality evidence). It may make little or no difference to serum triglycerides (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.21, 834 participants, 5 trials), HDL (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02, 1995 participants, 4 trials) or low-density lipoprotein (MD -0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.14, 244 participants, 2 trials, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-6 fats on cardiovascular health, mortality, lipids and adiposity to date, using previously unpublished data. We found no evidence that increasing omega-6 fats reduces cardiovascular outcomes other than MI, where 53 people may need to increase omega-6 fat intake to prevent 1 person from experiencing MI. Although benefits of omega-6 fats remain to be proven, increasing omega-6 fats may be of benefit in people at high risk of MI. Increased omega-6 fats reduce serum total cholesterol but not other blood fat fractions or adiposity.

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^113RsbzA]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric dyslipidemia — saturated fat guidance and food content specify that for youth older than 2 years with dyslipidemia, the recommended intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) is < 7% of daily caloric intake (approximately 8–20 g/day, depending on the child's caloric needs); use of plant-based, minimally processed foods can help to reduce SFA intake and assist with lowering total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C; it is important to note that coconut oil, while plant-based, is high in SFAs and is not recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet; replacing foods rich in SFAs with foods rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) lowers TC and LDL-C by increasing the number of LDL receptors (LDLR) and increasing LDL clearance from the plasma, and patients should be encouraged to replace foods rich in SFAs with plant- and marine-based foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); tabled SFA content examples per serving include Lentils (1 cup, boiled) 0.1 g/serving, Salmon, wild Atlantic (3 oz, cooked) 1.1 g/serving, Whole milk yogurt, plain (6 oz) 3.6 g/serving, Butter (1 Tbsp) 7.3 g/serving, Bacon (3 oz, cooked) 11.7 g/serving, and Coconut oil (1 Tbsp) 11.8 g/serving.

### Effects of diet composition and insulin resistance status on plasma lipid levels in a weight loss intervention in women [^114r9Ser]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dyslipidemia is a major health concern in the United States as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease that also may increase risk for other comorbidities. 1, 2, 3 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was estimated as of 2012 that 28% of US adults aged > 40 years were on some type of lipid‐lowering medication, and of that population, 93% were using a statin. 4 Although these medications are very effective, they may put patients at risk for drug interactions and undesirable adverse effects. In addition, overweight or obese persons are more likely to present with dyslipidemia than leaner persons. 5 In addition to cardiovascular disease, strong evidence shows that obesity and fat distribution are associated with risk for many types of cancer. 6 There also is compelling evidence that overweight status and obesity influences overall health outcomes and likelihood of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease among those who have been diagnosed with cancer. 7 Weight loss and diet modification are strategies that may reduce risk of cardiovascular and other diseases linked to dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes are the first‐choice therapy recommended to lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels and to improve the lipid profile. 1, 2 Historically, the most common dietary recommendation to reduce risk for cardiovascular disease has been to consume a low‐fat, higher carbohydrate diet. 8 This dietary approach serves to lower the intake of saturated fat, which has had the strongest association with risk of cardiovascular disease; however, dietary patterns that replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat rather than carbohydrate, such as the Mediterranean diet, can substantially reduce cardiovascular disease risk. 9 Furthermore, current evidence suggests that persons who are insulin resistant or who have type 2 diabetes may benefit more from a higher fat, lower carbohydrate diet if those fats are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. 2, 10 For patients with metabolic syndrome, a condition of insulin resistance, replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat rather than carbohydrate and avoiding very low‐fat diets has been recommended to avoid further worsening high triglyceride and low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels. 8 Current dietary guidelines for lowering LDL‐C recommend limiting the intake of saturated fat by adhering to either a higher fat (eg, Mediterranean) or lower fat (eg, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH) dietary pattern. 1

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115NFbB1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Dietary approach for reduction in lipids — USDA 2015 Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat intake to a maximum 10% of total calorie intake and avoiding trans fats by limiting them to as low as possible; trans fats have been repeatedly associated with unfavorable lipid profiles and higher ASCVD risk. Overall, health care providers should recommend diets that are low in saturated and trans fats and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and should choose carbohydrates classified as complex (whole grain, fiber-rich). Evidence shows that a DASH diet lowers LDL compared with a typical American diet, whereas the NHLBI 2013 systematic review reported "no consistent effect on LDL, HDL, or TG levels" from trials of a Mediterranean diet and the USDA systematic review did not reach any conclusion concerning the effect of a Mediterranean diet on blood lipid levels. Recent PREDIMED reports noted potential cardiovascular protective profiles related to lipid particle characteristics after 1 year on a Mediterranean diet, but individuals in both Mediterranean diet arms of PREDIMED showed no significant improvements in hypertriglyceridemia or low HDL levels compared with the low-fat control diet arm.

### Health claim notification unsaturated fatty acids reduce heart disease… [^117LcezW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

On January 24, 2007, the FDA received a notification from Frito-Lay, Inc. submitted pursuant to Section 403 of the FD&C Act) and regarding a health claim for the relationship between dietary substitution of saturated fat with unsaturated fatty acids and reduced risk of heart disease. The following statements from the 1989 NAS report titled Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk listed in the January 24 notification are considered authoritative statements. "Clinical and animal studies provide firm evidence that omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids when substituted for saturated fatty acids result in a lowering of serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and usually also some lowering of HDL cholesterol levels".

"Clinical studies indicate that substitution of monounsaturated for saturated fatty acids results in a reduction of serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol without a reduction in HDL cholesterol. " The claim language proposed by Frito-Lay was modified in the May 11 letter to read as follows: "Replacing saturated fat with similar amounts of unsaturated fats may reduce the risk of heart disease. To achieve this benefit, total daily calories should not increase". It bears noting, however, that the claim is available for use on any food that satisfies the requirements for the claim under Section 403 of the FD&C Act), and is not limited to those listed in the notification. These regulations ensure that health claims that are made on the labels or in the labeling of foods are not false or misleading. Health claims that do not meet these regulations may be considered misleading.

Food labeling that is false or misleading in any particular is deemed to be misbranded under section 403 of the FD&C Act. Also, under 21 CFR 101. 14, a food may not bear a health claim if that food exceeds any of the disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium set out in 21 CFR 101.
14. In regulations authorizing CHD-related health claims, FDA has further required, with limited exceptions.

Unanswered questions and future research

Several questions could not be answered by our review. First, do different sources (for example, animal v plant) and chain lengths (odd v even) of saturated fat have different effects on health, particularly with respect to risk of diabetes? The current evidence reviewed suggests that dairy fats, specifically odd chained saturated fatty acids, might be protective against type 2 diabetes; but, apart from recommendations for broad sources of fatty acids (such as dairy v plant v animal flesh), it is not feasible to separate different types of saturated fats with respect to food choices because the foods contain a combination of several saturated fats. Second, what is the impact of saturated fats consumed in the context of diverse background diets on health? Notably, the association between certain foods and CHD cannot be predicted solely by their content of total saturated fats because individual saturated fats might have different cardiovascular effects, and major food sources of saturated fat contain other constituents that could influence risk of CHD. Third, are there meaningful differences in the choice of polyunsaturated fat — for instance, n-3 or n-6 — that replaces saturated (or trans) fats in the diet? Current evidence suggests that either group of polyunsaturated fats provide similar benefit. Fourth, is the reported protective effect of trans -palmitoleic acid for type 2 diabetes robust, and, if so, does the apparent benefit extend to cardiovascular disease outcomes? Fifth, do threshold levels of ruminant trans fatty acid intakes exist, above which cardiovascular risk increases in a similar fashion to that seen with industrial trans fatty acids? Finally, what should be the "gold" standard for measurement of fatty acid intake? Development of reliable and valid methods of assessing fatty acid intakes in large longitudinal cohort studies with sufficient follow-up to observe clinical events and deaths must remain a priority to improve the quality of the evidence on which dietary advice is based.

### Cardiovascular disease risk of dietary stearic acid compared with trans, other saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids: a systematic review [^113zXzHB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

High stearic acid (STA) soybean oil is a trans-free, oxidatively stable, non-LDL-cholesterol-raising oil that can be used to replace trans fatty acids (TFAs) in solid fat applications.

Objective

The objective was to assess the cardiovascular health effects of dietary STA compared with those of trans, other saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids.

Design

We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical studies that evaluated the relation between STA and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including plasma lipids and lipoproteins, hemostatic variables, and inflammatory markers.

Results

In comparison with other saturated fatty acids, STA lowered LDL cholesterol, was neutral with respect to HDL cholesterol, and directionally lowered the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. STA tended to raise LDL cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol, and increase the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol in comparison with unsaturated fatty acids. In 2 of 4 studies, high-STA diets increased lipoprotein(a) in comparison with diets high in saturated fatty acids. Three studies showed increased plasma fibrinogen when dietary STA exceeded 9% of energy (the current 90th percentile of intake is 3.5%). Replacing industrial TFAs with STA might increase STA intake from 3.0% (current) to approximately 4% of energy and from 4% to 5% of energy at the 90th percentile. One-to-one substitution of STA for TFAs showed a decrease or no effect on LDL cholesterol, an increase or no effect on HDL cholesterol, and a decrease in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol.

Conclusions

TFA intake should be reduced as much as possible because of its adverse effects on lipids and lipoproteins. The replacement of TFA with STA compared with other saturated fatty acids in foods that require solid fats beneficially affects LDL cholesterol, the primary target for CVD risk reduction; unsaturated fats are preferred for liquid fat applications. Research is needed to evaluate the effects of STA on emerging CVD risk markers such as fibrinogen and to understand the responses in different populations.

### Convincing evidence supports reducing saturated fat to decrease cardiovascular disease risk [^114s47MQ]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Medium credibility.

The clinical trial evidence has focused on evaluating replacement of SFA with PUFA. Based on three recent meta-analyses of clinical studies, the debate continues. The first two papers concluded that the evidence does not support current recommendations to replace SFA with PUFA since there was no effect on CHD mortality and total/all-cause mortality. Hamleyalso reported no effect on major CHD events and total CHD events. In contrast, the recent AHA Presidential Advisory on dietary fats and CVDconcluded that 'lowering intake of SFA and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially PUFAs, will lower the incidence of CVD'. This conclusion was based on both epidemiological evidence as well as a meta-analysis of four well-controlled clinical trials, the latter of which demonstrated a 29% reduction in CHD events when SFA was replaced with PUFA. This disagreement reflects the studies included in the meta-analyses. Harcombe et al and Hamleyincluded studies that were excluded by Sacks et al due to methodological concerns (discussed in the AHA Presidential Advisory). Since this debate still continues, it is important to recognise the robust literature that demonstrates that lowering SFA reduces LDL-cholesterol (table 2), an established causal factor in the development of atherosclerosis.

Table 2*†
Predicted effects of macronutrient replacement of dietary saturated fatty acids with PUFA, MUFA and carbohydrate on lipoprotein lipids based on results from controlled feeding trials* Predicted effects* on lipoprotein lipids of replacing 5% of energy from saturated fatty acids with the 5% of energy from the specified dietary component, mg/dL.

The need for rigorous dietary research: learning from the SFA debate

Dietary patterns are comprised of foods and nutrients, and this inter-relationship must be acknowledged in dietary research. A reductionist approach has plagued SFA research and demonstrates the hazards of isolating a single nutrient and failing to account for the overall nutrient composition. This leads to confusion and unintended deleterious consequences (eg, a reduction in fat intake and an increase in refined carbohydrates) and impedes accurate translation of nutrition research. Future epidemiological research requires a more holistic approach to account for macronutrient substitutions. This translational approach favors support of healthy eating patterns and reduces unforeseen adverse effects more common when single nutrient recommendations are issued. Clinical research likewise benefits from dietary interventions that address the total dietary pattern including the influence of replacement foods and nutrients on the outcomes assessed.

Macronutrient replacement of saturated fatty acids — predicted lipid effects: Table 4 summarizes controlled feeding trial data for replacing 5% of energy from saturated fatty acids with a matched quantity of energy from PUFA, MUFA, or carbohydrates. Predicted lipoprotein changes (mg/dL) include for PUFA: LDL-C −9.0 mg/dL, TG −2.0 mg/dL, and HDL-C −1.0 mg/dL. Effects on VLDL-C are estimated by dividing the predicted change in TG by 5, and approximated non-HDL-C changes (LDL-C + TG/5) with this 5% substitution are −9.4, −6.0, and −4.1 mg/dL for PUFA, MUFA, and carbohydrate, respectively. Results are summarized from controlled feeding trials of subjects with average-to-mildly dyslipidemic baseline levels of lipoprotein lipids, and effects may be more pronounced in those with higher baseline values.

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^1174kkNA]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Fat is not just fat

Despite decades of dietary advice that the lower the total fat content, the healthier the diet, researchers and public health authorities now agree that to consider the effect of total fat intake alone on health is meaningless; different types of fats must be considered (box 2).

Box 2
Dietary fats and their food sources

Dietary fats are mostly triglycerides, with each triglyceride molecule containing three fatty acids on a glycerol backbone
The structure and function of dietary fatty acids can vary greatly depending on chain length (6–24 carbon units); number of double bonds — saturated (with no double bonds), monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated; and whether the double bonds are in a cis (same side) or trans (opposite side) position
Polyunsaturated fats with double bonds that are 3 carbon atoms or 6 carbons from the n-terminal end of the fatty acid (n-3 or n-6, respectively) are considered essential — that is, they must be obtained from the diet because they are not synthesised in the body. Both have important structural and physiological functions
Different fatty acids have distinct biochemical properties and can therefore produce different metabolic and physiological effects with different clinical manifestations, such as cardiovascular, neurological, or other

To produce public health guidelines on which foods to eat or avoid to reduce the risk of chronic disease is complicated because dietary fats are typically mixtures of different types of fatty acids. Animal fats, for instance, are the main sources of saturated fats in many modern diets, but some animal fats are higher in monounsaturated fats than saturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils will typically contain both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids in different concentrations. Hence, conclusions about the health effects of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are unlikely to consistently translate to the health effects of the fats, oils, and foods in which those fatty acids are present.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1178RYdN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Despite the enforced lipid‐lowering measures over the past decade, global cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐caused deaths rose by almost 20% from 2010 to 2020. Between 2015 and 2018, in the United States alone, dyslipidemia prevalence ranged from 17% to 38%, determined by either total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) ≥ 130 mg/dL, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL, or high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) < 40 mg/dL.

With the hope of protecting the population with hyperlipidemia from CVD events, high‐intensity statin therapy targeting LDL‐C was recommended for the treatment of blood cholesterol. Another strategy is to lower the triglyceride level or triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein. Supplementation of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is one of the lipid‐lowering approaches. Researchers have long seen ω3 PUFA intake as a potential strategy to address vascular conditions, but there have also been concerns. ω3 PUFAs could reduce serum triglyceride concentration by approximately 15% to 30%, but could not affect or even increase LDL‐C levels. Previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been unable to reveal a significant dose–response relationship. Some aggregated data have brought more uncertainty, rather than a solid conclusion. These past meta‐analyses examined the dose–response relationship using pooled linear meta‐regression, without taking into account the correlations among effects at different dose levels.

Importance of lipid components in the diet-heart hypothesis

As the diet-heart hypothesis evolved in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus shifted from the effect of dietary fat on total cholesterol to LDL cholesterol. However, changes in LDL cholesterol are not an actual measure of heart disease itself. Any dietary intervention might influence other, possibly unmeasured, causal factors that could affect the expected effect of the change in LDL cholesterol. This possibility is clearly shown by the failure of several categories of drugs to reduce cardiovascular events despite significant reductions in plasma LDL cholesterol levels.LDL cholesterol can also be reduced through diet in ways that do not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease; for instance, when saturated fat is replaced by carbohydrates, this lowers LDL cholesterol but also reduces HDL cholesterol and increases triglycerides. In the past, these effects were considered less important as researchers and the pharmaceutical industry focused on the effect of the reduction of LDL cholesterol.

Since the 1980s, studies on the LDL cholesterol biomarker itself and the effects of dietary fats on other biomarkers of disease have revealed a more complicated situation. Researchers now widely recognise the existence of a range of LDL particles with different physicochemical characteristics, including size and density, and that these particles and their pathological properties are not accurately measured by the standard LDL cholesterol assay. Hence assessment of other atherogenic lipoprotein particles (either LDL alone, or non-HDL cholesterol including LDL, intermediate density lipoproteins, and very low density lipoproteins, and the ratio of serum apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1) have been advocated as alternatives to LDL cholesterol in the assessment and management of cardiovascular disease risk. Moreover, blood levels of smaller, cholesterol depleted LDL particles appear more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk than larger cholesterol enriched LDL particles, while increases in saturated fat intake (with reduced consumption of carbohydrates) can raise plasma levels of larger LDL particles to a greater extent than smaller LDL particles. In that case, the effect of saturated fat consumption on serum LDL cholesterol may not accurately reflect its effect on cardiovascular disease risk. While polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats reduce LDL cholesterol levels, their effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors that are associated with lipoprotein particles are less clear. Although uncertainty exists about the causal role, if any, of elevated triglycerides or low HDL cholesterol levels in coronary heart disease, there has been continued interest because of their association with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, and their relevance in global populations. Notably, these lipid markers improve — that is, triglycerides decrease or HDL cholesterol increases — when saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fats replace carbohydrates.

### Dietary fats and cardiometabolic disease: mechanisms and effects on risk factors and outcomes [^115CqdM8]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The effect of dietary fats on cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has generated tremendous interest. Many earlier investigations focused on total fat and conventional fat classes (such as saturated and unsaturated fats) and their influence on a limited number of risk factors. However, dietary fats comprise heterogeneous molecules with diverse structures, and growing research in the past two decades supports correspondingly complex health effects of individual dietary fats. Moreover, health effects of dietary fats might be modified by additional factors, such as accompanying nutrients and food-processing methods, emphasizing the importance of the food sources. Accordingly, the rapidly increasing scientific findings on dietary fats and cardiometabolic diseases have generated debate among scientists, caused confusion for the general public and present challenges for translation into dietary advice and policies. This Review summarizes the evidence on the effects of different dietary fats and their food sources on cell function and on risk factors and clinical events of cardiometabolic diseases. The aim is not to provide an exhaustive review but rather to focus on the most important evidence from randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies and to highlight current areas of controversy and the most relevant future research directions for understanding how to improve the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases through optimization of dietary fat intake.

Omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) — trial and meta-analysis evidence: Harris et al. noted 9 large randomized trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, with 4 positive, 4 neutral, and 1 negative; positive trials (1980s to early 2000s) used EPA and DHA intakes between 0.85 and 1.8 g/day, whereas neutral trials (2010–2012) provided 376 to 840 mg/day of EPA and DHA. Evidence syntheses include five systematic reviews and meta-analyses; two published before 2010 reported benefits in existing CHD, but three published after 2010 did not report benefits. A frequently cited meta-analysis (Rizos et al.) was criticized for using a significance threshold of 0.006 instead of 0.05; without this maneuver, fish oil supplementation significantly reduced risk for cardiac death by 9% [RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98; P = 0.011].

### The impact of dietary interventions on cardiometabolic health [^113ZaYSi]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to SFAs, unsaturated fats improve glycemic control, reduce insulin resistance, and lower T2DM risk. While the cardiometabolic benefits of PUFAs are well-established, particularly for omega-3 PUFAs, some scientists argue that omega-6 PUFAs may be harmful. This concern centers on the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, a precursor to pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic compounds, which may negatively affect glucose metabolism, weight regulation, and eating behavior. However, a pooled analysis of individual-level data from 20 prospective cohort studies across 10 countries found that linoleic acid provides long-term benefits for T2DM prevention, and arachidonic acid was not associated with harm.

Dairy products, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, are notable sources of nutrients and dietary fat. High-fat dairy products have historically been criticized for their saturated fat content and potential CVD risk. However, recent studies suggest a more complex relationship. A systematic review by Giosuè et al. found that moderate dairy consumption does not adversely affect cardiovascular health. While very high milk intake (> 1000 g/day) was linked to increased CVD risk, moderate consumption of fermented milk, butter, and cheese was associated with reduced risk. Cream showed no significant association. Yogurt, in particular, has been consistently linked to lower long-term weight gain and reductions in inflammation. Nonetheless, the evidence surrounding dairy fat and CVD remains mixed, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and achieve consensus.

Similarly, eggs are a topic of debate regarding their cardiovascular impact. Eggs are rich in phospholipids and cholesterol. A study by Dehghan et al. involving 177,000 participants from 50 countries found no significant effect of egg consumption on blood lipid levels or CVD risk. Additionally, a randomized clinical trial by Gálvis et al. demonstrated that consuming two eggs daily did not adversely affect key CVD biomarkers. However, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine has been linked to increased trimethylamine-N-oxide levels, a compound associated with higher CVD risk. More clinical studies with robust patient stratification are needed to clarify the role of eggs in cardiovascular health.

In conclusion, while saturated fats should be limited, emerging evidence suggests that dietary cholesterol, particularly from sources like eggs, may not have the harmful effects previously assumed, especially when consumed in moderation. Current dietary recommendations are shifting from focusing on isolated macronutrients to emphasizing overall dietary patterns, particularly plant-based diets rich in unsaturated fats, which have been associated with improved lipid profiles and reduced blood pressure.

### Low-fat diet redux at WHO [^114WMraT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide dietary guidelines in the late 20th century promoted a low-fat diet, based, in part, on the notion that dietary fat, the most energy dense macronutrient, causes excess weight gain. However, high-quality evidence accumulating since then refute a direct association between dietary fat and adiposity. Moreover, substitution of carbohydrates for unsaturated fat can increase insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease, especially among populations with highly prevalent insulin resistance. In this context, the recent WHO conditional recommendation to carry forward the guidance to limit dietary fat to ≤ 30% seems ill advised and should be reconsidered.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for one-third of all global deaths. Reducing saturated fatty acids (SFA) is a key dietary strategy for lowering CVD risk, based primarily on its cholesterol-raising effects; although for many countries the intake of SFA remain higher than recommended intakes.

SFA are used in the manufacturing of a number of foods and confectionary products, as they provide desirable and complementary attributes and functions, not equalled by unsaturated fats. For example, SFA are more oxidatively stable and contributes significantly more to the texture, flavour, sensory and mouth feel properties of food compared to unsaturated fats. Furthermore, most SFA can be transformed into margarines and shortenings without the need for hydrogenation. This is an important quality as these fats can replace hydrogenated fats, previously used for this purpose, but no longer recognised as safe. Although SFA containing commodity fats and oils, such as palm and palm stearin, are considered better options in terms of reliability of global supply, pricing as well as their overall physico-chemical attributes, they are perceived as undesirable in terms of potential impact on cholesterol metabolism. All SFAs and SFA sources are not equal in their hypercholesterolaemic effects. Yet, meta-analyses investigating effects of dietary fats on lipid profiles have generally pooled studies that used various dietary sources of SFA potentially resulting in inaccurate conclusions. Cholesterolaemic effects may differ depending on the chemical structure of fatty acids within the dietary SFA. Evidence from animal studies show that whilst long-chain SFA esterified to sn 1,3 positions are rapidly cleaved by pancreatic and intestinal lipases and released into the intestine, they are not efficiently absorbed due to the formation of insoluble calcium and magnesium salts and are largely excreted in the faeces. In contrast, the sn 2 fatty acid(s) are absorbed efficiently as monoglycerides and transported to the liver where it may influence cholesterol homeostasis differently compared to when occupying sn −1,3 positions. Limited evidence exists in humans to support the hypothesis that triacylglycerol (TAG) structure might influence lipid metabolism. Original speculation was based on observations that infants fed breast milk, with palmitic acid (PA) predominantly esterified to the sn-2 position (~75%) absorbed fat better compared to formulas based on sn-1,3 -palmitate from palm oil. Although palm olein (PO) is rich in SFA, the sn-2 position is predominantly occupied by unsaturated fatty acids (~87%, oleic acid and linoleic acid), while in animal fats such as lard, the sn-2 position is mainly SFA (about 87%, PA and stearic acid). Hence, even though PO and lard have similar proportions of SFA (43 and 39%, respectively) and unsaturated fatty acids (57 and 56%, respectively), they differ in their positional distribution within the TAG molecule. Comparisons between lard and PO on plasma cholesterol outcomes have, however, been inconsistent. Similarly, a limited number of small intervention studies that compared effects of increased PA in the sn -2 position (using interesterification) to fats with PA in sn-1,3, were unable to show differences in cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, more recent animal and human studies using interesterified fats have assigned an important role for fatty acid(s) occupying the sn2 position for several metabolic outcomes

### Effects of dietary fats on blood lipids: a review of direct comparison trials [^113qU4jt]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, compared with a high-MUFA meal, such as olive oil, a high saturated fat meal from butter or cream seems to have worse overall effects on blood lipids. Despite the fact that omega-6 PUFA lowers LDL, it can also reduce LDL particle size and lower the protective HDL2 potentially increase the risk for CHD. The overall effect on blood lipids for marine omega-3 EPA and DHA seems to be protective due to overall improvements in LDL particle size and density as well as reductions in VLDL, TGs, and increases in HDL.

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA ± DHA) — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have CVD or are at increased risk for CVD and are taking statins, the task force issued a conditional recommendation for the use of EPA after shared decision-making because EPA monotherapy results in a small reduction in MI with some potential adverse effects, whereas in the same population it issued a conditional recommendation against EPA plus DHA due to trivial benefits and moderate adverse effects. Recommendations are grounded in trials evaluating doses of ≥ 1.8 g/day, approaching recommended prescribing doses in the range of 2 to 4 g/day, and should not be applied to doses < 1.8 g/day. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), the task force notes a paucity of evidence and advises shared decision-making when considering EPA monotherapy or EPA plus DHA; no studies evaluated the prevention of pancreatitis in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

### Effect of linoleic acid on ischemic heart disease and its risk factors: a mendelian randomization study [^1153MU1R]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality globally. Lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat has been a mainstay of heart health dietary advice for the last 30 years. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have largely substantiated the cardiovascular benefits of monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil. In contrast, controversy has arisen about the effects of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly linoleic acid (LA) which is a major constituent of widely used polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oils. Over the last half century in the USA, with the shift of dietary fat sources toward polyunsaturated seed oils, mainly soybean oil, dietary LA intake has increased dramatically, and adipose tissue LA has more than doubled.

Observationally, dietary LA intake or serum LA is usually inversely associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and its risk factors, including diabetes, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and blood pressure. However, observational studies are difficult to interpret because of potential confounding by factors, such as socioeconomic position, lifestyle, and health status, as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between co-occurring dietary elements. The cholesterol-lowering effect of LA is well-established; however, the effect of LA on IHD is inconsistent in meta-analyses of RCTs, showing a beneficial effect, or neutral effects, as new analyses of RCTs from many years ago, such as the Sydney Diet Heart Study and the Minnesota Coronary Experiment, have come to light. Recommendations for LA intake in dietary guidelines vary, from less than 4% to up to 10% of energy intake.

### Convincing evidence supports reducing saturated fat to decrease cardiovascular disease risk [^114wzESM]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines and population-based recommendations evolve from research vetted by the scientific community. Healthcare providers require practice guidelines resulting from rigorous review of the totality of evidence. Open discussion/debate among experts is fundamental and encouraged, but blatant disregard for scientific process can lead to confusion and public distrust. A recent example is the controversy among scientists, healthcare professionals and the public about dietary saturated fat (SFA) recommendations to lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Dietary recommendations for SFA from authoritative organisations

More than 60 years ago (in 1957), the American Heart Association (AHA) proposed that modifying dietary fat could reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). This was based on research, including controlled feeding studies, and endpoint measures of blood lipids and blood pressure. In 1980, the first Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended 'avoiding too much SFA'. For decades, research has substantiated this consistent dietary recommendation from authoritative organisations to decrease SFA to reduce CVD risk. Current dietary guidelines for SFA and evidence ratings are summarised in table 1. While the strong evidence to reduce SFA specifically targets decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, it is very much germane to CVD risk reduction.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MESKJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous results provide supportive but not conclusive evidence for the use of omega‐3 fatty acids to reduce blood lipids and prevent events of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the strength and shape of dose–response relationships remain elusive.

Methods and Results

This study included 90 randomized controlled trials, reported an overall sample size of 72 598 participants, and examined the association between omega‐3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, or both) intake and blood lipid changes. Random‐effects 1‐stage cubic spline regression models were used to study the mean dose–response association between daily omega‐3 fatty acid intake and changes in blood lipids. Nonlinear associations were found in general and in most subgroups, depicted as J‐shaped dose–response curves for low‐/high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, we found evidence of an approximately linear dose–response relationship for triglyceride and non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol among the general population and more evidently in populations with hyperlipidemia and overweight/obesity who were given medium to high doses (> 2 g/d).

Conclusions

This dose–response meta‐analysis demonstrates that combined intake of omega‐3 fatty acids near linearly lowers triglyceride and non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride‐lowering effects might provide supportive evidence for omega‐3 fatty acid intake to prevent cardiovascular events.

### Does omega-3 fatty acid supplementation have favorable effects on the lipid profile in postmenopausal women? A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115UsJXZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Menopause is associated with disturbances in the metabolism of lipids. Moreover, during the postmenopausal period, female subjects are more prone to develop dyslipidemia. Omega-3 fatty acids, which exert cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering actions, are commonly recommended in postmenopausal women. However, their effect on serum lipids in this population remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to clarify this research question.

Methods

We systematically searched the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases from their inception until January 3, 2022. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to combine effect sizes.

Findings

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation resulted in a decrease in triglyceride concentrations (weighted mean difference [WMD], -17.8 mg/dL; 95% CI, -26 to -9.6; P < 0.001), particularly in the RCTs that lasted ≤ 16 weeks (WMD, -18.6 mg/dL), when the baseline triglyceride concentrations were ≥ 150 mg/dL (WMD, -22.8 mg/dL), in individuals with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (WMD, -19.3 mg/dL), and when the dose of omega-3 fatty acids was ≥ 1 g/d (WMD, -21.10 mg/dL). LDL-C (WMD, 4.1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.80 to 6.36; P < 0.001) and HDL-C (WMD, 2.1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.97 to 3.2; P < 0.001) values increased. Total cholesterol levels (WMD, -0.15 mg/dL; 95% CI, -4 to 3.74; P = 0.94) remained unchanged after administration of omega-3 fatty acids.

Implications

In postmenopausal women, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride concentrations and a modest elevation in HDL-C and LDL-C levels, whereas this intervention did not affect total cholesterol values.

Recommended nutrition — plant-based and Mediterranean-based diets for chronic coronary disease (CCD) include reducing saturated fat and increasing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and complex carbohydrates; higher dietary fiber intake is associated with improvement in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and with a lower risk of CVD events and all-cause death. For patients at higher CVD risk, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends lowering saturated fatty acids to < 6% of total caloric intake, and a recent Cochrane review of randomized trials that reduced saturated fat intake, altered dietary fats, or both highlighted a 17% reduction of CVD events in patients with CCD; among secondary prevention trials, the number needed to treat for an additional benefit was 53, by lowering saturated fat. Reduction in saturated fatty acids with healthier fat and carbohydrate intake lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which is associated with lower CVD morbidity and mortality, and a meta-analysis supports a dose-response relationship of higher quality carbohydrate intake and lower CVD-related morbidity and mortality rates.
