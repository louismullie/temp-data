## Question

Erythromycin eye ointment side effects for eyelid growth removal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment when used after eyelid growth removal, likely meaning an eyelid lesion excision or similar oculoplastic procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and what erythromycin ointment is typically used for after eyelid surgery. Then, I should verify the expected side effect profile of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment itself. Next, I will examine procedure-specific considerations such as wound location, concurrent medications, and patient risk factors. After that, I need to consider duration of use and whether the regimen is prophylactic or therapeutic. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to counseling and monitoring, with special attention to differentiating ophthalmic from topical acne formulations and highlighting rare but serious reactions to watch for.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the likely product in question. After eyelid lesion excision, erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment is commonly used to prevent infection, provide ocular surface lubrication, and protect the cornea, often alongside lubricants and sometimes steroids in a time-limited postoperative regimen; multiple oculoplastic reports describe prescribing erythromycin ointment multiple times daily or once nightly for about 1–2 weeks postoperatively, which aligns with typical practice patterns [^115PjcXE] [^1131Cu8H] [^115hXC65]. Wait, let me verify the formulation nuance before I proceed: erythromycin ointments intended for acne are not for ophthalmic use and carry different safety instructions; I should ensure we are discussing the sterile ophthalmic ointment, not the acne gel, because the latter is explicitly "not for ophthalmic use" and can cause significant irritation near the eyes [^11765mDV] [^116BJr9f].

> Next, I should review the expected side effect profile of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. The most frequently reported reactions are minor ocular irritations, redness, and hypersensitivity; these are typically transient and mild with appropriate use, and serious systemic adverse effects are not expected with short-term topical ocular use due to minimal systemic absorption [^113ngzin] [^113KA97c]. Hold on, I should verify whether any systemic macrolide risks (for example, QT prolongation) are relevant here; those risks pertain to oral or intravenous erythromycin and are not a concern with brief postoperative topical ophthalmic application, so I should not conflate them with ocular use [^117GaDzw] [^116RbYUk].

> I will now examine procedure-specific factors that modify risk. Let me consider wound location and concurrent therapies: if the excision is near the lash line or involves the lid margin, transient burning or irritation may be more noticeable; if a steroid ointment is co-prescribed, cumulative irritancy is possible, though this is uncommon with short courses; and in patients with sensitive ocular surfaces or dry eye, erythromycin's petrolatum base may blur vision briefly and feel "sticky", which is usually manageable and improves with blinking or a warm compress afterward. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "contact dermatitis is very common", but I should correct that: contact dermatitis is listed as uncommon with topical erythromycin in dermatologic labeling, and while it can occur, it is not the dominant reaction with ophthalmic ointment; the more typical experience is minor irritation or redness, so I should frame it accurately as uncommon rather than very common [^116KuTNw] [^113ngzin].

> Let me think about duration and intent of therapy. Prophylactic postoperative use for roughly 1–2 weeks carries a lower risk of superinfection or resistance emergence compared with prolonged therapeutic courses; nonetheless, I should counsel on the rare possibility of nonsusceptible organism overgrowth, including fungal proliferation, and advise stopping the ointment and reassessing if unexpected discharge, worsening erythema, or new symptoms develop [^113ngzin] [^113KA97c]. I should double-check that this risk remains theoretical for short postoperative prophylaxis; in practice, it is uncommon but worth recognizing early if it occurs [^113ngzin].

> But wait, what if the patient has a macrolide allergy or prior hypersensitivity? I need to ensure I screen for prior reactions to erythromycin or related macrolides, because hypersensitivity is a contraindication; if there is a history of significant allergic reaction, an alternative ophthalmic antibiotic such as bacitracin can be considered per blepharitis and postoperative care principles, and this substitution should be documented clearly [^113ngzin] [^111tJ7bY]. Hold on, I should verify that bacitracin is an acceptable alternative in this context; yes, bacitracin ointment is commonly used on lid margins for blepharitis and is reasonable postoperatively when erythromycin is not suitable [^111tJ7bY].

> I should also review rare but important reactions to monitor. Although exceedingly uncommon with brief ophthalmic use, generalized urticarial reactions have been reported with topical erythromycin preparations; if a patient develops facial or body rash, pruritus, or angioedema, I should discontinue the ointment and seek urgent care, documenting a presumed drug reaction and avoiding future macrolide exposure pending formal allergy evaluation [^111pH4nQ] [^116X17my]. Let me reconsider whether any of these systemic-type reactions have been linked to ophthalmic ointment specifically; reports exist for topical erythromycin products, and while rare, they justify vigilance and patient counseling on warning signs [^111pH4nQ] [^116X17my].

> Next, I should review practical counseling points to mitigate nuisance effects. I will instruct on aseptic technique to avoid contaminating the tube tip, apply a small ribbon (about 0.5–1 cm) to the lower conjunctival sac or along the lid margin as directed, and advise that transient blurred vision and mild burning or grittiness are expected and typically resolve quickly; if irritation persists beyond a few days or worsens, I should reassess for allergy, superinfection, or alternative diagnoses such as dry eye or corneal exposure [^113ngzin] [^113KA97c]. I need to ensure the patient understands not to rub the eye vigorously after surgery and to report any increasing pain, purulent discharge, or vision changes promptly, as these could signal a complication beyond simple irritation [^115wqULM].

> Finally, I should synthesize a risk-stratified approach. For most patients using erythromycin ophthalmic ointment for 1–2 weeks after eyelid growth removal, the risk of significant side effects is low; expected effects are minor irritation, redness, and transient blurred vision, with rare hypersensitivity or superinfection possible. In patients with known macrolide allergy, I should choose an alternative agent; in those with highly sensitive ocular surfaces, I can consider preservative-free lubricants to offset any mild irritation; and in prolonged or recurrent courses, I should reassess for overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms and consider culture or a change in therapy if clinical response is atypical [^113ngzin] [^111tJ7bY] [^113TRocc]. Hold on, let me verify alignment with guideline-based postoperative care: this approach is consistent with AAO blepharitis and external disease guidance that endorses short courses of topical antibiotics on lid margins and with postoperative oculoplastic practices described in the literature, reinforcing both safety and appropriateness in this setting [^112Q3dq4] [^111tJ7bY] [^115wqULM].

Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is commonly used after eyelid growth removal to prevent infection and aid healing; **most side effects are mild and local**, including transient burning, stinging, irritation, blurred vision, and eyelid dermatitis [^111gCwHL] [^112h1bv6]. Rare hypersensitivity reactions (allergic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis) can occur; **stop use if they develop** [^113ngzin]. Systemic side effects are uncommon with topical use but may include gastrointestinal upset or rare hypersensitivity [^notfound]. Monitor for persistent redness, swelling, or discharge, and seek care if symptoms worsen or persist beyond a few days [^notfound].

---

## Common local side effects

The **most frequently reported side effects** of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment applied to the eyelid or ocular surface include:

- **Burning or stinging sensation**: Commonly reported upon application, typically transient and mild [^notfound].

- **Irritation or discomfort**: Mild irritation or discomfort may occur, especially if the ointment comes into direct contact with the conjunctiva or cornea [^113ngzin].

- **Blurred vision**: Temporary blurred vision may occur due to the ointment's viscosity and lubricating properties [^notfound].

- **Eyelid dermatitis**: Mild dermatitis or skin irritation may develop on the eyelid skin, particularly with prolonged use or in individuals with sensitive skin [^116KuTNw].

---

## Rare hypersensitivity reactions

Although uncommon, **hypersensitivity reactions** may occur, including:

- **Allergic conjunctivitis**: Characterized by redness, itching, and tearing of the eyes [^notfound].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Localized skin rash, redness, and itching on the eyelid or periocular skin [^116KuTNw].

- **Generalized urticaria**: Rarely, systemic allergic reactions characterized by widespread hives or rash may occur [^111pH4nQ].

Patients with a known hypersensitivity to erythromycin or other macrolide antibiotics should avoid use of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment [^notfound].

---

## Systemic side effects

Systemic side effects are uncommon with topical erythromycin ophthalmic ointment due to minimal systemic absorption. However, **rare systemic reactions** have been reported, including:

- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur rarely [^notfound].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with erythromycin-containing products [^111EFsjr].

---

## Precautions and contraindications

- **Hypersensitivity**: Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to erythromycin or any of its components [^113ngzin].

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Although topical erythromycin has minimal systemic absorption, caution is advised in pregnant or lactating women. Animal studies have not demonstrated teratogenic effects, but human data are limited [^113ngzin].

- **Contact lens wearers**: Patients who wear contact lenses should avoid using erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, as it may interfere with lens comfort and clarity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical recommendations and patient counseling

Patients should be instructed to apply a small amount (approximately 1 cm ribbon) of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment to the affected eyelid or conjunctival sac as directed by their healthcare provider [^111gCwHL]. They should also be advised to **avoid contaminating the applicator tip** with material from the eye, fingers, or other sources to prevent infection [^113ngzin]. If any signs of allergic reaction occur — such as redness, swelling, itching, or rash — patients should discontinue use and seek medical attention promptly. Persistent redness, swelling, discharge, or discomfort beyond a few days warrants further evaluation by a healthcare professional [^notfound].

## Summary of side effects

| **Side effect category** | **Common side effects** | **Rare side effects** |
|-|-|-|
| Local | - Burning/stinging <br/> - Irritation <br/> - Blurred vision <br/> - Eyelid dermatitis | - Allergic conjunctivitis <br/> - Contact dermatitis |
| Systemic | - Rare gastrointestinal upset | - Rare hypersensitivity reactions |

---

Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is generally well-tolerated for eyelid growth removal, with **most side effects being mild and local**. Rare hypersensitivity reactions and minimal systemic absorption make it a safe option for postoperative care when used as directed [^111gCwHL].

Warnings

Topical gels and creams are intended for external use only and should be kept away from eyes, nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes because of its irritant effect. Do not apply to eyelids or to the skin at the corners of the eyes and mouth. Avoid the angles of the nose and nasolabial fold (if treatment in these areas; is necessary, apply very sparingly). Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily or discontinue use altogether.

Postoperative Care

Erythromycin eye ointment was applied over the incision immediately after surgery, and the patient was instructed apply ice compress for half an hour before discharge. The patient was advised to apply ice compress as frequently as possible and avoid vigorous exercise for the first 72 hours after surgery. Oral antibiotics were not required, and no suture needed to be removed. Patients could wear makeup 3 days after the surgery and were advised not to rub their upper eyelids for 1 month. Patients were re-examined routinely at 5 days, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery through the outpatient service or WeChat. All patients were encouraged to return for follow-up if they experienced any problems or complications.

### Use of erythromycin in the prevention of neonatal ophthalmia – 2025 [^111TGii9]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia prevention — primary prevention involves universal screening and treatment of pregnant women for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection along with ocular prophylaxis for neonates; currently, erythromycin is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved prophylactic agent, while tetracycline ophthalmic ointment and silver nitrate are no longer available in the United States and gentamicin used during an erythromycin shortage was associated with ocular adverse reactions. The estimated cost of routine neonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin is $1.94 per infant, and it has historically been favored due to relatively low cost and mild adverse effects. In 2019, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin ointment for all newborns within 24 hours after birth, and in 2021 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended universal prophylaxis by instilling erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment into both eyes of all newborns as soon as possible after birth, ideally in the delivery room and within 24 hours. Recently, there has been discussion about the need for mandatory prophylaxis and targeting prophylaxis to high-risk cases, and a 2024 American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement supports ongoing re-evaluation of the medical necessity of legislative mandates in the United States for universal neonatal eye prophylaxis.

### Ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^113vZsLr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Other considerations — research needs and gaps note that the only available US Food and Drug Administration–approved drug for preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum is 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and it is currently unknown whether Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to erythromycin ointment in the United States. Given increased antimicrobial resistance noted in other countries, further research is needed to find safe and effective alternatives to erythromycin, and another area for research is whether risk-based prophylaxis of newborns, based on maternal risk factors, is as effective as universal prophylaxis.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^116i2RA9]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — oral antibiotics for MGD and pediatric dosing — Oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful for patients with MGD whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled by eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, and doxycycline, minocycline, or tetracycline can be given daily and tapered after clinical improvement is noted. To avoid using tetracyclines in women of childbearing age and in children, oral erythromycin or azithromycin may be used, with one suggested dosing regimen for erythromycin in children being 30 to 40 mg/kg divided over 3 doses for 3 weeks, then twice daily for 4 to 6 weeks, and a pediatric dosing regimen for azithromycin of 5 mg/kg daily for 2 months shown to be helpful for clinical improvement in a small case series. However, a Cochrane systematic review reported uncertainty with respect to indications and effectiveness of both topical and systemic treatments for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children due to the lack of high-quality evidence.

PRECAUTIONS

General

For topical use only; not for ophthalmic use. Concomitant topical
acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy
effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating or abrasive
agents. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate
therapy.

The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of
nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. If this occurs, discontinue use and
take appropriate measures.

Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes.

Information for Patients

Patients using Erythromycin-Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel should
receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for
external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, and all mucous
membranes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for
which it was prescribed.
Patients should not use any other topical acne preparation unless otherwise
directed by physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse
reactions.
Erythromycin-Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel may bleach hair or colored
fabric.
Keep product refrigerated and discard after 3 months.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility

Data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to
cancer suggests that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical
significance of this is unknown.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^111tJ7bY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis care management — treat patients initially with a regimen of warm compresses and eyelid cleansing. A topical antibiotic such as bacitracin or erythromycin can be prescribed to be applied one or more times daily or at bedtime on the eyelid margins for a few weeks. For patients with meibomian gland dysfunction whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled with eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful. Topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline, and isotretinoin are effective treatments for patients with systemic rosacea. A brief course of topical corticosteroids may be helpful for eyelid or ocular surface inflammation; the minimal effective dose of corticosteroid should be utilized and long-term topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided if possible. An eyelid tumor should be suspected in patients with atypical eyelid-margin inflammation or disease not responsive to medical therapy, and these patients should be carefully re-evaluated.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^11785W4r]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal abrasion — field management emphasizes topical therapy, pain control, and avoiding patching, with graded recommendations provided. Corneal abrasions in the wilderness should be treated with topical antibiotics (such as erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 h), cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h), NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 6 h), and frequent use of artificial tears; sunglasses may help reduce photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching, and bandage soft contact lenses should be used only if there is no retained corneal foreign body, they are used with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 h. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide acute relief but prolonged use should be avoided because they are potentially toxic to the corneal epithelium; a recent randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline for uncomplicated abrasions concluded there was no significant difference in corneal healing with an overall patient perception of improved pain control. Recommendation grades include: Topical antibiotics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Artificial tears — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Sunglasses — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Avoidance of patching — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for open globe or deep epithelial defects — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Tacrolimus (Protopic) [^111euh5W]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

What should patients avoid while using PROTOPIC
Ointment?

Advise patients:

Do not use ultraviolet light therapy, sun lamps, or tanning beds during
treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment.
Limit sun exposure during treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment even when the
medicine is not on their skin. If patients need to be outdoors after applying
PROTOPIC Ointment, wear loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area
from the sun. Doctors should advise what other types of protection from the sun
patients should use.
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages, dressings or wraps.
Patients can wear normal clothing.
Avoid getting PROTOPIC Ointment in the eyes or mouth. Do not swallow
PROTOPIC Ointment. Patients should call their doctor if they swallow PROTOPIC
Ointment.

Drug Interactions

Formal topical drug interaction studies with PROTOPIC Ointment
have not been conducted. Based on its extent of absorption, interactions of
PROTOPIC Ointment with systemically administered drugs are unlikely to occur but
cannot be ruled out (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY). The concomitant administration of known CYP3A4
inhibitors in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be
done with caution. Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin, itraconazole,
ketoconazole, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers and cimetidine.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^115mR5Zh]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium". Recommendation ratings: Topical or systemic antibiotics: 1A; Hand washing: 1C.

PRECAUTIONS

General -

For topical use only; not for ophthalmic use. Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents.

The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of antibiotic-resistant organisms. If this occurs, discontinue use and take appropriate measures.

Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes.

Information for Patients -

Patients using Ery 2% Pads should receive the following information and instructions:

1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, and all mucous membranes.

2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.

3. Patients should not use any other topical acne medication unless otherwise directed by their physician.

4. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility -

No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of topical erythromycin. However, long-term (2-year) oral studies in rats with erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B -

There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. Erythromycin has been reported to cross the placental barrier in humans, but fetal plasma levels are generally low.

Nursing Women -

It is not known whether erythromycin is excreted in human milk after topical application. However, erythromycin is excreted in human milk following oral and parenteral erythromycin administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use -

Safety and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1118xr4W]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical summary — ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum states to "Provide prophylactic ocular topical medication to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum" with Grade A. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this prophylaxis, and ocular prophylaxis of newborns is mandated in most states and is considered standard neonatal care. The USPSTF also recommends screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years and younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, as well as pregnant women.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^112Hbiiy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The recommended treatments for BKC is long term eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, meibomian gland, eyelid scrubs) in combination with antibiotic and steroids as needed. Despite this consensus, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials in pediatric BKC.3 Most of the pediatric studies showed improvement in the majority of patients with various treatments, but a high recurrence rate ranging from 40 to 60%. Eyelid hygiene was recommended for all patients in our study, but compliance is difficult to ascertain. However, the majority of patients also received erythromycin ointment and/or topical steroids, with a smaller percentage placed on oral antibiotics. Importantly, there was no difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children in the percentage recommended/prescribed erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, or oral antibiotics, yet the Hispanic children had worse visual outcomes. This may be due to worse initial BCVA in the Hispanic children or better compliance to treatments in the non-Hispanic children.

Though this is one of the largest US-based studies focused on BKC epidemiology with clinical data, it is limited by the relatively small cohort (n = 95) and no control group. In addition, due to its retrospective nature, there are various lengths of follow-up and differences in charting between multiple ophthalmologists within the practice. The exam findings reported in this study are limited to a binary nature, when elements such as corneal scarring occur on a spectrum regarding the effect on vision and eye health. Other studies have graded the severity of the BKC (mild, moderate, and severe); however these grading systems were arbitrary and not dictated by the consensus statement. In addition, as this was a chart review, grading the severity was challenging and thus not included. Several studied factors, including diagnoses of chalazion, PEE/SPK, presence of stromal scarring, and use of traditionally more aggressive treatments were deemed not significant, though greater disparities could be seen with a higher-powered investigation given the significant impact seen on BCVA seen in the Hispanic population compared to the non-Hispanic population. Further, our study did not include the socioeconomoic status, insurance type, or other markers for social determinants of health which could certainly affect access to care and compliance with treatments and ultimately outcomes.

Measures such as cold compress (10–20 min/time, 3 times/d) shall be taken within 48 hours after the operation to reduce the swelling of the upper eyelid after the operation and prevent prolapse of conjunctiva; dressing shall be changed on the first and third days after the operation to keep the wound dry and clean, and stitches shall be removed on the seventh day after the operation. To prevent complications such as exposure keratitis, sodium hyaluronate eye drops, and erythromycin ointment were given 5 to 6 times/d and 4 to 5 times/d, respectively.

Both groups were followed up for 12 months (up to February 2023) after surgery (outpatient follow-up, telephone follow-up, etc), including the treatment effect, changes in the patient's condition and recovery after discharge, and the follow-up data required by the Institute.

Indicators of Observation

Clinical Efficacy and Complications

The clinical effects of the 2 groups were analyzed 6 months after operation. The standard was drawn up according to the Consensus of Experts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Ptosisas follows: (1) good correction: the eyelids open and close normally, the arc of the eyelid is natural and beautiful, the upper eyelid covers the corneal margin ≤ 2 mm above the upper eyelid cover, (2) insufficient correction: the upper eyelid covering the upper edge of pupil between 2 mm and the middle point of pupil, (3) ineffective correction: the upper eyelid edge is below the middle point of pupil when the upper eyelid is horizontal, and (4) excessive correction: the upper eyelid edge is above the upper edge of cornea.

Complications

The incidence of postoperative complications in the two groups was counted, including early complications within 1 month after the operation, including: trichiasis, eyelid hematoma, edema, prolapse of the conjunctiva, corneal epithelium injury; late complications from 1 month to 12 months after operation, including: bad eyelid arc, eyelid margin notch, eyelid angle deformity, eyelid insufficiency and vertical retest.

Measurement Data

The upper lid margin to corneal reflex distance 1 (MRD1) and the palpebral fissure height (PFH) were recorded before the operation, 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after the operation, respectively. The eyelid retrogression at 1 week, 3 months and 12 months after the operation was also recorded.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^115XgXTe]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — topical therapies and combination regimens — Topical perfluorohexyloctane was FDA approved in 2023 and is a prescription treatment that prevents tear evaporation and was shown to improve symptoms and corneal staining in patients with dry eye disease after 8 weeks of treatment. In meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), a phase 2 clinical trial reported significant improvements with selenium sulfide in glands secreting meibum and in a mean Ocular Surface Disease Index score compared with vehicle. For anterior blepharitis, a topical antibiotic ointment such as bacitracin or erythromycin can be prescribed and applied on the eyelid margins one or more times daily or at bedtime for a few weeks, and topical antibiotic treatment can be repeated on an intermittent basis using different medications to prevent resistant organisms. The clinical efficacy of topical tobramycin/dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension and azithromycin in a sustained release system has been evaluated in uncontrolled (off label) manufacturer-sponsored studies, and these topical treatments appear to reduce some of the signs and symptoms of blepharitis; additionally, topical administration of loteprednol etabonate 0.5%/tobramycin 0.3% has been shown to be safe when compared with dexamethasone due to less risk of elevated intraocular pressure rise.

### Use of erythromycin in the prevention of neonatal ophthalmia – 2025 [^116gTL22]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) epidemiology and clinical features — ON is defined as conjunctivitis presenting in the first 4 weeks of life, with frequently identified etiologies including Staphylococcus spp. and Serratia marcescens, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae historically the most visually significant due to aggressive progression with a high risk of corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and rapid vision loss. Colonization typically occurs during delivery with a brief incubation period that is typically less than 3 days but can extend up to 3 weeks, and infection is generally bilateral with marked eyelid edema and chemosis; watery discharge appears early and rapidly progresses to mucopurulence, with severe cases potentially developing corneal ulceration, globe perforation, and panophthalmitis. Chlamydia trachomatis with milder symptoms accounts for up to 40% of ON cases, and co-infection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis is common. In the United States, gonococcal ON prevalence has remained low with estimates ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 cases per 100,000 live births during 2010–2015, though these estimates were based on data from the first year of life rather than the first month; prevalence depends on infection prevalence among pregnant women and screening/treatment during pregnancy, and a recent report noted increased disease burden among women of reproductive age (15–39 years) over the past decade, potentially elevating risk.

Nail Changes.

When monitoring for paronychia or fissures, it is important to begin careful inspections of the hands and feet early during treatment and to continue these inspections at every clinic visit. If nail abnormalities are identified, the treatments described included antibacterial emollient applied regularly, corticosteroid ointments, or a white vinegar in water solution (1 part vinegar, 1 part water). Other suggested treatments for paronychia include the use of gentamycin ointment for 4 to 5 weeks, bathing the hands and/or feet in a diluted chloramine bath, and wearing loose-fitting shoes to avoid pressure to the nail beds. Preemptive daily treatment with corticosteroids was shown to reduce the incidence of paronychia in both the J-STEPP and STEPP studies.

Hair Abnormalities.

For the treatment of trichomegaly, the reported data suggest trimming eyelashes that are long or curled (usually by an ophthalmologist) and removing eyelashes that have misdirected growth (again, usually by an ophthalmologist). For other hair and scalp problems, emollients, such as those used for skin rash, and erythromycin ophthalmic ointments can be used. Patients who experience an acneiform eruption on the scalp can be treated with an oil bath and topical steroid therapy. If the eruption is infected, an oil bath, followed by treatment with oral antibiotics, has been recommended; topical antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin, are not effective in the treatment of scalp infections. Hair stickiness can also be treated with an oil bath or using mild shampoos.

Pediculosis palpebrarum (Phthirus pubis) — treatment includes mechanical removal, topical occlusive ointment, decontamination, and partner management. Forceps can be used to mechanically remove the adult lice and nits (eggs) from the eyelids and eyelashes, adherent nits may require epilation, and cutting the lashes at their base with Westcott or other microsurgical scissors is an alternative for heavy infestation. A bland ophthalmic ointment (e.g., petrolatum, erythromycin, bacitracin) applied two to three times a day for 10 days will smother the adult lice and nits, and compliance is important. Patients and close contacts should be advised to use anti-lice lotion and shampoo for nonocular areas and to wash and dry clothing and bedding thoroughly (using the highest temperature of the dryer for 30 minutes). Patients and sexual contacts should be informed about the possibility of concomitant disease and should be referred appropriately, and sexual abuse should be considered in children with P. pubis infestation.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies and determined the included RCTs, which were further assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardized manner and conducted random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan Web.

Main Results

We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.

Frontal muscle flap suspension:

(1) The double eyelid line incision is used as the surgical incision, the height is slightly lower than the general double eyelid line, usually 5 to 6 mm, and marked with methylene blue.
(2) Use 2% lidocaine plus 1:100,000 epinephrine for local infiltration anesthesia.
(3) Cut the skin, separate and cut down the orbicularis muscle with a width of about 2 mm before the tarsal plate, expose the tarsal plate, and perform a sneak separation between the orbital septum and the orbicularis muscle, and separate to the junction of the orbicularis and frontalis, use scissors to cut and flip to the top of the frontal muscle to continue separating the frontal muscle and skin, and separate to 1 cm above the eyebrow. Lift the frontal muscle and separate the tissue below it with scissors, pull the frontal muscle like a flap, and remove the stripped frontal muscle, cut the inner and outer sides from bottom to top to form frontal muscle flaps.
(4) Fix the frontalis muscle flap on the upper 1/3 of the tarsal plate with 6–0 absorbable thread, and do 3 to 5 stitches of mattress suture. In this process, the patient is asked to sit up and adjust the upper eyelid height to a satisfactory position repeatedly.
(5) Suture the skin incision with double eyelid surgery.

After operation, sodium hyaluronate eye drops are given 4 times a day and erythromycin eye ointment is given once a day before going to bed.

Corneal abrasion — treatment and indications for evacuation: Prompt removal of evident corneal foreign body is recommended, and if open globe is suspected or deep corneal epithelial defects are apparent, then evacuation is emergent. Treatment includes topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 hours), cycloplegics (atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours), and frequent artificial tears. Sunglasses may help photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching. Bandage soft contact lenses should be used only when no retained corneal foreign body is present, they are paired with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 hours. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide diagnostic and acute pain relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal epithelial toxicity. Recommendation categories are Topical antibiotics: 1A; Cycloplegics: 1A; NSAIDs: 1A; Artificial tears: 1C; Sunglasses: 1C.

Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating or abrasive agents. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. If this occurs, discontinue use and take appropriate measures.

Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes.

Information for Patients: Patients using Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, and all mucous membranes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
Patients should not use any other topical acne preparation unless otherwise directed by physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.
Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP may bleach hair or colored fabric.
Keep product refrigerated and discard after 3 months.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggests that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of topical erythromycin. However, long-term (2-year) oral studies in rats with erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects:

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP or benzoyl peroxide.

There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters.

There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women with Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP. It also is not known whether Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 1% azithromycin-0.1% dexamethasone combination compared to 1% azithromycin alone, 0.1% dexamethasone alone, and vehicle in the treatment of subjects with blepharitis [^112ViTKR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The same 1% azithromycin–0.1% dexamethasone combination in DuraSite has been previously studied as a treatment for blepharoconjunctivitis, where it proved to be superior to both azithromycin alone and dexamethasone alone in achieving a clinical cure and reducing bacterial colony-count scores. In this study, the combined 1% azithromycin–0.1% dexamethasone was superior to 1% azithromycin and vehicle alone, but not to 0.1% dexamethasone alone. Blepharitis and blepharoconjunctivitis represent a diverse spectrum of disease, and the difference in study outcomes may be a reflection of the multimodality of the disease state, rather than the investigated treatments. Luchs summarized several studies evaluating 1% azithromycin for blepharitis where efficacy was reported, but most of the studies were small in nature and open-label in design. In our study, both drops containing 0.1% dexamethasone were found to be superior to 1% azithromycin or vehicle alone in resolving the clinical signs of eyelid redness and eyelid debris. In this study, no evaluation of bacterial eradication was performed, and many clinicians believe the addition of an antibiotic is important to manage microbial overgrowth.

There are several strengths to this study. The first is the large number of patients enrolled. In addition, this is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a treatment for blepharitis for 6 months postdosing. In most other studies, patients were only followed until day 15 or at most 1 month. The longer follow-up was selected to detect a possible recurrence rate and evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 1% azithromycin and 0.1% dexamethasone alone and in combination. Our study, while large and enrolling more than 900 subjects, also retained the majority of subjects through the 6-month follow-up. This suggests that longer treatment regimens may be necessary in some patients, in order to achieve and maintain complete clinical resolution.

There are some limitations to this study, however. There were a small number of patients who reached full resolution by study exit (a primary end point). This could be reflective of overall poor end-point choice, but discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration dictated these chosen end points. Unfortunately, the small numbers also mean we are unable to generalize our findings to a wider potential patient base. Finally, our QoL questionnaire had not been validated in time to generate more than subjective impressions.

Patient 2 was a 25-year-old man with bilateral eye infection that started on the left eye a week before the patient sought care. The eye had redness, swelling, blurred vision with loss of acuity, and irritation. The right eye had the same symptoms on the day of visit. Examination found bilateral keratoconjunctivitis and a 3-mm cyst with drainage on the lower palpebrum. The patient was treated with ofloxacin ophthalmic drops for 4 months but did not improve. A specimen was then collected from his right eye for culture. In 2014, he was given a diagnosis of chronic conjunctivitis.

Patient 3 was a 33-year-old man with severe pain, erythema, and swelling on his left eyelid. His symptoms started 1 week before he sought care and included swelling, increased cyst size, and disturbed vision. The pustular exudate was aspirated and sent to the laboratory. The patient was prescribed erythromycin ointment and oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient's eye had improved at 3 weeks.

Data including demographic information, medical and ocular history, ophthalmic diagnoses, examination findings, and BKC treatments were collected at initial presentation (baseline), 6-month, 1-year, and successive annual increments until disease clearance or final follow-up. Unilateral refractive amblyopia was defined as > 2 line interocular difference in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) due to anisometropia (hyperopic, myopic, or astigmatic). Bilateral refractive amblyopia secondary to high hyperopia (> + 3.00), high myopia (< -6.00), or high astigmatism (> + 2.00) was defined as BCVA less than 20/25 in both eyes. In addition, history of eye and eyelid surgeries (e.g. chalazion incision and drainage) was recorded. BCVA for each eye was measured with age-appropriate optotypes (e.g. LEA figures, HOTV, or Snellen) and then converted into LogMAR format. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by iCare tonometry (Icare USA, Inc, Raleigh, NC) or Tonopen (Reichert, Depew, NY). Cycloplegic refraction was performed by retinoscopy and when age-appropriate fine-tuned in the phoropter. Slit lamp findings included MGD, punctate epithelial erosions/superficial punctate keratopathy (PEE/SPK) as identified by fluorescein staining, eyelid scurf, chalazion/hordeolum, corneal infiltrates, corneal neovascularization, and corneal stromal scarring. Treatments such as eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, eyelid scrubs), erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, and oral antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, doxycycline) were recorded.

Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic blepharitis is a common multifactorial ocular disease commonly associated with eyelid inflammation and secondary ocular irritation. The disease is chronic, difficult to manage, supposedly recurs often, and its chronicity can lead to scarring of the eyelid and loss of proper eyelid and tear-film function. There are no therapeutic guidelines, and the standard treatment involves local lid hygiene and eyelid scrubs with warm-compress lid therapy. Topical and systemic antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, and tear-replacement therapy are common adjunctive therapies. Antibiotics are used to decrease the bacterial load, while corticosteroids are used to relieve inflammation. Clinical trials have shown antibiotics and corticosteroids can produce "significant" improvement in signs and symptoms.

Topical azithromycin is a second-generation macrolide under investigation for the treatment of blepharitis. This broad-spectrum antibiotic has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as lipid-inducing effects, and has been observed in open-label studies to provide significant clinical benefits.–

Currently available ocular antibiotic–steroid fixed-dose combination products are typically dosed every 4–6 hours. ISV-502 (hereafter referred to as "combination") is an ophthalmic formulation of the antibiotic azithromycin and the corticosteroid dexamethasone formulated in DuraSite (InSite Vision, Alameda, CA, USA). This drug-delivery system has been designed as a long-acting topical eyedrop that can be dosed twice daily for 14 days, which should improve treatment compliance. Safety and efficacy of systemic azithromycin have been documented during the 25+ years it has been marketed in the US. An ophthalmic solution (AzaSite; InSite Vision) was approved for marketing in 2007 for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Similarly, dexamethasone has been used since the mid-1960s to treat numerous inflammatory conditions, including allergy, skin conditions, and ulcerative colitis. In ophthalmic indications, dexamethasone is approved to treat conjunctivitis, keratitis, and diabetic macular edema.

This study (C-10–502–004; NCT01408082) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination compared with 0.1% dexamethasone alone, 1% azithromycin in DuraSite, and vehicle applied twice daily for 14 days to subjects with blepharitis. Clinical efficacy was defined as complete resolution of signs and symptoms at day 15.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% for treatment of refractory childhood phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis [^113kGA8r]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report 2 cases of refractory phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis treated with topical tacrolimus 0.03% ointment (Protopic).

Methods

Two white children, aged 5 years and 6 years, respectively, presented with refractory phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis in 1 eye (left). Both were using corticosteroids and oral erythromycin at presentation with no relief. Examination revealed the presence of catarrhal corneal infiltrates and neovascularization associated with corneal thinning. Topical tacrolimus was added to topical steroids and oral erythromycin twice daily.

Results

Topical tacrolimus 0.03% ointment was applied into the lower fornix twice a day. In both the patients, improvement in symptoms and signs started within a week of therapy. After 3 weeks of treatment, both patients showed complete resolution of corneal infiltrates and neovascularization. Tacrolimus was successfully tapered in both the patients. There were no side effects.

Conclusions

Topical tacrolimus 0.03% ointment may be considered in treating severe refractory phlyctenular conjunctivitis.

### Outcome of tarsoconjunctival flap dehiscence after eyelid reconstruction [^114EhqGC]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the outcome of eyelid reconstruction with a tarsoconjunctival flap complicated by premature flap dehiscence.

Design

Interventional case series.

Methods

In eight of approximately 100 patients who underwent unilateral lower eyelid reconstruction with a tarsoconjunctival (Hughes) flap during a 15-year interval, the procedure was complicated by premature flap dehiscence resulting from accidental trauma 1 to 11 days after the reconstructive procedure. Immediate surgical repair of the dehiscence was attempted in one case, but the tissues reopened within 1 day. Otherwise, the eyelids were permitted to heal spontaneously with the application of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment as the sole therapy.

Results

Although the reconstructed eyelids healed satisfactorily in each case, one patient, who had dry eyes from Sjögren syndrome, required secondary surgery to treat mild lagophthalmos and lower eyelid retraction.

Conclusions

The ultimate functional and esthetic outcomes after premature, traumatic dehiscence of a Hughes flap were generally satisfactory, suggesting that elective division of the conjunctival pedicle in uncomplicated cases may be performed relatively soon after the primary reconstructive procedure.

### Management and outcomes of proteasome inhibitor associated chalazia and blepharitis: a case series [^115jn8pZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Of 34 eyelid complication episodes, outcomes are known in 29 (Fig. 1). The most common ocular treatments for patients included warm compresses (18 episodes), systemic antibiotics (9 episodes), topical antibiotic eye drops and/or ointment (12 episodes), and topical steroid drops and/or ointment (4 episodes). Due to the retrospective nature of this case series, treatment regimens and patient education were not standardized. Furthermore, patient compliance rates may have varied. Refer to Fig. 2 for outcomes of specific ocular therapies. During episodes in which bortezomib was discontinued, 7/17 times it was solely withheld (3 episodes resolved), while 8/17 times it was withheld and switched to ixazomib or carfilzomib (6 episodes resolved). There were 19 chalazia episodes with known post-treatment outcomes, and 4 episodes of unknown outcome that were excluded. Of nine chalazia episodes treated with ocular-directed therapy alone, 4 (44%) completely resolved. Of ten chalazia episodes treated with ocular therapy and bortezomib omission, 8 (80%) completely resolved. There were 10 blepharitis episodes with known post-treatment outcomes, and 1 episode of unknown outcome that was excluded. Three (100%) episodes treated with ocular therapy alone resolved completely, while 3 (60%) of the 5 episodes with ocular treatment and bortezomib omission completely resolved.

### Safety and efficacy of a growth factor and cytokine-containing topical product in wound healing and incision scar management after upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a prospective split-face study [^116eXv36]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

A higher percentage (although not statistically significant in most parameters) of eyelids treated with the study product had a better scar appearance and grading of the erythema and pigmentation than the untreated eyelid, as graded by the investigator, at the 6-week and 10-week time points (Tables 2–4). However, these positive effects seem to be temporary, with the vast majority of cases showing improvement or resolution of erythema and pigmentation in both eyes and a more similar appearance by the end of the study. These outcomes show that, although both the eyelids achieved similar appearances 14 weeks following surgery, the treated side seemed to achieve final appearance faster. Some authors believe that high molecular weight compounds including cytokines and growth factors may not simply penetrate a healthy skin, although very low concentrations of these molecules are usually sufficient to reach the receptor sites. Disrupted skin surface of the surgical wound may facilitate the penetration of the active ingredients and may be responsible for the more effects of the product in the first weeks of application. Taken together, these outcomes suggest that regular topical application of Lumière, although not very strongly, might contribute to a faster resolution of the temporary effects after upper eyelid blepharoplasty such as erythema, pigmentation, and scar appearance.

Lumière eye cream showed to be a safe product in our study. Adverse side effects including itching, redness, and ocular irritation were noted in three subjects and all complaints improved after discontinuation of the product. No serious or permanent side effects were noted in our series. Similarly, in the series by Lupo et al, all patients tolerated the eye cream well and no significant side effects were reported.

Study limitations include a subject bias since they were not blinded to the treatment side, the subtlety of scar, and overall eyelid appearances that can be difficult to assess objectively and a relatively low sample size. It is the subtlety of the eyelids and scar appearance that influence patient satisfaction, thus determining the success of aesthetic procedures. The significance of the differences between the treated and control eyelids might be strengthened by a higher number of patients.

### Sebaceous carcinoma presenting as chronic chalazion [^111k2a6R]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma presenting as treatment-resistant chalazion. Diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy after failed treatment with warm compresses, eyelid hygiene and erythromycin ointment. Conjunctival map biopsies excluded local spread. MRI of the orbits and whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated no metastatic disease. Definitive treatment was accomplished by wide local excision with no recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Sebaceous carcinoma often masquerades as benign diagnoses, such as blepharitis and chalazion, yet it is an aggressive cancer with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, a high level of suspicion is required to avoid vision loss and death by metastatic disease. There are currently no targeted therapies for advanced disease, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis. Furthermore, recognition of the association of sebaceous carcinoma with Muir-Torre Syndrome is important to guide future cancer screening and management.

### Interventions for rosacea [^113Q74Cw]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are associated with highest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating rosacea?

Bottom Line

There is high-quality evidence that topical brimonidine, azelaic acid, and ivermectin, as well as oral doxycycline and isotretinoin, are associated with improvements in rosacea. Lower-quality evidence is available for topical metronidazole, oral tetracycline, laser and light-based therapy, and topical cyclosporine for ocular rosacea. Most treatments are not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.

### Influence of bacterial burden on meibomian gland dysfunction and ocular surface disease [^111Avjbg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our results pose a challenge for development of a "universal" treatment algorithm for dry eye/MGD in terms of targeting the microbial milieu. One may argue MDG/OSD should be treated via eradication of the bacterial biofilm – this may be accomplished by mechanical debridement (eg, Blephex ®, meibomian gland expression, Lipiflow ® [TearScience ®, Morrisville, NC, USA]) and/or antibiotic use (topical or oral). In our study, 20% of all cultures were found to be macrolide (erythromycin, specifically) resistant; whereas only 3.6% were tetracycline-resistant (all coagulase negative staph). We believe this information is meaningful in that we should rethink the treatment of blepharitis with antibiotics (specifically macrolides), and perhaps make use of doxycycline (if necessary), not necessarily for its antimicrobial effect, but anti-inflammatory effect on the eyelid margin and within meibomian glands.,

The biofilm created by bacteria, especially staphylococcal species (S. aureus and S. epidermidis in particular – the most prominent organisms seen in our study) is quite strong, and may be resistant to white blood cells, antibiotics, and povidone iodine scrubs. Additionally, it has been shown that the bacteria in the biofilm can release virulence factors (cytolytic toxins, proteases, and lipases capable of destroying host tissue) causing escalating levels of inflammation not only on the lid margin, but also on the ocular surface, meibomian glands, and accessory lacrimal glands. The biofilm likely thickens and diversifies with age, explaining why MGD and dry eye worsen with increasing age. If we cannot effectively eradicate this biofilm that resides on the eyelid margin, we cannot effectively reach the areas of the eye/eyelids that require treatment.

### The penetration of 0.005% fluticasone propionate ointment in eyelid skin [^116Zp3AY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The use of corticosteroids to treat periorbital dermatoses carries significant risk of serious side effects such as glaucoma, cataracts, and blindness. Studies to assess levels of corticosteroid penetration in the eyelid are lacking.

Objective

We assessed corticosteroid penetration in eyelid skin in vitro to obtain information leading to the establishment of safer dosing regimens.

Methods

Fluticasone propionate ointment, 0.005%, was applied (approximately 2–5 mg/cm(2)) to samples of human eyelid skin, and penetration was assessed by using modified Franz diffusion cells. Drug concentration was determined at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after application by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

Results

Only very small amounts of fluticasone propionate penetrated the skin (range, 0.618% ± 0.339% to 1.467% ± 0.695%).

Conclusion

Further studies are warranted to examine the safety and efficacy of 0.005% fluticasone propionate ointment for the treatment of eyelid dermatoses.

### Management and outcomes of proteasome inhibitor associated chalazia and blepharitis: a case series [^113PZs7V]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients treated with ocular therapies alone, the average time to eyelid complication resolution was 55 days (1.8 months). In patients treated with ocular therapies alone whose eyelid complications did not resolve, the average amount of time that conservative therapy was trialed was 53 days (1.8 months), before proceeding to bortezomib omission. In patients in which bortezomib was subsequently omitted, the average time from omission to resolution of eyelid complications was 93 days (3.1 months). Given the variability in ocular therapies utilized, these results should be taken with caution until more standardized studies have been completed.

Complete resolution of eyelid complication episodes did not depend on specific treatment approach, when considering ocular therapy alone or in combination with bortezomib omission, or observation with no intervention (p = 0.72). Episodes of chalazia were more likely to completely resolve than episodes of blepharitis (p = 0.03). There was no difference in complete resolution of eyelid complication episodes based on patient gender (p = 0.21), age (p = 0.58), multiple myeloma isotype (p = 0.47), presence of amyloid (p = 0.39), multiple myeloma international staging system score (p = 0.52), or chemotherapy cycle at which the eyelid syndrome was diagnosed (p = 0.09). There was also no difference in complete resolution of episodes based on whether or not bortezomib was solely omitted versus switched to an alternate proteasome inhibitor (p = 0.59).

Only one patient underwent bortezomib rechallenge. This patient had originally experienced an episode of 3 concurrent chalazia 3 months into bortezomib therapy, which resolved upon bortezomib discontinuation in combination with ocular therapy (hot compress, doxycycline, and erythromycin ointment). Chemotherapy was switched to carfilzomib for 5 months. Bortezomib rechallenge occurred during three separate time periods over the course of a year. Chalazia or blepharitis never redeveloped. No other patients underwent rechallenge, as they were either switched to carfilzomib or ixazomib, had bortezomib discontinued permanently, or had resolution of eyelid complications with ocular therapy alone.

### Refining the diagnostic technique to determine prevalence ofMites in eyelash hair follicles within standard ophthalmic practice: a single-center outpatient clinical study [^112PygeY]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several local or systemic treatment options are available for Demodex blepharitis, which have been shown to be effective at reducing or eradicating Demodex mites and improving the symptoms of blepharitis. Treatment selection is usually based on the severity of the condition, with local treatments favored in the majority of cases due to fewer systemic side effects. While Demodex infestation is resistant to a wide range of common antiseptic solutions including 75% alcohol and 10% povidone–iodine and antimicrobials such as erythromycin and metronidazole, mites can dose-dependently be killed by tea tree oil, which forms the basis of several treatments for Demodex. In the literature, it is found that ivermectin (topical and systemic) and ivermectin-metronidazole (topical) are also good anti-Demodex interventions. In addition to traditional pharmacotherapy, light therapies, especially IPL and skin cleansing, could also be considered as effective methods to control Demodex mite infestation. Examination for Demodex infestation should therefore be considered in patients with symptomatic blepharitis and remedial treatment offered to patients in whom Demodex mites are found to be present.

However, Demodex infestation often goes undiagnosed and untreated, due to a significant overlap in signs and symptoms with other ocular surface conditions including anterior or posterior blepharitis, evaporative or non-evaporative dry eye, and other sources of ocular surface inflammation. A conventional method of diagnosing Demodex infestation involves the epilation and microscopic evaluation of four nonadjacent lashes per eyelid, where mites can be visually identified by their characteristic morphology and motility. However, such procedures can be time-consuming to perform and uncomfortable for patients. In addition, random eyelash epilation has been shown to underestimate the density of Demodex infestation, since mite counts may vary based on the presence of cylindrical dandruff at the base of the epilated lash. Consequently, ophthalmologists and optometrists do not commonly diagnose and treat Demodex in routine practice.

To assess the evidence supporting the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective), Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the conjunctiva, antibiotic resistance, and adverse effects (secondary objectives).

Search Methods

We searched relevant electronic databases and trials registers. The date of the last search was 4 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that satisfied either of two criteria: (a) trials in which topical or oral administration of an antibiotic was compared to placebo or no treatment in people or communities with trachoma, (b) trials in which a topical antibiotic was compared with an oral antibiotic in people or communities with trachoma. We also included studies addressing different dosing strategies in the population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies where individuals with trachoma were randomised and 12 cluster-randomised studies. Any antibiotic versus control (individuals)Nine studies (1961 participants) randomised individuals with trachoma to antibiotic or control (no treatment or placebo). All of these studies enrolled children and young people with active trachoma. The antibiotics used in these studies included topical (oxy)tetracycline (5 studies), doxycycline (2 studies), and sulfonamides (4 studies). Four studies had more than two study arms. In general these studies were poorly reported, and it was difficult to judge risk of bias. These studies provided low-certainty evidence that people with active trachoma treated with antibiotics experienced a reduction in active trachoma at three months (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.89; 1961 people; 9 RCTs; I² = 73%) and 12 months (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; 1035 people; 4 RCTs; I² = 90%). Low-certainty evidence was available for ocular infection at three months (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; 297 people; 4 RCTs; I² = 0%) and 12 months (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78; 129 people; 1 RCT). None of these studies assessed antimicrobial resistance. In those studies that reported harms, no serious adverse effects were reported (low-certainty evidence). Oral versus topical antibiotics (individuals)Eight studies (1583 participants) compared oral and topical antibiotics. Only one study included people older than 21 years of age. Oral antibiotics included azithromycin (5 studies), sulfonamides (2 studies), and doxycycline (1 study). Topical antibiotics included (oxy)tetracycline (6 studies), azithromycin (1 study), and sulfonamide (1 study). These studies were poorly reported, and it was difficult to judge risk of bias. There was low-certainty evidence of little or no difference in effect between oral and topical antibiotics on active trachoma at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 953 people; 6 RCTs; I² = 63%) and 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.15; 886 people; 5 RCTs; I² = 56%). There was very low-certainty evidence for ocular infection at three or 12 months. Antimicrobial resistance was not assessed. In those studies that reported adverse effects, no serious adverse effects were reported; one study reported abdominal pain with azithromycin; one study reported a couple of cases of nausea with azithromycin; and one study reported three cases of reaction to sulfonamides (low-certainty evidence). Oral azithromycin versus control (communities)Four cluster-randomised studies compared antibiotic with no or delayed treatment. Data were available on active trachoma at 12 months from two studies but could not be pooled because of reporting differences. One study at low risk of bias found a reduced prevalence of active trachoma 12 months after a single dose of azithromycin in communities with a high prevalence of infection (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.65; 1247 people). The other, lower quality, study in low-prevalence communities reported similar median prevalences of infection at 12 months: 9.3% in communities treated with azithromycin and 8.2% in untreated communities. We judged this moderate-certainty evidence for a reduction in active trachoma with treatment, downgrading one level for inconsistency between the two studies. Two studies reported ocular infection at 12 months and data could be pooled. There was a reduction in ocular infection (RR 0.36, 0.31 to 0.43; 2139 people) 12 months after mass treatment with a single dose compared with no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). There was high-certainty evidence of an increased risk of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli to azithromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin in communities treated with azithromycin, with approximately 5-fold risk ratios at 12 months. The evidence did not support increased resistance to penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. None of the studies measured resistance to C trachomatis. No serious adverse events were reported. The main adverse effect noted for azithromycin (˜10%) was abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Oral azithromycin versus topical tetracycline (communities)Three cluster-randomised studies compared oral azithromycin with topical tetracycline. The evidence was inconsistent for active trachoma and ocular infection at three and 12 months (low-certainty evidence) and was not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity. Antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects were not reported. Different dosing strategiesSix studies compared different strategies for dosing. There were: mass treatment at different dosing intervals; applying cessation or stopping rules to mass treatment; strategies to increase mass treatment coverage. There was no strong evidence to support any variation in the recommended annual mass treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of active trachoma and ocular infection in people infected with C trachomatis, compared to no treatment/placebo, but the size of the treatment effect in individuals is uncertain. Mass antibiotic treatment with single dose oral azithromycin reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection in communities. There is no strong evidence to support any variation in the recommended periodicity of annual mass treatment. There is evidence of an increased risk of antibiotic resistance at 12 months in communities treated with antibiotics.

### Oral doxycycline for the prevention of postoperative trachomatous trichiasis in Ethiopia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114XtSwJ]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Before recruitment, we selected ten experienced trichiasis nurse-surgeons, who did posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR) surgery regularly within the Amhara Region trachoma control programme. The nurse-surgeons had refresher training, which was standardised by an experienced ophthalmologist using the WHO manual assessment procedure. The best six surgeons were chosen to do the surgery in the trial. Participants were treated surgically using PLTR, following the procedures described in the WHO Trichiasis Surgery for Trachoma manual. Postoperatively, operated eyes were padded for 1 day and tetracycline eye ointment 1% was self-administered twice a day for 2 weeks.

Immediately after trichiasis surgery, patients were randomly assigned to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg or placebo 100 mg for 28 days. Participants were examined at 10 days, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. On day 10, participants were examined for postoperative trichiasis and surgical complications before suture removal. At 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month follow-up assessments, participants were re-examined (by SA at 1 month and 6 months and EH at 12 months) and photographed following the same procedures used at baseline. The examiners (EH and SA) were standardised and had very strong agreement for the primary outcome in grading validation studies (κ = 0.92). On the basis of severity, postoperative trichiasis was categorised as minor trichiasis (less than six eyelashes touching the eye, or evidence of epilation in less than a third of the eyelid margin) and major trichiasis (six or more eyelashes touching the eye, or evidence of epilation in a third or more of the eyelid margin). Individuals who had postoperative trichiasis at any follow-up assessment were offered epilation or repeat surgery by the most experienced surgeon in the area on the basis of severity using previously defined criteria. Grading of entropion correction, granuloma, and eyelid contour abnormalities was done according to previously described criteria. Participants with other ophthalmic pathologies were referred to the nearest eye unit.

At day 10 and 1 month follow-up assessments, participants were interviewed about drug adherence and adverse events. Drug adherence was assessed by asking participants whether they had stopped taking the treatment and by counting the number of capsules remaining. If the participant did not bring the medication box with them to the follow-up, a member of the study team visited the participant's home to count the number of capsules remaining.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111swohR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Muller's muscle fibrosis is a possible predictive factor in the outcome of muller's muscle-conjunctival resection [^115PjcXE]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical procedure

All patients who had the inclusion criteria underwent MMCR surgery under local anesthesia by an oculoplastic surgeon (S.M.R). In order to perform open MMCR surgery, after prepping and draping, the patient's upper eyelid was everted using a Desmarres retractor and anesthesia was injected into the sub-Muller level. A surgical incision was made at the upper edge of the tarsus and Muller's muscle along with the conjunctiva were dissected together. Using a Vicryl 5 − 0 double-armed S11 needle, Muller's muscle was connected to the upper edge of the tarsus in the center with a new insertion and exited from the skin in the upper eyelid crease. After adjustment (based on the amount of ptosis, levator muscle function, and ptosis pathogenesis), two similar sutures were added on the medial and lateral sides. After the final tightening of all three sutures, the distance from the Muller edge to the new insertion site was measured and then the excess muscle was resected. At the end of the procedure, Muller's muscle sample along with the conjunctiva was sent to the pathology laboratory.

The eye was patched and the day after the surgery, after removing the bandage, 0.5% chloramphenicol eye drops, 0.5% erythromycin eye ointment, and lubricant eye drops were prescribed for two weeks. Then, on the 7th, 28th, and 90th days after the surgery, the patient was visited and the results of the surgery on the last visit were included in the study.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fRsBk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Ours is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis. We included 12 studies that assessed the effects of erythromycin or azithromycin, but we found no randomized studies that directly compared different drugs and no studies that evaluated trimethoprim. The certainty of evidence is low to very low because of the high risk of bias and the imprecision of the results across the studies. Overall, we found very large effects for cure for some treatments. We found high proportions of clinical (96%) and microbiological (97%) cure when erythromycin at 50 mg/kg per day was given in 4 divided doses for 14 days. These effects are large when compared to those with topical therapy alone. Several studies assessed topical therapy alone, and their microbiological cure ranged from 0% with chloramphenicol ointment to 78% with 1% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. We found some data from small individual studies that suggest that lower doses or shorter courses of erythromycin might reduce the proportion of neonates cured, but the evidence is uncertain because of the very low-quality evidence. Adverse gastrointestinal effects, including diarrhea, watery stools, vomiting, and abdominal pain, can occur in 14% of neonates receiving erythromycin and might be higher when the dose of erythromycin is not adjusted to the infant's weight. The only complication noted across the studies was scarring of the conjunctiva, which occurred in 6% (95% CI, −3% to 17%) of the neonates treated with erythromycin at 50 mg/kg per day for 14 days. We found 1 study that examined the efficacy of azithromycin in 12 neonates. Although it seems that clinical and microbiological cure rates might be lower with azithromycin than with the standard dose of erythromycin, we are very uncertain in this result. Also, very few data regarding adverse effects and complications of azithromycin have been reported. Evidence on compliance was sparse; however, given the less-frequent dosing of azithromycin, it is possible that its use could improve compliance. No studies in this review measured antibiotic resistance, but recent evidence suggests that antibiotic resistance is not currently an issue with C trachomatis infection.

### Diagnosis and treatment of filamentary keratitis in a patient with demodex infestation – an overlooked risk factor: a case report [^114xmBJF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1

Two weeks later, the patient complained of aggravation of symptoms. Slit-lamp examination revealed small corneal filaments in her left eye this time. Under topical anesthesia, the filaments were removed by forceps and bandage contact lenses were placed. Tobramycin dexamethasone eye ointment twice daily was also added to the former two drops by her doctor.

3 days later, she could not stand the aggravating ocular discomfort and resorted to our clinic this time. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal filaments in the interpalpebral zone of her left eye (Fig. 2, a). Meanwhile, eyelashes with cylindrical dandruff, lid margin hyperemia and foamy tears were noticed (Fig. 2, b-c). We therefore performed a microscopic examination of the eyelashes and a severe Demodex infestation was confirmed (Fig. 2, d). She denied systemic symptoms such as fatigue, xerostoma, arthralgia, muscular soreness, rashes and loss of appetite or nausea. Combined with her previous diagnosis, we added an additional diagnosis of Demodex blepharitis and long-term lid hygiene and warm compresses were advised. Lid scrub containing a 0.5% solution of tea tree oil twice daily and erythromycin eye ointment once daily were prescribed for Demodex blepharitis. Tobramycin dexamethasone eye ointment was replaced by the relatively low potency fluorometholone 0.02% eye drops. Antibiotic eye drops and artificial tears were continued.

### Mupirocin ointment (dermacinRx clorhexacin) [^114zN6hq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment USP, 2% in impetigo was tested in two studies. In the first, patients with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment USP, 2% or vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric patients included) were 71% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% and 62% for vehicle placebo. There were no side effects reported in the group receiving mupirocin ointment USP, 2%.

In the second study, patients with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment USP, 2% three times daily or 30 to 40 mg/kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day (this was an unblinded study) for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric patients included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable patient populations were 100% for both test groups. There were no side effects reported in the group receiving mupirocin ointment.

Pediatrics -

There were 91 pediatric patients aged 2 months to 15 years in the first study described above. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second study described above, all patients were pediatric except two adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment USP, 2%. The age range of the pediatric patients was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 27) was 96%, and for erythromycin it was unchanged (78.5%).

### Linear IgA disease: successful treatment with erythromycin [^113cMWRn]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Conventional first-line treatments for linear IgA disease (and the related chronic immunobullous disease of childhood) include topical steroids and dapsone, both of which may be associated with potentially serious side-effects. Alternative anti-inflammatory therapies such as tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics, have been used to treat other immunobullous disorders and we now report an adult case of linear IgA disease and a paediatric case of mixed immunobullous disease of childhood that both responded to the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin. The mode of action is speculative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are unclear. Nevertheless, from a clinical perspective, erythromycin may have a role in the treatment of linear IgA disease and could be considered ahead of many other, perhaps potentially more toxic, therapies.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^111cnRbZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — tetracycline safety, interactions, and contraindications — Tetracyclines can cause photosensitization, gastrointestinal upset, vaginitis, and, rarely, azotemia, and have been implicated in cases of pseudotumor cerebri, with metabolism that may alter the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and potentiate the effect of warfarin; a sustained-release preparation of doxycycline can be used to reduce side effects. Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy, for nursing women, and for patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, and tetracyclines also should not be used in children under 8 years of age since staining of teeth may occur; however, oral erythromycin or azithromycin may be substituted.

Basic and advanced eye kit contents — Wilderness eye kits include basic equipment and medications as well as advanced equipment and medications. Basic equipment includes a light source (light source: ideally would be penlight with blue filter, but bright headlamp is reasonable option), fluorescein strips, cotton-tipped applicators, and a paperclip for lid retraction, and basic medications include artificial tears (individual bullet packs to avoid contamination), erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment, proparacaine 0.5% drops, and oral pain medicine. Advanced equipment includes a metal eye shield, magnifying glass, fine forceps, a small needle, such as 23G or tuberculin syringe, a direct ophthalmoscope, and a wire speculum for lid retraction. Advanced medications include a fluoroquinolone ophthalmic eye drop, such as moxifloxacin 0.5%, prednisolone 1% drops, moxifloxacin 400 mg tablets, prednisone 20 mg tablets, atropine ophthalmic 1% ointment, pilocarpine 2% drops, Diamox oral 250 mg tablets, and a topical NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), such as ketorolac, diclofenac, or bromfenac eye drops. A basic kit is appropriate for short excursions, whereas the basic plus the advanced kit could be used for prolonged expeditions, especially to remote locations.

Dry eye syndrome staged management and treatment recommendations outline a stepwise approach. Step 1 includes "Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis", environmental modification, dietary education "including oral essential fatty acid supplementation", medication review, "Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)", and "Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 2 additions including "Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity", Demodex therapy with "Tea tree oil or lotilaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex", tear conservation with "Punctal occlusion" and "Moisture chamber spectacles/goggles", "Overnight treatments (such as ointment or moisture chamber devices)", "In-office, physical heating and expression of the meibomian glands (including thermal pulsation devices)", and prescription drugs to manage dry eye disease (DED) such as "Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)", "Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)", "Topical secretagogues", "Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)", "Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)", "Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)", "Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway", and "Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 3 options including "Oral secretagogues", "Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops", "Platelet-rich plasma eye drops", "Blood-based products", and therapeutic contact lenses including "Soft bandage lenses with caution" and "Rigid scleral lenses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 4 options including "Topical corticosteroid for longer duration", "Amniotic membrane grafts", "Surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery)", and "Other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation)". Notes state that "One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state", that options "are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid", that "The severity and etiology of the DED state will dictate the range and number of management options selected from one or more steps", and that prescription drug use "needs to be considered in the context of the individual patient presentation, and the relative level of evidence supporting their use for those specific indications".

### A phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of combined azithromycin and dexamethasone in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis [^1179MSRJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blepharoconjunctivitis is characterized by inflammation of the outer eyelids and the conjunctiva that results in redness and swelling. It is associated with increased bacterial colonization, especially with Staphylococcus species. It is diagnosed when there is simultaneous occurrence of blepharitis and conjunctivitis, and there are both inflammatory and bacterial components to the disorder.–If left untreated, blepharoconjunctivitis may lead to scarring of the eyelid and loss of proper eyelid function over time with secondary damage to the ocular surface. Several subtypes of blepharoconjunctivitis have been identified, including anterior disease, posterior disease (similar to blepharitis), angular blepharoconjunctivitis, seborrheic blepharoconjunctivitis, and atopic blepharoconjunctivitis, and different subtypes may require different treatment strategies. In atopic blepharoconjunctivitis, for example, an allergic component may be treated successfully with steroids, while a bacterial load would necessitate both antibiotics and steroids for an optimal and quick resolution.

Blepharoconjunctivitis commonly presents as diffuse inflammation of both the anterior and posterior lid margins as well as the conjunctiva and is usually associated with an increase in the local bacterial load. Discharge secondary to blepharoconjunctivitis is not uncommon, and may result in patients reporting eye dryness with eyelids stuck shut in the morning and the presence of greasy and/or crusty eyelashes. Although blepharoconjunctivitis is more common among individuals of middle age or older, it also has been reported in childhood.

In its chronic form, acute onset blepharoconjunctivitis can lead to lid ulceration that results in malposition of tear duct and/or corneal sequelae. Although viral or bacterial microorganisms may cause blepharoconjunctivitis, toxins produced by the Staphylococcal spp. (in particular Staphylococcus epidermis and aureus) have been implicated as a major cause of blepharoconjunctivitis. In general, S. epidermis and S. aureus are found in both the staphylococcal and mixed seborrheic-staphylococcal manifestations. Other organisms found when culturing the lids and conjunctiva in patients with blepharitis include Propionibacterium acnes and Corynebacteria.–

### Oral azithromycin versus doxycycline in meibomian gland dysfunction: a randomised double-masked open-label clinical trial [^115rXLWh]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin compared with oral doxycycline in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) who had failed to respond to prior conservative management.

Methods

110 patients (> 12years old) with MGD were randomly assigned to receive either oral 5-day azithromycin (500mg on day 1 and then 250mg/day) or 1-month doxycycline (200mg/day). They also continued eyelid warming/cleaning and artificial tears. A score comprising five symptoms and seven signs (primary outcome) was recorded prior to treatment and at 1week, and 1 and 2months after treatment. Total score was the sum of both scores at each follow-up. Side effects were recorded and overall clinical improvement was categorised as excellent, good, fair or poor based on the percentage of change in the total score.

Results

Symptoms and signs improved significantly in both groups (p = 0.001). While improvement of symptoms was not different between the groups, bulbar conjunctival redness (p = 0.004) and ocular surface staining (p = 0.01) were significantly better in the azithromycin group. The azithromycin group showed a significantly better overall clinical response (p = 0.01). Mild gastrointestinal side effects were not significantly different between the groups except for the second visit, when the doxycycline group had significantly more side effects (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Although both oral azithromycin and doxycycline improved the symptoms of MGD, 5-day oral azithromycin is recommended for its better effect on improving the signs, better overall clinical response and shorter duration of treatment.

Trial Registration Number

NCT01783860.

### Hydrocortisone concentration influences time to clinically significant healing of acute inflammation of the ocular surface and adnexa-results from a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112bkVaU]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of blepharitis, on the contrary, relies on eyelid hygiene, gentle lid massage, and warm compresses. Recently, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the antiseptic bibrocathol for the treatment of blepharitis. Topical antibiotics might be used in patients who do not respond to eyelid hygiene and, in severe cases, oral antibiotics and topical steroids may also be beneficial.

Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and other non-infectious inflammatory diseases of the anterior eye. Topical ophthalmic steroids inhibit the production of various inflammation-causing mediators, such as prostaglandins, which are released when the eye reacts to allergens. Despite being important and effective therapeutic candidates for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, their use is typically reserved for patients not responsive to other therapies or for use in acute and severe forms of allergy because of the potential side-effects (e.g. increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and risk of cataract formation). We report the results from a randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate whether higher concentrations of hydrocortisone acetate in the two eye ointments (i.e. Hydrocortisone acetate 2.5% and Hydrocortisone acetate 1%) are more effective in improving objective signs and subjective symptoms of non-infectious disease of the eye and ocular adnexa than the lower-concentrated Hydrocortisone acetate 0.5% eye ointment (concentration – response relationship).

### Oral azithromycin versus oral doxycycline in the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Hndz7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines throughout its planning, conduct, and reporting (as shown in). Additionally, the study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the identifier 447891.

Eligibility Criteria

The study selection process involved a comprehensive systematic review of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on patients with MGD. The inclusion criteria encompassed RCTs that specifically investigated the use of oral azithromycin as an intervention in comparison to oral doxycycline in managing patients with MGD with no improvement on conservative or topical management. Conversely, studies employing topical azithromycin as the main intervention were excluded from consideration. The primary outcomes of interest in this review included symptom score, sign score, and total score of MGD. Participants in the studies answered a questioner to assess symptom score, subjective score, based on categorical scale from 0 to 3. The questioner evaluated the symptoms of itchiness, burning sensation, foreign body sensation, dryness, and swelling of eyelid. Sign score was evaluated objectively also on a 4-points categorical scale by the examiner. Seven signs were evaluated that include meibomian secretion, plugged gland orifices, injection of conjunctiva, redness of lid margin, debris of lid margin, tear break up time, and staining of corneal surface by fluorescein. The sum of the sign and symptom scores calculated to for the total score. These outcomes were evaluated to assess the efficacy of oral azithromycin versus oral doxycycline in managing MGD. Additionally, gastrointestinal adverse events were appraised as a secondary outcome of interest.

Search Strategy

A systematic search of relevant literature was performed using the following databases: PubMed, the Cochrane Library (including clinical trials in CENTRAL), Scopus, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The search included the period from the inception of each database to 4 July 2023. The search terms used included "meibomian gland dysfunction", "meibomian gland disease", "blepharitis", "meibomianitis", "meibomitis", "ocular rosacea", "azithromycin", "macrolides", "doxycycline", and "tetracyclines" to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. In addition, the reference lists of included studies were manually checked to identify any additional relevant articles.

Holmstrom et alpointed out that the superior vault suspensory ligament and the levator palpebral muscle and superior rectus fascia sheath and Tenon capsule are connected, so the eyelid suspended to this ligament can move normally with the contraction of these muscles;
(2) Multiple literatures report that the double eyelid is not bloated after the surgery of fascial sheath suspension, and the eyelid eyeball movement is coordinated well, the postoperative eye-opening facial appearance is good, the incidence of postoperative blepharoplasty is lower, and the patient's discomfort is less. –,

In this study, the early corneal injury caused by the 2 methods may be related to the intraoperative mechanical damage to the cornea, the increased height of blepharoplasty, and the limitation of eyelid movement. The degree of corneal damage in the CFS group was lower than that in the frontal muscle flap suspension group, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at 3 months after surgery. Analysis of reasons: in the early frontal muscle flap suspension group, the upper eyelid and forehead were obviously swollen, the upper eyelid margin was higher, the eyelid ball was separated, and the eyelid and eyeball coordination was poor, which resulted in a large and long exposure of the cornea. In the CFS suspension group, the eyelid movement was relatively good, and the upper eyelid swelling was lighter, so the corneal injury was lighter. However, with the extension of healing time, at 3 months after surgery, the frontal swelling in the frontalis muscle flap suspension group gradually subsided, the upper eyelid margin position returned to the preoperative design level, the eyelid closure was improved, and the degree of corneal exposure was similar to that of the CFS group, so the cornea of the 2 groups gradually recovered and the difference gradually decreased. The factors affecting the tear film after surgery are as follows: all patients were given sodium hyaluronate eye drops after the surgery. Sodium hyaluronate eye drops is a kind of artificial tears that does not contain preservatives, reduces tear film damage and enhances the viscosity of ocular surface tissues. It can alleviate the impact of surgery on the tear film; after the operation, patients were routinely given erythromycin ointment based on petroleum jelly and paraffin for adjuvant treatment. Eye ointment adds a protective layer of lipid to the surface of the patient's tear film, thereby reducing the impact on BUT. In this article, the BUT in each time period after the surgery was higher than that before the surgery, and the difference was statistically significant. Even if the patient did not use any ophthalmic drugs within 2 hours before the BUT examination, this result is still considered to be closely related to the incompletely metabolized eye ointment and has no clinical reference significance. However, the ST and TMH values in each time period are similar, and there is no statistical difference. This result is considered to be related to many factors:

### Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment USP, 0.5% (sterile) [^112h1bv6]. FDA (DailyMed) (2016). Low credibility.

Each Gram Contains: ACTIVE: Erythromycin, USP 5 mg; INACTIVES: Mineral Oil, White Petrolatum. For the treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and/or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to erythromycin. For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae is not established. This drug is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to erythromycin. The use of antimicrobial agents may be associated with the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms including fungi; in such a case, antibiotic administration should be stopped and appropriate measures taken. Avoid contaminating the tip of container with material from the eye, fingers or other source. Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted.

No evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice, and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters, at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor ocular irritations, redness and hypersensitivity reactions. In the treatment of superficial ocular infections, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be applied directly to the infected eye up to six times daily, depending on the severity of the infection.

For prophylaxis of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia, a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac. The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following instillation. A new tube should be used for each infant.
