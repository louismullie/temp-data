## Question

A 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painful mass in her left breast for several days. She has no fevers or chills. She has not noticed any changes in the right breast. She has no history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Examination shows a palpable, mobile, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. Ultrasound shows a 1.75-cm, well-circumscribed anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. The patient says that she is very concerned that she may have breast cancer and wishes further diagnostic testing. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Fine needle aspiration
B. Mammogram
C. MRI scan of the left breast
D. Core needle biopsy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic test is most appropriate next for a 29-year-old woman who presents with a palpable, tender breast mass that on ultrasound shows classic features of a simple cyst, and who is concerned about the possibility of breast cancer and requests further testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's age and pretest probability of malignancy. Then, I should verify the ultrasound features and confirm whether they meet criteria for a simple cyst. Next, I will consider guideline-based management for simple cysts, including when aspiration is indicated. After that, I should review why mammography and MRI are not the next best steps here. Finally, I will weigh the patient's request for further testing and decide between fine-needle aspiration versus core needle biopsy, ensuring the choice aligns with evidence and patient-centered care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. At age 29, the baseline risk of breast cancer is very low, and ultrasound is the recommended first-line imaging modality for palpable masses in women under 30, which already places this lesion in a low-suspicion pathway unless imaging features are worrisome [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g].

> Wait, let me verify the ultrasound characterization. The description of a well-circumscribed, anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement is classic for a simple cyst, which by BI-RADS is categorized as benign (BI-RADS 2) and carries essentially no malignant potential, so no tissue diagnosis is required based on imaging alone [^116SYYuA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intervention. I initially thought "simple cysts do not require aspiration", but I should double-check the nuance: simple cysts are managed conservatively unless symptomatic, in which case aspiration can be offered for relief of pain or tenderness, with typical cyst fluid discarded and cytology reserved for atypical or bloody fluid, so aspiration is reasonable here for symptom control if the patient desires it [^114GicdH].

> Next, I should review why mammography is not the next step. Mammography is less sensitive in women under 40 and is not indicated as the initial test for a palpable mass in a woman under 30; even in women 30–39, ultrasound is often preferred first, and in this case the ultrasound already confidently diagnosed a simple cyst, so mammography would not add value and could increase false positives without changing management [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking MRI. MRI is rarely indicated in the routine diagnostic evaluation of a clinically detected palpable mass, especially when ultrasound already provides a definitive benign diagnosis; MRI is reserved for selected high-risk scenarios or problem-solving, not for a straightforward simple cyst in a low-risk patient [^114st56g].

> Now, I will examine the biopsy options in light of the patient's request for further testing. Fine-needle aspiration is the least invasive, rapid, and cost-effective way to confirm cystic nature and provide symptomatic relief if fluid is aspirated; cytology is generally unnecessary for typical clear cyst fluid, but the procedure addresses the patient's anxiety by providing a tangible answer and immediate symptom improvement if the cyst is drained [^114eGvcP] [^114GicdH].

> But wait, what if I consider core needle biopsy instead? Core needle biopsy is more invasive, requires local anesthesia, and is indicated for solid or suspicious lesions. Using it for a clearly simple cyst would be overtreatment and exposes the patient to unnecessary risks and costs, so core biopsy is not appropriate here [^114eGvcP] [^115JBhqQ].

> Let me reconsider the management pathway to ensure concordance with guidelines. The most appropriate next step is ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for symptomatic relief and confirmation of cystic nature; if the fluid is clear and the mass resolves, no further workup is needed, whereas atypical or bloody fluid would prompt cytology and further evaluation, which aligns with evidence-based care for simple cysts and with the patient's request for additional testing [^114GicdH].

> Final answer: Fine needle aspiration is the most appropriate next step to provide symptomatic relief and confirm the benign diagnosis in a manner that is minimally invasive and guideline-concordant, reserving further intervention only for atypical findings or patient-specific risk factors [^114GicdH] [^115JBhqQ].

---

The most appropriate next step is **fine needle aspiration (FNA)** [^114GicdH] because the ultrasound shows a classic simple cyst (anechoic, well-circumscribed, posterior enhancement) [^116SYYuA], which is benign and requires no biopsy [^114GicdH]. FNA is both diagnostic and therapeutic: it confirms the cyst, relieves pain, and avoids unnecessary surgery or radiation [^111efgS8]. Mammography is not indicated in women under 30 unless there are suspicious features [^115JBhqQ], MRI is not appropriate for routine cyst evaluation [^114st56g], and core needle biopsy is invasive and unnecessary for a simple cyst [^114GicdH].

---

## Clinical evaluation and imaging findings

- **Clinical findings**: palpable, mobile, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast, no systemic symptoms (fever, chills), no changes in the right breast.

- **Ultrasound findings**: 1.75-cm, well-circumscribed, anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement — classic features of a simple cyst [^116SYYuA].

- **Assessment**: simple cysts are benign, fluid-filled lesions with no malignant potential, typically managed conservatively unless symptomatic [^114GicdH].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a palpable breast mass in a 29-year-old woman includes:

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Imaging features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Simple cyst | - Mobile <br/> - Tender <br/> - Fluctuant | - Anechoic <br/> - Well-circumscribed <br/> - Posterior enhancement [^116SYYuA] | - Observation or aspiration if symptomatic [^114GicdH] |
| Fibroadenoma | - Firm <br/> - Mobile <br/> - Non-tender | - Solid <br/> - Well-circumscribed <br/> - Hypoechoic [^113vqr4K] | - Observation or excision if large or symptomatic [^114qRkyD] |
| Breast abscess | - Painful <br/> - Erythematous <br/> - Fever | - Complex fluid collection <br/> - Surrounding edema | - Antibiotics and drainage [^notfound] |
| Breast cancer | - Firm <br/> - Irregular <br/> - Non-mobile | - Irregular <br/> - Hypoechoic <br/> - Posterior shadowing [^notfound] | - Biopsy and oncologic management |

---

Given the ultrasound features and clinical presentation, a **simple cyst** is the most likely diagnosis [^116SYYuA].

---

## Recommended next step: fine needle aspiration (FNA)

FNA is the **most appropriate next step** for the following reasons:

- **Diagnostic confirmation**: FNA confirms the cystic nature of the lesion and excludes malignancy [^114eGvcP].

- **Therapeutic relief**: Aspiration of cyst fluid provides immediate relief of pain and discomfort [^notfound].

- **Minimally invasive**: FNA is less invasive than core needle biopsy or surgical excision, with minimal risk of complications [^114eGvcP].

- **Avoidance of unnecessary procedures**: FNA prevents unnecessary mammography, MRI, or surgical intervention in a clearly benign lesion [^notfound].

---

## Rationale against other options

- **Mammogram**: Not indicated as the initial imaging modality in women under 30 years old unless there are suspicious features or high-risk factors [^115JBhqQ].

- **MRI scan**: Not indicated for routine evaluation of simple cysts due to low specificity, high cost, and unnecessary radiation exposure [^114st56g].

- **Core needle biopsy**: Invasive and unnecessary for a simple cyst, reserved for solid or suspicious lesions [^114GicdH].

---

## Patient counseling and follow-up

Counsel the patient that the ultrasound findings are consistent with a **benign simple cyst**, which has no malignant potential [^116SYYuA]. Explain that FNA will confirm the diagnosis and provide immediate symptom relief, and reassure her that no further intervention is needed if the cyst resolves and symptoms abate. Arrange follow-up to ensure resolution and symptom improvement, with further evaluation only if the mass persists or new symptoms develop.

---

Fine needle aspiration is the **most appropriate next step** for this patient, providing diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic relief while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures [^114eGvcP].

Tubular adenoma

Tubular adenoma is a rare benign tumor of the breast representing 0.13%-2.9% of all benign breast neoplasms. It is more frequently seen in younger women of childbearing age. Although tubular adenoma and fibroadenoma are both epithelial tumors, a tubular adenoma is histologically distinguished from a fibroadenoma by its tightly packed tubular or acinar epithelium and sparse connective tissue. Conversely, a fibroadenoma has an extensive connective tissue component. Despite this, the cytologic features of tubular adenoma may still resemble those of a fibroadenoma. Therefore, histopathology remains key for confirmation of this diagnosis. Like fibroadenomas, tubular adenomas are not known to increase the risk of cancer, and in contrast to fibroadenomas, are not associated with pregnancy or oral contraceptive use.

Both fibroadenomas and tubular adenomas present as circumscribed masses and are occasionally palpable. Mammographically, tubular adenomas have been associated with tightly grouped microcalcifications, which can be suspicious in morphology and may warrant biopsy. Sonographically, tubular adenomas usually present as oval parallel masses with circumscribed margins, similar to fibroadenomas; however, tubular adenomas can also present as irregular hypoechoic masses (Fig. 13). Management should be determined by the clinical examination, imaging studies, and core biopsy results. In many cases, as with a growing breast mass, surgical excision should be considered to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

Fibroepithelial lesion surveillance after non-excision and post-excision follow-up: In clinical scenarios where FELs on core needle biopsy are not excised, patients should undergo surveillance with clinical examination and ipsilateral breast imaging at 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis to evaluate for clinical change. If substantive clinical progression is identified, ie, more than expected benign growth is observed or new suspicious morphologic features develop, then surgical excision should be performed otherwise patients can return to age-appropriate screening. Patients undergoing excision of a BPT do not require ongoing imaging or clinical examination follow-up and can return to age-appropriate screening.

### Benign breast disease [^114qgSMA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Benign breast diseases are among the most common diagnoses that the busy obstetrician-gynecologist will see in practice. Moreover, breast cancer will undoubtedly be diagnosed numerous times in an obstetrician-gynecologist's career. An ability to accurately and promptly diagnose both benign and malignant breast diseases is within the purview of the generalist obstetrician-gynecologist. A thorough understanding of benign breast diseases, including appropriate diagnostic techniques, is vitally important in well-women care. In addition, a working knowledge of breast cancer risk factors with the ability to identify women at high risk and either refer or initiate risk reduction methods is equally important. This review outlines common benign breast diseases stratified by future risk of breast cancer and discusses appropriate management after diagnosis.

Benign simple breast cysts are commonly seen in female breasts and can present as palpable masses. They are distinctly uncommon, however, in the male breast. We report a case of simple benign cyst of the breast in a 58-year-old man newly diagnosed with mantel cell lymphoma. The cyst was first identified incidentally on a staging contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography. Further evaluation with mammography and ultrasound revealed a mass that would be typically characterized as a benign simple cyst, but was biopsied since cysts are not known to occur in male breasts. Pathology results from ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed benign cyst and focal fibrosis which was concordant with the imaging findings. In this case report, we will briefly discuss breast cysts in men and their imaging features including mammography and ultrasound.

### Assessment and management of challenging BI-RADS category 3 mammographic lesions [^114op1Ue]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 lesions are probably benign by definition and are recommended for short-interval follow-up after a diagnostic workup has been completed. Although the original lexicon-derived BI-RADS category 3 definition applied to lesions without prior imaging studies (when stability could not be determined), in clinical practice, many lesions with prior images may be assigned to BI-RADS category 3. Although the BI-RADS fifth edition specifically delineates lesions that are appropriate for categorization as probably benign, it also specifies that the interpreting radiologist may use his or her discretion and experience to justify a "watchful waiting" approach for lesions that do not meet established criteria. Examples of such lesions include evolving masses or calcifications suggestive of prior trauma and instances when stability cannot be ascertained because of image quality. Although interval change is an important feature of malignancy, many benign lesions also change over time; thus, use of prior imaging studies and ongoing imaging surveillance to demonstrate the evolution of a probably benign lesion is justified. Some examples of common pitfalls associated with inappropriate BI-RADS category 3 assessment include failure to use proper BI-RADS descriptors, failure to perform a complete diagnostic workup, and overreliance on negative ultrasonographic findings. When appropriately used, short-interval follow-up saves many patients from undergoing biopsy of benign lesions, without decreasing the rate of cancer detection. (©)RSNA, 2016.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: radiological-pathological correlation [^114AXuPS]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Galactocele

It is the most common benign breast lesion in lactating women and can present in the third trimester, after delivery, or even after cessation of breast feeding. Galactoceles typically occur as a result of an obstructed duct leading to distension of proximal lobular segments. Patients most often present with a tender mass. The imaging appearance of galactocele is variable, depending on the amount of fat, protein and water content. On mammography, a mass with a fat-fluid level on the lateral projection is a diagnostic sign in the appropriate clinical setting. (Fig. 10a), The presence of solid, mobile echogenic contents with distal acoustic shadowing in a fluid-filled cavity on ultrasound, is considered to be highly suggestive of a galactocele. On ultrasound, most lesions appear benign with thin, well-circumscribed margins; the internal appearance may be homogeneous with low level echoes or heterogeneous, depending on its contents. It may appear multicystic or have a complex echotexture (Fig. 10b, c). The margins vary from well-defined to ill-defined, depending upon the amount of surrounding inflammation. Histopathology reveals cuboidal and flat epithelial-lined cysts often accompanied by inflammatory and/or necrotic debris (Fig. 10d). If asymptomatic, or if typical with a fat-fluid level, galactoceles can be managed conservatively.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^11458YPq]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Breast high-risk lesion evaluation and excision decision-making — Patients with clinical or imaging findings that are discordant with core needle biopsy (CNB) histology should undergo excision, and consideration can be given to repeat biopsy if the initial biopsy procedure was felt to be inadequate. Selective excision for the remaining patients is recommended, and the final decision to excise depends on shared decision making with the patient and includes careful clinical, imaging, and pathology concordance assessment with multidisciplinary input, patient-specific estimates of the risk of upgrade to malignancy, disclosure of operative and cosmetic risks, and whether the patient can or will comply with follow-up. All patients should undergo comprehensive breast cancer risk assessment and be considered for risk reducing medication and high-risk screening as appropriate; the presence of a high-risk lesion is not an indication for genetic testing; however, all patients should be evaluated for personal or family history that would indicate that genetic evaluation is appropriate. Certain high-risk lesions such as lobular neoplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia are associated with elevated lifetime breast cancer risk which is not mitigated by surgical excision, and these recommendations assume that the pathology and imaging results are deemed concordant.

### Practice bulletin no. 164 summary: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^112edudB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Breast-related symptoms are among the most common reasons women present to obstetrician-gynecologists. Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a favorable position to diagnose benign breast disease in their patients. The purpose of a thorough understanding of benign breast disease is threefold: 1) to alleviate, when possible, symptoms attributable to benign breast disease, 2) to distinguish benign from malignant breast disease, and 3) to identify patients with an increased risk of breast cancer so that increased surveillance or preventive therapy can be initiated. Obstetrician-gynecologists may perform diagnostic procedures when indicated or may make referrals to physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of breast disease. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to outline common benign breast disease symptoms in women who are not pregnant or lactating and discuss appropriate evaluation and management. The obstetrician-gynecologist's role in the screening and management of breast cancer is beyond the scope of this document and is addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1–3).

### BI-RADS 3 on screening breast ultrasound: what is It and what is the appropriate management? [^1153BE8G]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

US is widely used in breast imaging for diagnostic purposes and is also used increasingly for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. US frequently depicts masses that are occult on mammography, even after tomosynthesis, and the vast majority of such masses are benign. Many masses seen only on screening US are easily recognized as benign simple cysts. Probably benign, BI-RADS 3, or low suspicion, BI-RADS 4A masses are also common and often prompt short-interval follow-up or biopsy, respectively, yet the vast majority of these are benign. This review details appropriate characterization, classification, and new approaches to the management of probably benign masses seen on screening US that can reduce false positives and, thereby, reduce costs and patient anxiety.

### The sonographic findings and differing clinical implications of simple, complicated, and complex breast cysts [^112H3iA7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Although palpable and mammographic breast masses are common and frequently reflect underlying fibrocystic change, they must be distinguished from breast malignancy. Clinical characterization of these masses is often unreliable, and mammographic appearances alone cannot distinguish between those that are solid and those that are cystic. Sonography is an important adjunct to characterize these abnormalities further. Management of solid masses is well established, but overlap in appearance of cystic lesions has led to variability in reporting and management. With current high-resolution ultrasound, specific observations can accurately characterize most cystic masses, thereby facilitating management decisions.

### Mastitis… [^114sgzah]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Mastitis is inflammation of the breast or udder, usually associated with breastfeeding. Symptoms typically include local pain and redness. There is often an associated fever and general soreness. Onset is typically fairly rapid and usually occurs within the first few months of delivery. Complications can include abscess formation. Types When it occurs in breastfeeding mothers, it is known as puerperal mastitis, lactation mastitis, or lactational mastitis. When it occurs in non breastfeeding women it is known as non-puerperal or non-lactational mastitis. Mastitis can, in rare cases, occur in men. Inflammatory breast cancer has symptoms very similar to mastitis and must be ruled out. The symptoms are similar for puerperal and nonpuerperal mastitis but predisposing factors and treatment can be very different. Pregnancy related Puerperal mastitis is the inflammation of the breast in connection with pregnancy, breastfeeding or weaning.

Since one of the most prominent symptoms is tension and engorgement of the breast, it is thought to be caused by blocked milk ducts or milk excess. It is relatively common; estimates range depending on methodology between 5–33%. However, only about 0. 4–0. 5% of breastfeeding mothers develop an abscess. Some predisposing factors are known but their predictive value is minimal. It appears that proper breastfeeding technique, frequent breastfeeding and avoidance of stress are the most important factors that can be influenced. Light cases of mastitis are often called breast engorgement; the distinction is overlapping and possibly arbitrary or subject to regional variations. Signs and symptoms Lactation mastitis usually affects only one breast and the symptoms can develop quickly. It develops into three stages, from the initial stage, the pus formation stage, to the restoration stage. The signs and symptoms usually appear suddenly and they include:

- Breast tenderness or warmth to the touch
- General malaise or feeling ill
- Swelling of the breast
- Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding
- Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern
- Fever of 101 F or greater
- The affected breast can then start to appear lumpy and red. Some women may also experience flu-like symptoms such as:

- Aches
- Shivering and chills
- Feeling anxious or stressed
- Fatigue Contact should be made with a health care provider with special breastfeeding competence as soon as the patient recognizes the combination of signs and symptoms. Most of the women first experience the flu-like symptoms and just after they may notice a sore red area on the breast. Also, women should seek medical care if they notice any abnormal discharge from the nipples, if breast pain is making it difficult to function each day, or they have prolonged, unexplained breast pain.

Causes Since the 1980s mastitis has often been divided into non-infectious and infectious sub-groups. However, recent research suggests that it may not be feasible to make divisions in this way. It has been shown that types and amounts of potentially pathogenic bacteria in breast milk are not correlated to the severity of symptoms. Moreover, although only 15% of women with mastitis in Kvist et al. 's study were given antibiotics, all recovered and few had recurring symptoms. Many healthy breastfeeding women wishing to donate breast milk have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their milk but have no symptoms of mastitis. Women who are breastfeeding are at risk for developing mastitis especially if they have sore or cracked nipples or have had mastitis before while breastfeeding another baby. Also, the chances of getting mastitis increases if women use only one position to breastfeed or wear a tight-fitting bra, which may restrict milk flow.

### Breast lesions in women aged younger than 30 years: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^1153y2fk]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Women aged younger than 30 years frequently present with palpable breast lesions, breast pain, and nipple discharge. Diagnostic work-up often results in benign findings, including a variety of benign solid masses, infectious or inflammatory conditions, pregnancy- or lactation-related abnormalities, and normal variants. While rare, breast cancer can occur within this demographic, and it is often more advanced and aggressive than in older women. Other rare tumors can present within this patient demographic, including primary sarcoma of the breast and granular cell tumors. A knowledge of the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management of this spectrum of pathologic entities is crucial to ensure optimal and cost-effective care within this patient demographic.

### Assessment of 1183 screen-detected, category 3B, circumscribed masses by cytology and core biopsy with long-term follow up data [^112pEwiA]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Discrete, circumscribed masses constitute one of the most common groups of lesions encountered during mammographic screening for breast cancer. Such lesions are encountered in approximately 8% of all screening mammograms and most are benign.

In the setting of mammographic screening for breast cancer, lesions with characteristically benign mammographic features do not require further assessment. When the mammographic features are not entirely typical of benign lesions, recall for further imaging assessment is indicated. The use of specific imaging techniques, such as magnification views, spot compression and sonography enable radiologists to diagnose cystic lesions and visualise lesions' contours better, thus determining the benign nature of a high proportion of such lesions with confidence. However, some cases remain indeterminate despite the additional imaging. Several options are available as the next steps in the management of such lesions. These include surgical excision, core biopsy, fine needle aspiration biopsy or mammographic surveillance.

In the setting of population based screening for breast cancer, where most screen-detected lesions are likely to be benign, the aim to minimise the morbidity associated with cancer screening requires that the use of surgical biopsy be strictly limited to those few cases where imaging and needle biopsy techniques cannot determine the nature of the lesion. Apart from the desire to minimise surgery for benign disease, the large case volume discourages widespread use of open biopsy, and to a lesser extent core biopsy, for pragmatic and economic reasons. The strategy of short-term mammographic follow up is supported by long-term follow up data. However, since delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer is a source of anxiety for women and their doctors, some clinicians may be uncomfortable with this approach. In this regard, Sickles notes that while patients are initially enthusiastic about the option of short-term mammographic follow up, compliance with the full surveillance protocol was only 45%.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a cost-effective method of investigating breast lesions. In experienced hands and for appropriately selected lesions this test is clinically useful and reliable. In our programme we use FNAB as a first line diagnostic modality for the assessment of category 3 mass lesions, supplemented where necessary, by core biopsy and surgical biopsy. In the light of the increasing use of core biopsy in preference to FNAB by other programmes, we wished to establish the reliability of benign cytology for this specific category of screen-detected masses through review of long-term outcome data.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^116693r4]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

In most countries, a structured reporting and classification system is adopted for describing breast US findings and guiding management. In some European countries, especially in the United Kingdom, a five-level scale from U1 to U5 is used, where U stands for US. U1 means normal (no abnormalities), U2 benign abnormal findings, U3 indeterminate (equivocal)/probably benign findings, U4 findings suspicious of malignancy, U5, findings highly suspicious of malignancy. The most commonly applied system is the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS). BI-RADS 1 means normal (no abnormalities), BI-RADS 2 benign abnormal findings, BI-RADS 3 probably benign findings (for which a short-interval – typically 6-month – follow-up is recommended), BI-RADS 4 suspicious findings for which needle biopsy is recommended, BI-RADS 5 findings highly suggestive for malignancy for which needle biopsy is recommended, BI-RADS 6 known biopsy-proven malignancy (reserved for US examinations performed made for cancer staging or monitoring of neo-adjuvant therapy). Finally, this system also includes a BI-RADS 0 category, which is used for incomplete/inconclusive tests requiring additional imaging evaluation. Note that both the U4/BI-RADS 4 and U5/BI-RADS 5 diagnostic categories require tissue sampling through biopsy. In contrast to the U3 category (which includes cases with a relatively higher probability of cancer), the BI-RADS 3 category implies a low cancer risk (lower than 2%) and requires short term (usually 6 months) follow-up but may also be biopsied if the patient requests it or when follow-up is deemed difficult.
Note G. Even though the use of stardardised assessment categories facilitates the understanding of the report, do not hesitate to discuss unclear issues of your US examination with your breast radiologist. Do this in particular in the case of U3 or BI-RADS 3, if you are wondering about the need to undergo a needle biopsy or you are thinking of postponing the needle biopsy, as well as in the case of U4/BI-RADS 4 or U5/BI-RADS 5 and when further imaging work-up is suggested (e.g. digital breast tomosynthesis, MRI).

### Comparison of two protocols for the management of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with adnexal tumours-a randomised controlled trial of RMI / RCOG vs simple rules [^113TcuER]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Initial management

Out of the 44 women triaged for surgery in the RMI/RCOG arm, 18 (40.9%) had surgery as planned, 7 (15.9%) were not fit for surgery and 19 (43.2%) declined the operation for various reasons. All women who declined surgery were in the intermediate-risk group. All five women assigned to surgery in the SRMP arm had operations.

Thus, following the initial assessment, 18 out of 73 (24.7%) RMI/RCOG patients had surgery compared to 5 out of 75 (6.7%) SRMP. There is strong evidence that the rate of surgery is higher for RMI/RCOG patients (P = 0.003, χ 2 -test). The difference in these proportions is 18.0% (95% CI: 6.6–29.4%) and the RR is 3.70 (95% CI: 1.45–9.44).

Primary analysis: management at 12 months ('ITT' analysis)

The surgical status of 136 patients is known at 12 months. There were two women who had surgery during follow-up. One woman was offered surgery because of her personal recent diagnosis of breast cancer and the other was diagnosed with an early endometrial cancer. They were both in the SRMP arm, both operated on by gynaecological oncologists and both adnexal lesions were benign on histological examination. Neither woman had yet had her first follow-up ultrasound scan. After completion of follow-up, 18 out of 68 (26.5%) RMI/RCOG patients had surgery compared to 7 out of 68 (10.3%) in the SRMP arm (Tables 2 and 3). There is strong evidence that the rate of surgery is higher for RMI/RCOG patients (P = 0.015, χ 2 -test). The difference in these proportions is 16.2% (95% CI: 3.4–28.9%) so, therefore, for every 100 patients we expect an additional 16 patients to have surgery after assessment by RMI/RCOG compared to assessment via Simple Rules. The RR is 2.57 (95% CI: 1.15–5.76), so there is a 2.6 times higher chance of surgery following assessment by RMI/RCOG compared to assessment via Simple Rules.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^1134CNxv]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of high-risk lesions occurs frequently and incidentally at percutaneous biopsy, following suspicious imaging findings such as distortion, a group of microcalcifications, or even a mass. Traditionally, high-risk lesions are managed with surgical excision because of their low but latent potential of upgrade to malignancy. The most recent guidelines recommend a more conservative approach, sparing open surgery when this can be avoided. This trend has been adopted for the continued concerns raised regarding potential harms associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgeries when suspicious imaging findings are found. Further, radiological follow-up by means of mammography and breast MRI should be considered in patients diagnosed with high-risk lesions as they are not only non-obligate precursors of malignancy but also risk indicators for the homolateral and contralateral breast. It is essential that management of high-risk lesions takes on a multidisciplinary approach with close communication between all members of the breast team (surgeon, pathologist, oncologist, geneticist, radiotherapist) to assess the individual risk of patients with such a diagnosis and their suitability for either surgical excision or imaging surveillance.

### Breast ultrasound [^114mwK6C]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is second in importance only to mammography in the evaluation of breast abnormalities. The ability of US to diagnose benign simple cysts accurately has spared innumerable women from needless biopsies and aspirations. When a suspicious solid abnormality is detected by ultrasound, it readily provides convenient, inexpensive, accurate imaging guidance for interventional procedures. Future studies of US as a screening tool must weigh potential benefits against the potential risks because of increased biopsies performed for false-positive results.

### Palpable right breast mass in a pregnant woman [^1125kgdx]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

A 29-year-old female presented with a palpable right breast mass at a 12-week prenatal visit. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Ultrasound revealed a 3 cm lobulated mass, which was confirmed to be malignant by a core biopsy. Postmastectomy pathology at 15 weeks' gestation demonstrated this mass to be a stage T2N0M0 high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma with 0/20 axillary nodes involved. A staging CT scan postpartum showed an enlarged right internal mammary lymph node, confirmed by MRI as suspicious for malignancy.

Investigations

Physical examination, breast ultrasound, core biopsy, mastectomy, CT scan, MRI.

Diagnosis

Pregnancy-associated breast carcinoma.

Management

Mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

### Excisional breast biopsy [^112N3cZZ]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Excisional breast biopsy — quality assessment and improvement emphasizes that core biopsy is sufficient for diagnosis of most benign breast lesions and > 90% of breast cancers, and that diagnostic excisional biopsy should be the exception, not the rule. Specimen x-ray or ultrasound to confirm removal of the target lesion is required for all excisional biopsies of non-palpable lesions. An institution-specific protocol should be in place for excisional breast biopsy, covering all aspects of the procedure and satisfactory to the surgeons, OR staff, radiologists, and pathologists involved. A policy for ongoing review of emerging evidence regarding the indications and outcomes of excisional breast biopsy should be in place. The medical record should document a plan for the post-surgical care and long-term follow-up of excisional breast biopsy, including the timing and type of breast imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria evaluation of the symptomatic male breast [^111FC5se]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Most male breast problems are benign, and men with typical symptoms of gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia do not usually need imaging. When a differentiation between benign disease and breast cancer cannot be made on the basis of clinical findings or when the clinical findings are suspicious for breast cancer, imaging is indicated. Mammography is useful in both identifying cancer and obviating the need for biopsy in patients for whom a benign mammographic impression confirms the clinical impression. However, because of the relationship of breast cancer to increasing age, age-based protocols that do not include mammography have been developed. For men with an indeterminate palpable mass, begin with ultrasound if the patient is < 25 years of age, because breast cancer is highly unlikely. Mammography should be performed if ultrasound is suspicious. For men ≥ 25 years of age or having a highly concerning physical examination, usually begin with mammography; ultrasound is useful if mammography is inconclusive or suspicious. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Breast imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and management of breast disease. From screening asymptomatic patients to evaluating clinical abnormalities on diagnostic studies, breast imaging provides critical information to the breast surgeon. Available imaging studies include those that have been proved over many years, like mammography, and those that take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology, like breast MRI. Image-guided biopsy provides a safe means of evaluating indeterminate findings on imaging. Understanding how these tools are best used can help breast surgeons provide the best care for their patients.

### First International Consensus Report on adnexal masses: management recommendations [^1134QZKG]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The First International Consensus Conference on Adnexal Masses was convened to thoroughly examine the state of the science and to formulate recommendations for clinical assessment and management. The panel included representatives of societies in the fields of gynecology, gynecologic oncology, radiology, and pathology and clinicians from Europe, Canada, and the United States. In the United States, there are approximately 9.1 surgeries per malignancy compared to the European International Ovarian Tumor Analysis center trials, with only 2.3 (oncology centers) and 5.9 (other centers) reported surgeries per malignancy, suggesting that there is room to improve our preoperative assessments. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on "Management of Adnexal Masses", reaffirmed in 2015 (Obstet Gynecol 2007; 110:201–214), still states, "With the exception of simple cysts on a transvaginal ultrasound finding, most pelvic masses in postmenopausal women will require surgical intervention". The panel concluded that patients would benefit not only from a more conservative approach to many benign adnexal masses but also from optimization of physician referral patterns to a gynecologic oncologist in cases of suspected ovarian malignancies. A number of next-step options were offered to aid in management of cases with sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses. This process would provide an opportunity to improve risk stratification for indeterminate masses via the provision of alternatives, including but not limited to evidence-based risk-assessment algorithms and referral to an "expert sonologist" or to a gynecologic oncologist. The panel believed that these efforts to improve clinical management and preoperative triage patterns would ultimately improve patient care.

Breast cancer during lactation — epidemiology and clinical implications: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in their reproductive years and thus may present during lactation, and breastfeeding women are at risk for postpartum breast cancer, which has higher risk of metastatic spread than other forms of breast cancer. Women with postpartum breast cancer have markedly lower 5-year overall survival when compared with nulliparous cases, even adjusting for biologic subtype and stage at diagnosis (III). Diagnosis is established histologically, and management is multidisciplinary and complex, tailored to the individual patient.

### Complicated breast cysts on sonography: is aspiration necessary to exclude malignancy? [^114ULLCk]. Academic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To determine the incidence of breast cancer in women presenting for fine needle aspiration of sonographically diagnosed complicated breast cysts.

Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. A retrospective study was performed of 186 consecutive women who presented for fine needle aspiration of 243 sonographic complicated cysts detected by clinical examination or imaging between January 2002 and August 2003. Sonographic complicated cysts were defined as those meeting most but not all criteria for simple cysts similar to current Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification. We excluded solid masses, cysts with solid components, intracystic masses, and simple cysts. Prospective mammography, ultrasound, and procedure reports were reviewed. A case was considered positive if cytology, core needle biopsy, or surgical excision was positive for cancer. Final diagnosis was established by biopsy, cytology, clinical resolution, or stability over time.

Results

One of 243 (0.4%) lesions proved malignant (95% confidence interval 0–1.94%); 210/243 (86.4%) of cases yielded fluid on aspiration. Of 141 samples submitted to cytology, 138 (97.9%) were benign and 3 (2.1%) atypical. All cases of atypia were benign at surgical excision. Ninety five of 243 (39.1%) aspiration samples with typical cyst fluid were discarded. A total of 33/243 (13.6%) cases did not yield fluid, 1 of which was positive for cancer. Thirty cases underwent core needle or excisional biopsy for imaging discordance with benign results.

Conclusions

Breast cancer presenting as a complicated cyst by ultrasound was rare (0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0–1.94%). These results provide support for classification of complicated cysts as probably benign.

### Understanding BI-RADS category 3 [^113gqAFD]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 assessment is used for breast imaging findings considered "probably benign", with less than a 2% likelihood of malignancy. It is used to increase specificity by decreasing the number of breast biopsies. It has been validated for mammography, breast US, and emerging indications for use in contrast-enhanced breast MRI. Despite the long-term use of category 3 and numerous published studies that evaluate characteristic imaging findings appropriate for this category, there is still misuse and confusion regarding its accurate use. Imaging findings classified as category 3 require short-term follow-up to assess stability and identify changes that may warrant a biopsy for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Category 3 should not be used in a screening study without a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation that may reveal suspicious features or downgrade a finding to benign. In mammography, category 3 findings are validated for grouped round calcifications, oval circumscribed masses, and nonpalpable asymmetries. In US, category 3 can be applied to oval circumscribed parallel solid masses and complicated cysts. Category 3 can be assigned to clustered microcysts when they are very small or deep in the breast. Recent studies have yielded characteristic findings appropriate for MRI category 3 that are expected to be included in the sixth edition of the BI-RADS atlas. These include oval circumscribed masses with associated T2-hyperintense signal, focal non-mass enhancement, and foci of enhancement with associated T 2-hyperintense signal. Surveillance with short-interval imaging enables radiologists to monitor findings and act early when a change is detected. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^117AhdTb]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Notably, breast US also detects a variety of non-palpable benign lesions, which are very common in the breast but may otherwise have gone unnoticed, sometimes requiring needle biopsy, showing their benignancy (false positives). This is one of the major drawbacks of the use of breast US as a screening tool. A systematic review of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts reported very low positive predictive value of both handheld and automated breast US (from 3.2 to 7.5%) and a biopsy rate as high as about 6%.

Invasive cancers not visible or not detected on US are in general either very small, behind the nipple or lesions which are difficult to distinguish from normal gland or fat tissue or from fibrocystic changes, such as invasive lobular cancers, accounting for up to 15% of all breast cancers. US may also miss microinvasive cancers and diffusely growing cancers. Accordingly, suspicious findings at clinical examination, mammography, or MRI should not be dismissed because of a normal US, even when US has been targeted to the region thought to harbour the finding. Moreover, US is less sensitive than mammography for non-invasive breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) commonly detected at mammography due to the presence of calcifications.
Note D. When both mammography and breast US are requested, US should be performed after mammography. The best scenario is that both mammography and US are evaluated at the same time from the same radiologist providing a unique conclusion from the two examinations. Your radiologist may recommend an adjunct US if you have very dense breasts and a negative mammogram, also taking into account other risk factors. If you feel a palpable lump, US may be the first-line examination used, especially before 40 years of age.

### The evaluation of common breast problems… [^116An8yb]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Breast disease in women encompasses a spectrum of benign and malignant disorders. The frequency of breast cancer varies with the age of the patient and the presenting complaint. Breast pain, a nipple discharge and a palpable mass are the most common breast problems for which women consult a physician. Regardless of the type of breast problem, the goal of the evaluation is to rule out cancer and address the patient's symptoms. The extent of the evaluation required to accomplish this goal varies with the type of clinical problem and the patient's age and risk status. This article reviews the presentation and management of common breast problems. Breast Pain Mastalgia is more common in pre-menopausal women than in postmenopausal women, and it is rarely a presenting symptom of breast cancer. Although one study found that 36 of 240 women with operable breast cancer reported having breast pain, only 16 presented with mastalgia alone.

2 Even in these women, it was not clear whether the cancer caused the breast pain or the symptom of pain resulted in a breast evaluation that identified an asymptomatic cancer. The etiology of breast pain is unknown. Its relationship to the menstrual cycle and its more frequent occurrence in pre-menopausal women suggest a hormonal etiology, but no reproducible alterations in estrogen, progesterone or prolactin levels have been identified in women with mastalgia. Premenstrual water retention in the breasts has also been proposed as a cause of mastalgia and is the rationale for the use of diuretics in the treatment of this condition. However, one study found no correlation between total body water and breast pain in 39 women with breast pain and 17 control subjects. 3 No histologic findings correlate with breast pain.

Although "fibrocystic disease" is often present in the biopsy specimens of women with breast pain, studies have shown that fibrocystic changes are also present in the breasts of 50 to 90 percent of asymptomatic women. Hence, the presence of these changes is not proof of a causal relationship. The evaluation of breast pain begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Special attention should be given to the type of pain, its location and its relationship to the menstrual cycle. Most commonly, breast pain is associated with the menstrual cycle and is most severe before the menses. However, breast pain can also be unrelated to the menstrual cycle or can occur post-menopausally. Cyclic pain is usually bilateral and poorly localized. It is generally described as a heaviness or soreness that often radiates to the axilla and arm. The pain has a variable duration and is often relieved after the menses.

Compared with noncyclic mastalgia, cyclic breast pain occurs more often in younger women. Most cyclic pain resolves spontaneously. Noncyclic mastalgia is most common in women 40 to 50 years of age. It is often unilateral and is described as a sharp, burning pain that appears to be localized in the breast. Noncyclic mastalgia is occasionally secondary to the presence of a fibroadenoma or cyst, and the pain may be relieved by treatment of the underlying breast lesion. Menstrual irregularity, emotional stress and medication changes have been shown to exacerbate mastalgia. In obtaining the history, questions should be directed at identifying problems in these areas. A thorough breast examination should be performed to exclude the presence of a breast mass. In the absence of a mass, women 35 years of age and older should undergo mammography unless a mammogram was obtained in the past 10 to 12 months.

Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to decrease the mortality rate (1). Technology continues to evolve to improve the accuracy of detection. In addition, the process of individual risk assessment is evolving, and new factors that affect risk are being identified. The purpose of this document is to clarify the rationale for current breast cancer screening guidelines and evaluate the evidence regarding screening techniques. It also focuses on mammography and other detection techniques as screening tools to identify nonpalpable lesions; the use of mammography for diagnostic purposes when a lesion is palpated is addressed briefly.

### Imaging and management of nonpalpable lesions of the breast [^1137icrC]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Mammography remains the primary imaging modality for the evaluation of breast disease. Its performance level is clearly related to strict quality control measures and comprehensive diagnostic imaging. Ultrasonography remains an adjunct tool for analysing nonpalpable and palpable masses; diagnostic criteria for benign lesions must be strictly applied. Reliable histologic diagnosis is possible with percutaneous large needle core biopsies; benign findings should always be correlated with imaging data and follow-up is essential to detect delayed false negatives. MR imaging is still under evaluation for most indications. Its high sensitivity and negative predictive value are of particular interest for the detection or elimination of breast cancer in selected populations.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^114NjZwr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Breast-related symptoms are among the most common reasons women present to obstetrician-gynecologists. Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a favorable position to diagnose benign breast disease in their patients. The purpose of a thorough understanding of benign breast disease is threefold: 1) to alleviate, when possible, symptoms attributable to benign breast disease, 2) to distinguish benign from malignant breast disease, and 3) to identify patients with an increased risk of breast cancer so that increased surveillance or preventive therapy can be initiated. Obstetrician-gynecologists may perform diagnostic procedures when indicated or may make referrals to physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of breast disease. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to outline common benign breast disease symptoms in women who are not pregnant or lactating and discuss appropriate evaluation and management. The obstetrician-gynecologist's role in the screening and management of breast cancer is beyond the scope of this document and is addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ().

### Interpreting BI-RADS-free breast MRI reports using a large language model: automated BI-RADS classification from narrative reports using chatGPT [^115mKPhm]. Academic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-4o) in interpreting free-text breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports by assigning BI-RADS categories and recommending appropriate clinical management steps in the absence of explicitly stated BI-RADS classifications.

Methods

In this retrospective, single-center study, a total of 352 documented full-text breast MRI reports of at least one identifiable breast lesion with descriptive imaging findings between January 2024 and June 2025 were included in the study. Incomplete reports due to technical limitations, reports describing only normal findings, and MRI examinations performed at external institutions were excluded from the study. First, it was aimed to assess ChatGPT's ability to infer the correct BI-RADS category (2–3–4a-4b-4c-5 separately) based solely on the narrative imaging findings. Second, it was evaluated the model's ability to distinguish between benign versus suspicious/malignant imaging features in terms of clinical decision-making. Therefore, BI-RADS 2–3 categories were grouped as "benign", and BI-RADS 4–5 as "suspicious/malignant", in alignment with how BI-RADS categories are used to guide patient management, rather than to represent definitive diagnostic outcomes. Reports originally containing the term "BI-RADS" were manually de-identified by removing BI-RADS categories and clinical recommendations. Each narrative report was then processed through ChatGPT using two standardized prompts as follows: (1) What is the most appropriate BI-RADS category based on the findings in the report? (2) What should be the next clinical step (e.g., follow-up, biopsy)? Responses were evaluated in real time by two experienced breast radiologists, and consensus was used as the reference standard.

Results

ChatGPT demonstrated moderate agreement with radiologists' consensus for BI-RADS classification (Cohen's Kappa (κ): 0.510, p < 0.001). Classification accuracy was highest for BI-RADS 5 reports (77.9%), whereas lower agreement was observed in intermediate categories such as BI-RADS 3 (52.4% correct) and 4B (29.4% correct). In the binary classification of reports as benign or malignant, ChatGPT achieved almost perfect agreement (κ: 0.843), correctly identifying 91.7% of benign and 93.2% of malignant reports. Notably, the model's management recommendations were 100% consistent with its assigned BI-RADS categories, advising biopsy for all BI-RADS 4–5 cases and short-interval follow-up or conditional biopsy for BI-RADS 3 reports.

Conclusion

ChatGPT accurately interprets unstructured breast MRI reports, particularly in benign/malignant discrimination and corresponding clinical recommendations. This technology holds potential as a decision support tool to standardize reporting and enhance clinical workflows, especially in settings with variable reporting practices. Prospective, multi-institutional studies are needed for further validation.

### Cystic breast lesions: diagnostic approach and US assessment [^116SYYuA]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Various cystic breast lesions are encountered during screening and diagnostic breast imaging. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from the American College of Radiology, cystic breast lesions can be classified into the following categories based on sonographic findings: simple cysts, complicated cysts, clustered microcysts, and complex cystic and solid masses. With appropriate technique, simple cysts can be diagnosed easily by satisfying the diagnostic criteria, which include anechoic round or oval lesions with circumscribed margins and posterior enhancement on US images. Simple cysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 2, benign. Complicated cysts contain debris and satisfy all other sonographic criteria for simple cysts, except they are not anechoic. Clustered microcysts are defined as lesions comprising a cluster of small anechoic masses without a solid component. Based on recent investigations, complicated cysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 3, probably benign, whereas clustered microcysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 2. Complex cystic and solid masses contain fluid and solid components and include those with a thick wall, thick septations, an intracystic or mural mass, and both cystic and solid components. They usually are considered BI-RADS category 4, suspicious, and are accompanied by a biopsy recommendation. Radiologists must evaluate cystic lesions carefully, with meticulous technique, and provide appropriate assessment and management recommendations, thereby reducing unnecessary follow-up and biopsies while preventing cancers from being missed or dismissed. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Suspicious presentation of pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. A 56-year-old woman with a new focal asymmetry in the outer breast that was identified on her (a) screening mammogram and persisted on (b) additional diagnostic spot compression views (arrows). The area was palpable by the patient and the clinician. The focal asymmetry had developed since her prior available mammogram performed 4 years earlier (c). Breast ultrasound (d) shows a corresponding irregular hypoechoic mass with associated posterior acoustic shadowing (arrow). Breast MRI sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted delayed images (e) and axial post-contrast T1-weighted images (f) show irregular enhancing masses (arrows). Corresponding T2 hyperintense cystic components with slit-like spaces (arrow) are identified (g), which favors PASH when present. Ultrasound-guided and MRI-guided biopsies were performed in this case and showed PASH. The area remained mammographically stable for over 4 years

Although it can coexist with malignant lesions, PASH itself is a benign entity without an increased risk for malignancy. To date, only a single case of PASH with malignant transformation has been reported. In cases where PASH is identified as an incidental finding on pathology, no additional intervention is necessary, and clinical and imaging follow-up is recommended. When PASH is identified as a mass on imaging or is the targeted lesion on biopsy, then surgical excision can be considered for larger lesions (> 2 cm) and for women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer or strong family history. In the presence of an enlarging mass, surgical excision is recommended. Recurrence after excision of PASH has been reported at rates from 5 to 22%.

### Breast lesions incidentally detected with CT: what the general radiologist needs to know [^115BjsFL]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Although breast abnormalities are frequently overlooked at multidetector computed tomography (CT) or inaccurately assessed, multidetector CT can reveal sufficient detail in many cases to allow confident diagnosis. It is important for general radiologists to characterize breast lesions incidentally found at CT as benign, indeterminate, or sufficiently suspicious to warrant further work-up. Irregular margins, irregular shape, and rim enhancement are the features most predictive of malignancy. Postoperative changes in the breast may mimic a malignancy; therefore, it is important to obtain an accurate history as to the timing of biopsy or surgery and to follow the changes in lesion morphology over time. Any mass with benign features at CT requires additional validation of benignity with demonstration of long-term stability or additional diagnostic mammographic work-up with or without sonographic evaluation. Accurate description and classification of breast lesions detected with CT enhance the value of the radiologist's report and contribute to appropriate case management.

### Comparison of two protocols for the management of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with adnexal tumours-a randomised controlled trial of RMI / RCOG vs simple rules [^113YYQwE]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Women with all of the following features were classified as low risk of cancer and were offered conservative management: simple, regular, unilateral, unilocular cysts < 5 cm, a CA125 < 30 U mL -1 and an RMI < 25. A simple cyst was defined as a unilocular, anechoic, regular (smooth walls) cyst. Those with a RMI of 25–250 were considered to be at intermediate risk and were offered surgical removal by gynaecologists. Those with a RMI < 25 but with a cyst which is not simple, unilateral, unilocular and < 5 cm were also considered of indeterminate risk. Women with an RMI > 250 were referred for surgery to the tertiary cancer centre as they were considered high risk (Figure 1).

The second trial arm used SRMP. Women in this arm had an ultrasound scan assessment according to the Simple Rules Protocol. The 'SR' uses 10 features to assess adnexal masses. There are five features that predict malignancy (M-features): (1) irregular solid tumour; (2) ascites; (3) at least four papillary structures; (4) irregular multilocular-solid tumour with a largest diameter of at least 100 mm; and (5) very-high-colour content on colour Doppler examination (score 4). There are five features to predict benignity (B-features): (1) unilocular cyst; (2) presence of solid components where the largest solid component has a largest diameter of < 7 mm; (3) acoustic shadows; (4) smooth multilocular tumour < 100 mm in largest diameter; and (5) no detectable blood flow on Doppler examination (score 1). If one or more M-features apply in the absence of a B-feature, the mass is classified as malignant. If one or more B-features apply in the absence of an M-feature, the mass is classified as benign. If no features apply or both M- and B-features apply, the mass cannot be classified and is considered indeterminate. In the SRMP the indeterminate tumours were classified to be of intermediate risk.

### Well-documented benign sonographic characteristics are rarely seen in malignant masses: is now the time to biopsy less? [^11547mrK]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine whether malignant breast masses demonstrate any of the eight well-documented benign criteria on ultrasound (US) to ascertain whether patients that display these characteristics can safely be discharged without intervention reducing the number of unnecessary benign biopsies.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective evaluation was performed of the US images of 816 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases diagnosed from 2016–2018. The malignant lesions were subdivided into seven age categories and compliance with the eight benign (Stavros) characteristics assessed.

Results

None of the 816 malignancies displayed all eight of the described benign Stavros characteristics. The combination of a smooth/well-circumscribed border and an ellipsoid shape with horizontal orientation in addition to being homogeneously isoechoic with three or less gentle lobulations was found in only 0.4% of cases (3/816).

Conclusions

This research adds to the body of literature supporting the robust nature of the Stavros criteria and supports the non-invasive management of lesions that display all of these associated benign features on US. The presence of established benign ultrasound characteristics are very uncommonly seen in malignancies as highlighted in this study, and it is proposed than no breast cancers will display all eight criteria combined. It is suggested that adherence to the well-documented benign characteristics when assessing solid breast lesions could safely obviate the need for biopsy in women of all ages.

### Management of pediatric breast masses for the pediatric surgeon: expert consensus recommendations from the APSA cancer committee [^112CNU1X]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The pathology and management of breast masses in pediatric patients is markedly different than in adults. The vast majority of lesions in children and adolescents are benign, but the rare malignant breast masses require prompt recognition and treatment. Pediatric surgeons navigating clinical evaluation of these masses must balance preservation of the developing breast with appropriate diagnosis and surgical management.

Methods

The current English language literature was queried for pediatric and adolescent breast masses. Identified manuscripts were reviewed and classified by level of evidence. Based on these results, as well as expert consensus, an algorithm regarding clinical workup and management was established.

Results

Evaluation of pediatric breast masses begins with a thorough history and physical exam. Palpable masses should then be further characterized using an ultrasound-guided algorithm. In select cases, observation without surgical resection is appropriate. Surgical management of presumed benign lesions, when performed, should prioritize conserving developing breast tissue and the nipple areolar complex. Excisional biopsy is preferable to core needle biopsy when technically feasible. Surgical management of malignant lesions varies depending on the type of malignancy.

Conclusion

Pediatric surgeons are often the first point of contact after identification of a breast mass in a pediatric or adolescent patient, and therefore play a critical role in management. Based on literature review and expert consensus, we propose an algorithm to guide pediatric surgeons in the diagnosis and treatment of these predominantly benign lesions. For the rare malignant lesions, a multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize patient care.

Benign breast conditions guidelines scope and development — These guidelines are intended for use by general and subspecialist surgeons, radiologists, advanced practice practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists, primary care professionals (internal medicine/family practice), and trainees. The guideline scope is limited to management of the benign condition at time of diagnosis, not the diagnostic process preceding the diagnosis of the condition, and concordance is assumed when biopsy pathology explains imaging results; age-appropriate screening refers to consideration of age and other breast cancer risk factors. A modified Delphi consensus methodology was used, with a consensus panel including ASBrS (n = 12), the Society of Breast Imaging (n = 2), a breast pathology representative (n = 1), and a patient advocate (n = 1), and recommendations were developed by conducting 2 rounds of consensus panel ratings with a priori scoring methods; draft statements underwent public comment and were revised accordingly.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable breast masses: 2022 update [^115JBhqQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for nonmetastatic breast cancer (updated January 2001) [^1152zwrm]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Management of impalpable tumours

The therapeutic strategy for ductal carcinomas in situ is not covered in this document. The therapeutic management of impalpable tumours is often a stepwise process guided by the histological results of the previous intervention. The patient should be informed right from the start about the risks associated with repeated interventions.
First decisional step (Figure 3): This first step is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic and consists of a radiologically proven complete excision and histological analysis of the lesion (standard). In the absence of a palpable macroscopic lesion, a frozen section and primary axillary dissection should not be performed (recommendation, expert agreement). If microcalcifications are present, a mammogram should be performed 2 months after surgery (recommendation, expert agreement).
Second decisional step: This step depends on the status of the surgical margins and the extent of the microcalcification before and/or after surgery. ○ Microinvasive cancer (infiltrating component ≤ 2 mm): There is no specific data concerning the risk of progression of microinvasive cancers. The recommendations are the same as those proposed for invasive cancers (Figure 4). – Extensive microcalcifications at diagnosis (breast-conserving surgery inappropriate): Modified radical mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction should be offered (standard). – Clear margins and no residual microcalcifications: The breast should be irradiated (standard). Modified radical mastectomy can be considered if the patient refuses conservative treatment (option). Axillary dissection or axillary radiotherapy may also be performed (option). In the absence of known risk factors for metastatic recurrence, adjuvant systemic treatment should not be given (recommendation, level of evidence: B). – Involved margins and/or residual microcalcifications: Mastectomy is the standard treatment (standard). Re-excision and breast radiotherapy, or axillary dissection and radiotherapy can be performed (option). If re-excision does not provide clear margins, mastectomy should be performed (standard). ○ Invasive cancer (Figure 5): – Extensive micro-calcifications at diagnosis: Modified radical mastectomy is indicated (standard). In the event of lymph node invasion, radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) should be performed (standard). – Clear margins and/or absence of residual microcalcifications: The standard procedure is axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy (standard). If the patient presents with lymph node involvement, this should be followed by lymph node irradiation (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) (standard). It is also possible to irradiate the lymph nodes without axillary surgery (option). – Invaded margins and/or presence of residual microcalcifications: Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). In the event of lymph node involvement, this should be followed by the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) irradiation (standard). Re-excision combined with axillary dissection, followed by breast radiotherapy can be undertaken. Breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can also be considered (option).

Lactation-specific masses — imaging deferral versus indication — advises that when history and examination by an experienced breastfeeding medicine physician are consistent with a lactation-related condition that the provider is comfortable managing, imaging can be deferred; if the condition presents atypically or does not resolve with standard treatment, diagnostic imaging is indicated. Examples include accessory breast tissue, which occurs in 2–6% of women with bilaterality in about one-third of cases, and plugged ducts, which occur in areas of milk stasis localized to a specific quadrant; if engorgement of accessory tissue does not resolve after several weeks postpartum, diagnostic imaging is indicated to rule out an alternative diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^114st56g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Mimickers of breast malignancy: imaging findings, pathologic concordance and clinical management [^112us6NA]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Many benign breast entities have a clinical and imaging presentation that can mimic breast cancer. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the wide spectrum of imaging features that can be associated with benign breast diseases with an emphasis on the suspicious imaging findings associated with these benign conditions that can mimic cancer. As radiologic-pathologic correlation can be particularly challenging in these cases, the radiologist's familiarity with these benign entities and their imaging features is essential to ensure that a benign pathology result is accepted as concordant when appropriate and that a suitable management plan is formulated.

Benign breast fibroepithelial lesions — conclusions and excision criteria: Biopsy-proven and radiologically concordant fibroadenomas without intrinsic or adjacent atypia do not require routine excision. Clinicians should excise fibroadenomas if discordant with imaging, based on patient preference or symptoms, or if there is any concern for a PT, such as size larger than 4 to 6 cm, or with substantive growth over time. Lesions called an FEL on core biopsy with histologic or clinical suspicion for a PT should undergo surgical excision, without transection of the lesion, but do not require a negative surgical margin.

### Cystic breast masses and the ACRIN 6666 experience [^111efgS8]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Masses due to cystic lesions of the breast are extremely common findings on mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Although many of these lesions can be dismissed as benign simple cysts, requiring intervention only for symptomatic relief, complex cystic and solid masses require biopsy. Perhaps, the most challenging are complicated cysts, that is, cysts with internal debris. When the debris is mobile or a fluid-debris level is seen, complicated cysts can be dismissed as benign findings. As an isolated finding, homogeneous complicated cysts can be classified as probably benign, with intervention only considered with interval development or enlargement, abscess is suspected, or if suspicious features develop. When multiple and bilateral complicated and simple cysts are present (ie, at least three, with at least one in each breast), a benign, BI-RADS 2, assessment is usually appropriate. Clustered microcysts are common benign findings in pre- and perimenopausal women, though short-interval surveillance may be appropriate for many such lesions in post-menopausal women, particularly if the lesion is new or rather small or deep (ie, diagnostic uncertainty).

### Benign-appearing incidental adnexal cysts at US, CT, and MRI: putting the ACR, O-RADS, and SRU guidelines all together [^113Y1ddn]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Adnexal cysts are a common incidental finding at US, CT, and MRI but have historically caused a diagnostic dilemma for determining when to follow up and how to manage them. Characteristic imaging features of simple adnexal cysts include a simple fluid collection with smooth walls and no solid or vascular components. Day-to-day practice guidelines were recently updated to reflect the overwhelming evidence that incidental cystic adnexal masses are almost always benign. Three major consensus articles on adnexal cystic masses were published between 2019 and 2020: the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) consensus update on adnexal cysts, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US consensus guideline, and the American College of Radiology (ACR) white paper on the management for incidental adnexal findings at CT and MRI. All three standardize reporting terminology, are based on evidence-based data and institutional practice patterns, and apply to nonpregnant women of average risk for ovarian cancer. While there are small differences in follow-up recommendations based on size thresholds, the goal of each is the same-to limit unnecessary imaging follow-up and, by doing so, save the patient time, money, and anxiety. For the diagnostic radiologist to use these guidelines, it is essential that the entire mass is visualized well. Without adequate visualization, further characterization of the mass may be necessary. To put it all together, the SRU consensus guideline and ACR white paper are easily applied in day-to-day practice for masses that are O-RADS 2 and below.

### A young woman with bilateral breast cancer: identifying a genetic cause and implications for management [^116DMaRN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is a common manifestation of an underlying genetic susceptibility to cancer, and 5% to 10% of all breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in a known risk allele. Detection of mutations has implications for targeted screening and prevention strategies for probands, and for genetic counseling and testing of their family members. This report presents a case involving a 35-year-old woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer who presented with a palpable right breast lump. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral breast masses and right axillary adenopathy, and core needle biopsies showed invasive ductal carcinoma in both the right and left breast. This report discusses the appropriate genetics evaluation for a patient with bilateral breast cancer at a young age, including testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, followed, if negative, by consideration of testing for mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Given the specialized counseling and testing needs of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the implications for targeted screening strategies if a mutation is found, referral to a cancer genetics expert is strongly recommended.

### Evaluation of palpable breast masses [^114eGvcP]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpable breast masses are common and usually benign, but efficient evaluation and prompt diagnosis are necessary to rule out malignancy. A thorough clinical breast examination, imaging, and tissue sampling are needed for a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and it can differentiate solid and cystic masses. However, physicians must have adequate training to perform this procedure. Mammography screens for occult malignancy in the same and contralateral breast and can detect malignant lesions in older women; it is less sensitive in women younger than 40 years. Ultrasonography can detect cystic masses, which are common, and may be used to guide biopsy techniques. Tissue specimens obtained with core-needle biopsy allow histologic diagnosis, hormone-receptor testing, and differentiation between in situ and invasive disease. Core-needle biopsy is more invasive than fine-needle aspiration, requires more training and experience, and frequently requires imaging guidance. After the clinical breast examination is performed, the evaluation depends largely on the patient's age and examination characteristics, and the physician's experience in performing fine-needle aspiration.

### American Society of Breast Surgeons and society of breast imaging 2025 guidelines for the management of benign breast fibroepithelial lesions [^114qRkyD]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Benign breast fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) — management consensus directives for fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors are as follows: There was strong consensus that core biopsy-proven concordant fibroadenomas without atypia only require excision if they were symptomatic, patient preferred, attained a certain size, or demonstrated substantive growth over time on clinical examination, and there was strong consensus that when removing a fibroadenoma, complete excision without transection of the mass is recommended and surgeons should consider aesthetics, sensation, and other factors when selecting incision placement; patients with core biopsy-proven concordant fibroadenomas do not require imaging follow-up and may return to age-appropriate screening. Many benign phyllodes tumors (BPTs) present as an FEL on core biopsy, and these lesions along with any lesions with suspicion of or concern for phyllodes tumors (PTs) require surgical excisional biopsy with complete excision of the mass; re-excision of a BPT is not required for patients with a positive margin for BPT, but a margin re-excision may be considered if the mass was transected or there is concern of residual disease after excisional biopsy, and patients with BPT who have undergone excision do not require follow-up imaging and may return to age-appropriate screening.

Management of a single, palpable, Localised tumour treatable by breast-conserving surgery

A single palpable localised tumour can be completely excised with a wide margin (Figure 6

Impalpable operable tumour–locoregional treatment.

Figure 4
Operable impalpable tumour–locoregional treatment.

Figure 5
Operable impalpable tumour–locoregional treatment.

Figure 6

First decision step (Figure 7 Figure 7 Operable palpable tumour–locoregional treatment.): Lumpectomy (± frozen section), axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy is the standard. The breast should always be irradiated; this has been shown to reduce considerably the rate of local recurrence (recommendation, level of evidence. A). Axillary dissection should only be undertaken after the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma has been confirmed (recommendation, expert agreement). It is essential to examine all tissue margins (recommendation). Central tumours can be managed with conservative treatment (recommendation, expert agreement). If the patient refuses conservative treatment, a modified radical mastectomy can be considered (option). If microcalcifications are present, a postoperative mammogram is essential to verify the presence or absence of residual lesions after conservative treatment (standard, expert agreement).
Second decision step (Figure 8 Figure 8 Operable palpable tumour–locoregional treatment.): This step follows conservative treatment and depends on the histological status of the tissue margins and the presence of other risk factors. ○ Clear excision margins (Figure 8): Whole breast radiotherapy should be performed (standard) with an additional dose to the tumour bed (boost) if the patient is under 50 years old (standard). This association can be given to patients over 50 years old who have other risk factors for recurrence (option). ○ Positive excision margins (Figure 9 Figure 9 Operable palpable tumour–locoregional treatment.) – When re-excision is possible (histologically clear margins possible and a satisfactory aesthetic result). The standard procedure is to undertake re-excision and breast radiotherapy (standard). This should be followed by a boost to the tumour bed if the patient is under 50 years old (standard) or has other risk factors (option). If a boost to the tumour bed and/or re-excision is performed, the aesthetic result should be satisfactory (recommendation, expert agreement). If the patient refuses re-excision, breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can be considered (option). Modified radical mastectomy can also be considered (option). – When re-excision is impossible (the margins will be involved after re-excision, and/or the aesthetic result will not be satisfactory). Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). Immediate breast reconstruction can be considered if there are no other risk factors for locoregional recurrence and/or this does not prejudice the administration of additional treatment (option).

Fibroadenoma post-biopsy follow-up — biopsy-proven fibroadenomas with benign features can return to routine screening, with most remaining stable; return for surgical discussion if there is significant growth or if size reaches 4 to 6 cm. These patients can return to age-appropriate breast screening, and a retrospective series reported approximately 80% stability over a mean 31 months with only a single benign phyllodes tumor (BPT) found among enlarging lesions; multiple bilateral circumscribed masses with benign imaging features do not require additional follow-up beyond age-appropriate screening.

Management algorithm for benign phyllodes tumors — when a core needle biopsy pathology report indicates fibroepithelial lesions and/or concern for or suspicion of phyllodes tumors, assess for clinical features suggestive of phyllodes tumor. If not suggestive: proceed to surgical excisional biopsy (complete excision) with complete excision without transection or morcellation of the mass and consideration of aesthetics, implications on future breastfeeding, and nipple/skin sensation when selecting incision placement. If suggestive: perform surgical excisional biopsy and may consider an attempt at a narrow negative margin. Pathology-directed actions include: fibroadenoma — return to age-appropriate screening; benign phyllodes — no radiographic staging studies needed, no radiation therapy for any reason, and negative surgical margin not required as long as the mass is not transected or morcellated, then review NCCN guidelines; borderline or malignant phyllodes — treat per NCCN guidelines; other malignancy — treat per NCCN guidelines. Clinical features listed are large size at presentation (4–6 cm), rapid growth, and numerous mitoses on core stromal expansion, and expedited progression to the operating room should be pursued with elevated concern for malignant phyllodes or sarcoma without delays for plastic surgery or immediate reconstruction. Local recurrence risk for a benign phyllodes tumor remains low even in the presence of a positive margin.

Diagnostic assessment

In patients with symptoms or signs suspicious for breast cancer, which typically comprise palpable lumps (but also, nipple inversion, localised skin retraction or other modifications, serous or bloody nipple discharge), US is an established tool complementing clinical examination and mammography at all ages. It is the method of choice for assessing breast lumps in young women. US can also reveal the origin of the symptoms in patients with painful cysts. When patients present with unilateral, localised, non-cyclic breast pain, the chance of malignancy is as low as 1%. In pregnant or lactating women with a palpable lump, focal breast pain, or nipple discharge, US is also the initial modality of choice for identifying most benign and malignant masses. However, when needed, using adequate shielding, mammography can be supplemented even during pregnancy and injury to the unborn baby is not expected beyond week 16.

Patients presenting with diffuse breast pain, usually in association with the premenstrual phase, are often evaluated and treated only on a clinical basis.

Assessment of lesions detected by mammography

Targeted US plays a complementary role when a mass or an asymmetry is seen on a mammogram. It may help in differentiating cystic from solid lesions and excluding or identifying a solid mass underlying an asymmetry. In the presence of clustered calcifications, particularly clusters larger than 10 mm, US can depict associated masses, ductal change, or intracystic lesions, cysts and microcysts that may be crucial for diagnosis.
Note E: Mammography is clearly superior to US in identifying and characterising calcifications. However, in the presence of calcifications on mammography, targeted US is recommended to reveal possible underlying masses.

### Breast cancer screening: the questions answered [^11279tew]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Early detection of cancer has long been thought to be the first step towards eradicating the mortality associated with the disease. National screening programmes for breast cancer have been implemented in many countries. However, there is controversy regarding the efficacy and optimal methods of screening, which is regularly discussed in articles, at conferences and is apparent in conflicting guidelines. In this article, Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology asks four experts their opinions on some of the pressing questions associated with breast cancer screening.

### Imaging management of palpable breast abnormalities [^1139EuZJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Women commonly present to imaging departments with a palpable breast abnormality. However, widespread confusion remains regarding the most appropriate sequence and extent of imaging required. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evidence informing current management guidelines for the care of patients with palpable breast abnormalities.

Conclusion

Ultrasound is a highly effective imaging tool for guiding effective evaluation of women with palpable breast abnormalities and should be used for all women with suspicious findings at clinical breast examination. The exception is cases in which mammography shows a clearly benign correlate or a normal, fatty area of breast tissue in the location of the palpable finding. Breast ultrasound should be the primary imaging tool for women with palpable lumps who are pregnant, lactating, or younger than 30 years. For women 40 years old and older, mammography, followed in most cases by ultrasound, is recommended. For women 30–39 years old, ultrasound or mammography may be performed first at the discretion of the radiologist or referring provider. There is little to no role for breast MRI or other advanced imaging technologies in the routine diagnostic evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome — breast cancer risk and surveillance include that invasive ductal adenocarcinoma poses a "24%–54% lifetime risk in women" and often presents "at a young age (range, 19–61 years in 1 study)", with risk "within the same range as women affected by BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 pathogenic variants (40%–85% lifetime risk for breast cancer)". Consensus surveillance recommendations "include monthly breast self-examination starting at age 18 years, biannual clinical breast examination starting at age 25 years, annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from ages 25–29 years, and mammography with consideration of tomosynthesis (3-dimensional mammography) alternating every 6 months with breast MRI with contrast from ages 30 to 75 years". It further states that "A multidisciplinary approach including a breast surgeon is recommended when prophylactic mastectomy is being considered".

Test performance

Performance refers to the general ability of a test, here breast US, to make a correct diagnosis, i.e. to see cancers when they are present (sensitivity) or to exclude them when they are not (specificity).

No test is perfect. This is also true for breast US. Its sensitivity and specificity also depend on the specific setting (i.e. the indication) in which it is applied, particularly in the major distinction between its application in symptomatic women (diagnostic performance) or in asymptomatic women (screening performance).

Considering the high operator-dependence, and the fact that most US studies are performed together with, and complementary to, other examinations (clinical examination and mammography), it is difficult to define precisely a sensitivity for US alone. It varies strongly depending on lesion size, type of breast tissue and (as for all methods) on patient selection.

When a woman has focal symptoms, typically a palpable lump, US is performed as a targeted examination and has a high sensitivity. In this clinical setting, US is useful for differentiating liquid benign lesions (cysts) from solid masses, characterising solid masses, and deciding whether a US-guided needle biopsy should be performed. Since the negative predictive value (NPV) of breast US, i.e. the probability that a negative examination is truly negative (no cancers are present) is usually not perfect (like that of mammography), exclusion of malignancy can require a combined evaluation of ultrasound with mammography and clinical findings. Based on US, it is possible to exclude malignancy in case of pathognomonic findings like simple cysts or when a low suspicion finding (like some mammographic asymmetry) correlates at US with homogeneously hyperechoic normal gland tissue or with a mobile and elastic well-circumscribed oval mass compatible with a fibroadenoma. The addition of mammography to US should be considered whenever the pre-test probability of malignancy is high enough, usually in women over 40 or in women with somewhat atypical US findings.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^114q6oah]. RCOG (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ovarian cysts, more specifically with respect to postmenopausal patients (surveillance imaging), RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend to recognize that asymptomatic, simple, unilateral, unilocular, < 5 cm ovarian cysts have a low risk of malignancy. Obtain repeat evaluation in 4–6 months in patients with normal serum CA-125 levels. Consider discontinuing surveillance after 1 year if the cyst remains unchanged or reduces in size, with normal CA-125, taking into consideration the patient's wishes and surgical fitness.
