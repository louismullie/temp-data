## Question

Iron requirements for infant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about iron requirements for infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the age-stratified physiologic requirements and how they differ by feeding modality. Then, I should verify the evidence base for supplementation in exclusively breastfed versus formula-fed infants. Next, I will examine special populations such as preterm and low-birth-weight infants. After that, I need to review screening recommendations and practical dosing. Finally, I will consider safety, absorption enhancers and inhibitors, and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the core physiologic framework. Healthy term infants generally have sufficient iron stores from late gestation to meet needs for about the first 4–6 months of life, after which exogenous iron becomes essential due to rapid growth and expanding blood volume. This is the foundation for distinguishing 0–6 months from 6–12 months guidance and for tailoring recommendations to feeding type and risk status [^a60ea2a4] [^39dcd0bc] [^2a2e235b].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative requirements by age. For infants 6–12 months, the estimated average requirement is about 6.9–8.0 mg/day and the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 11 mg/day, assuming roughly 10% absorption. For 1–3 years, the estimated average requirement is 3–5 mg/day with an RDA of 7 mg/day. These figures anchor counseling on complementary feeding and supplementation when intake is inadequate [^2a2e235b] [^953b40f8].

> I will now examine exclusively breastfed term infants. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite high bioavailability of iron in human milk (~50%), the concentration is low (~0.35 mg/L), so total intake is insufficient after about 4–6 months. The AAP recommends 1 mg/kg/day of elemental iron starting at 4 months and continuing until iron-containing complementary foods are introduced, with ABM noting improved hematologic indices but uncertain long-term benefit and potential harms if given to iron-replete infants, so shared decision-making is prudent [^b8ccc387] [^cdb77a19] [^2f80960b] [^987ef403].

> Let me consider formula-fed infants. I should confirm that standard infant formulas are iron-fortified to 4–8 mg/L, which typically meets needs through 12 months without additional supplementation, assuming timely introduction of iron-containing solids around 6 months. This is supported by AAP and European guidance and aligns with the physiologic transition at 6 months when endogenous stores are depleted [^015d503a] [^953b40f8] [^2a2e235b].

> Next, I should review preterm and low-birth-weight infants. Prematurity truncates third-trimester iron accretion, so these infants deplete stores by 6–8 weeks and require higher doses. WHO recommends initiating enteral iron at 2–4 mg/kg/day in human milk–fed preterm/LBW infants, and AAP suggests at least 2 mg/kg/day through 12 months. Some expert groups cite 5–6 mg/kg/day for preterm infants, reflecting higher needs during catch-up growth, so I need to ensure dosing is individualized to gestational age, growth trajectory, and transfusion history [^0741949c] [^acef53e0] [^5c0576d6] [^fbde1e74].

> Hold on, I should verify screening recommendations. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend universal screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children 6–24 months, yet CDC and AAP advise selective screening at 9–12 months, with earlier screening for preterm infants or those not receiving iron-fortified formula. Given the high prevalence of inadequate intake in 6–12 month olds, especially breastfed infants, many clinicians adopt a pragmatic screening approach in high-risk groups [^347f2570] [^e2a74ff3] [^67952f4c] [^d48706be].

> I need to check practical dosing and formulations. For prevention in breastfed term infants, 1 mg/kg/day elemental iron as drops is standard. For treatment of confirmed iron deficiency anemia, 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 1–3 divided doses for 3–6 months is recommended, with ferrous sulfate preferred over iron polysaccharide complex for better efficacy. Absorption is enhanced with vitamin C and impaired by calcium, phytate, and polyphenols, so timing and co-ingestion matter [^40982441] [^778ecaed] [^f56b2ee0] [^5c7cbf60].

> But wait, what about safety and the risk of excess iron. Emerging data suggest that routine iron supplementation of iron-replete infants may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in some contexts, and iron is pro-oxidant, so the principle is to use the lowest effective dose to prevent deficiency. This is particularly salient in developed settings where baseline IDA prevalence is low and fortification is widespread, reinforcing caution with blanket supplementation beyond high-risk groups [^a97aa92a] [^4df32cd0].

> Let me reconsider complementary feeding strategies that meaningfully close the iron gap. Heme iron from meat and fortified infant cereals are the most reliable sources; adding vitamin C enhances absorption, while delaying cow's milk to 12 months and limiting intake to < 500 mL/day reduces inhibition of iron absorption and gastrointestinal blood loss. Systematic reviews indicate that introducing iron-containing complementary foods helps maintain adequate iron status, though benefits are less pronounced in infants with sufficient stores, underscoring the need to tailor advice to baseline risk [^fd71386e] [^f8b35335] [^015d503a] [^2a7b97fd].

> I should double-check real-world intake gaps. Modeling studies show that 54–96% of 6–12 month olds have calculated absorbed iron below physiologic requirements, with exclusively breastfed infants at highest risk; this explains why many clinicians prioritize early introduction of iron-rich solids and consider supplementation when intake remains inadequate, even as we acknowledge that optimal timing of solids remains debated and evidence is mixed for starting before 6 months in developed settings [^d48706be] [^fd71386e] [^82c6f7f4].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For term infants 0–6 months: exclusive breastfeeding is preferred, with 1 mg/kg/day iron for exclusively breastfed infants starting at 4 months if complementary foods are not yet introduced. For 6–12 months: prioritize iron-rich complementary foods and fortified cereals; if intake is inadequate, continue 1 mg/kg/day supplementation. For preterm/LBW infants: start 2–4 mg/kg/day enteral iron by about 2–4 weeks of life and continue through 12 months, adjusting for growth and transfusion exposure. For formula-fed infants: ensure iron-fortified formula and introduce iron-containing solids at ~6 months, with supplementation reserved for documented deficiency or high-risk scenarios [^b8ccc387] [^0741949c] [^953b40f8] [^2a2e235b].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key uncertainties are transparent. Evidence gaps remain regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of early iron supplementation in iron-replete infants, the optimal iron concentration in follow-on formulas, and the best screening cadence in diverse populations. Until stronger data emerge, individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making, with attention to diet quality and adherence, are essential to balance benefit and harm [^4df32cd0] [^015d503a] [^347f2570].

Infants need **0.27 mg/day** of iron from 0–6 months [^notfound], as breast milk or iron-fortified formula suffices [^1e654500]; **11 mg/day** from 6–12 months [^953b40f8] [^2a2e235b], when complementary iron-rich foods or 1 mg/kg/day supplements are required [^b8ccc387] [^2f80960b]; and **7 mg/day** from 1–3 years [^953b40f8], with continued emphasis on iron-rich foods and limited cow's milk [^015d503a]. Preterm or low-birth-weight infants need **2–4 mg/kg/day** [^0741949c] from 2–4 weeks through 12 months [^8b177748]. Iron deficiency is common after 6 months [^d48706be] and can cause irreversible neurodevelopmental harm [^c5adb8a0], so timely introduction of iron sources and screening at 9–12 months are essential [^67952f4c].

## Iron requirements by age

| **Age group** | **Recommended dietary allowance (rda)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–6 months | 0.27 mg/day | - Breast milk or iron-fortified formula suffices [^1e654500] [^39dcd0bc] <br/> - Stores from gestation cover needs [^a60ea2a4] |
| 6–12 months | 11 mg/day | - Complementary iron-rich foods or 1 mg/kg/day supplements required [^b8ccc387] [^2f80960b] <br/> - Stores deplete by 6 months [^2a2e235b] |
| 1–3 years | 7 mg/day | - Emphasize iron-rich foods <br/> - Limit cow's milk to < 500 mL/day [^015d503a] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Preterm or low-birth-weight infants**: 2–4 mg/kg/day from 2–4 weeks through 12 months [^0741949c] [^8b177748].
- **Exclusively breastfed term infants**: 1 mg/kg/day from 4–6 months until iron-rich foods are introduced [^b8ccc387] [^2f80960b].
- **Formula-fed infants**: Use iron-fortified formula (4–8 mg/L) [^015d503a]; no extra iron needed unless deficiency is diagnosed [^9bc69a19].

---

## Consequences of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency globally [^d26ff216] and is especially harmful in infancy [^c5adb8a0]. It can cause **irreversible neurodevelopmental deficits**, including impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes [^c5adb8a0] [^a97aa92a]. It also increases susceptibility to infections and is associated with growth impairment [^c6bbc489].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Screening**: Universal anemia screening at 9–12 months [^67952f4c]; earlier for preterm or low-birth-weight infants [^e2a74ff3].
- **Supplementation**: 1 mg/kg/day for exclusively breastfed infants from 4–6 months until iron-rich foods are introduced [^b8ccc387] [^2f80960b].
- **Complementary feeding**: Introduce iron-rich foods (meat, fortified cereals) at ~6 months [^fd71386e]; continue breastfeeding or formula to 12 months [^015d503a].

---

## Summary of key points

- **0–6 months**: 0.27 mg/day; breast milk or iron-fortified formula suffices [^1e654500] [^39dcd0bc].
- **6–12 months**: 11 mg/day; iron-rich foods or 1 mg/kg/day supplements required [^b8ccc387] [^2f80960b].
- **1–3 years**: 7 mg/day; emphasize iron-rich foods and limit cow's milk [^015d503a].
- **Preterm/low-birth-weight**: 2–4 mg/kg/day from 2–4 weeks through 12 months [^0741949c] [^8b177748].
- **Screening**: At 9–12 months; earlier for high-risk infants [^67952f4c] [^e2a74ff3].

### Iron requirements of infants and toddlers [^015d503a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide and young children are a special risk group because their rapid growth leads to high iron requirements. Risk factors associated with a higher prevalence of ID anemia (IDA) include low birth weight, high cow's-milk intake, low intake of iron-rich complementary foods, low socioeconomic status, and immigrant status. The aim of this position paper was to review the field and provide recommendations regarding iron requirements in infants and toddlers, including those of moderately or marginally low birth weight. There is no evidence that iron supplementation of pregnant women improves iron status in their offspring in a European setting. Delayed cord clamping reduces the risk of ID. There is insufficient evidence to support general iron supplementation of healthy European infants and toddlers of normal birth weight. Formula-fed infants up to 6 months of age should receive iron-fortified infant formula, with an iron content of 4 to 8 mg/L (0.6-1.2 mg(-1) · kg(-1) · day(-1)). Marginally low-birth-weight infants (2000-2500 g) should receive iron supplements of 1-2 mg(-1) · kg(-1) · day(-1). Follow-on formulas should be iron-fortified; however, there is not enough evidence to determine the optimal iron concentration in follow-on formula. From the age of 6 months, all infants and toddlers should receive iron-rich (complementary) foods, including meat products and/or iron-fortified foods. Unmodified cow's milk should not be fed as the main milk drink to infants before the age of 12 months and intake should be limited to <500 mL/day in toddlers. It is important to ensure that this dietary advice reaches high-risk groups such as socioeconomically disadvantaged families and immigrant families.

### Iron and breastfeeding [^b3e6a2f5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Given the importance of iron nutrition during the first year of life, there are surprisingly few true, randomized, controlled studies addressing this issue; however, it seems that iron deficiency is unlikely in full-term, breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life because these infants' body iron stores are sufficient to meet requirements. After this time, many infants exhaust their iron stores and become dependent on a secondary dietary iron supply. Although iron deficiency is a significant nutritional problem worldwide, most of the adverse effects of iron deficiency in this age group are hypothetical and rely on extrapolation from animal studies or studies at different ages. This, however, also is true of most of the adverse effects of iron excess in this age group. Given this uncertainty, it seems prudent to use the lowest dose of iron that prevents iron-deficiency anemia. Currently, the best evidence is that this is achieved by prolonged breastfeeding, avoidance of unfortified formulas and cow's milk, and the introduction of iron-fortified and vitamin C-fortified weaning foods at approximately 6 months of age. Despite much research, there are many areas of uncertainty regarding iron supplementation of infants, including that: 1. The optimal age for introducing iron-fortified supplemental foods is poorly defined and should be further evaluated. 2. The natural history of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia during the first year of life is unclear, as are the possible long-term effects of this, especially on developmental outcome. 3. The biologic variability among infants and among their mothers that allows many infants who do not receive iron-fortified foods to prevent iron deficiency while receiving only human milk throughout the first year of life is intriguing and warrants additional study. 4. The iron requirements of small-for-gestational-age, term infants are unknown. Their iron requirements are likely to be higher than those of average term infants, but whether iron supplements are required is unclear. 5. The optimum amount of dietary iron in the weaning diet needs to be further defined. Similarly, the optimal source and amount of iron in infant formulas given to infants who receive a mixture of human milk and formula is unclear.

### Iron homeostasis in the neonate [^c6bbc489]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The regulation of the availability of micronutrients is particularly critical during periods of rapid growth and differentiation such as the fetal and neonatal stages. Both iron deficiency and excess during the early weeks of life can have severe effects on neurodevelopment that may persist into adulthood and may not be corrected by restoration of normal iron levels. This article provides a succinct overview of our current understanding of the extent to which newborns, particularly premature newborns, are able (or not able) to regulate their iron status according to physiologic need. Postnatal development of factors important to iron homeostasis such as intestinal transport, extracellular transport, cellular uptake and storage, intracellular regulation, and systemic control are examined. Also reviewed are how factors peculiar to the sick and premature neonate can further adversely influence iron homeostasis and exacerbate iron-induced oxidative stress, predispose the infant to bacterial infections, and, thus, compromise his or her clinical situation further. The article concludes with a discussion of the areas of relative ignorance that require urgent investigation to rectify our lack of understanding of iron homeostasis in what is a critical stage of development.

### Perspective: putting the youngest among us into the nutrition "call for action" for food fortification strategies [^2a2e235b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Challenges in achieving adequate iron intake by infants and young children

Iron stores at birth are generally sufficient to meet the needs of exclusively breastfed infants for ≥6 mo, assuming delayed umbilical cord clamping. After 6 mo, iron from non-breast-milk sources is needed. At 6–12 mo of age, estimated average iron requirements are 6.9–8.0 mg/d and the recommended dietary intake is 11 mg/d, assuming absorption of 10%. At 1–3 y, iron needs are lower than at 6–12 mo: the estimated average iron requirement is 3–5 mg/d and the recommended dietary intake is 7 mg/d. Although iron needs in these age intervals are well understood, estimates of iron absorption from different foods and under various conditions (such as iron deficiency) vary widely. Absorption from plant-based foods, particularly those with high concentrations of phytate, is likely to be <10%.

### Optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding: what is the evidence to support current recommendations? [^b91cdf12]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Before 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that infants be exclusively breastfed for 4-6 mo with the introduction of complementary foods (any fluid or food other than breast milk) thereafter. In 2001, after a systematic review and expert consultation, this advice was changed, and exclusive breastfeeding is now recommended for the first 6 mo of life. The systematic review commissioned by the WHO compared infant and maternal outcomes for exclusive breastfeeding for 3-4 mo versus 6 mo. That review concluded that infants exclusively breastfed for 6 mo experienced less morbidity from gastrointestinal infection and showed no deficits in growth but that large randomized trials are required to rule out small adverse effects on growth and the development of iron deficiency in susceptible infants. Others have raised concerns that the evidence is insufficient to confidently recommend exclusive breastfeeding for 6 mo for infants in developed countries, that breast milk may not meet the full energy requirements of the average infant at 6 mo of age, and that estimates of the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants at risk of specific nutritional deficiencies are not available. Additionally, virtually no data are available to form evidence-based recommendations for the introduction of solids in formula-fed infants. Given increasing evidence that early nutrition and growth have effects on both short- and longer-term health, it is vital that this issue be investigated in high-quality randomized studies. Meanwhile, the consequences of the WHO recommendation should be monitored in different settings to assess compliance and record and act on adverse events. The policy should then be reviewed in the context of new data to formulate evidence-based recommendations.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^b8ccc387]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Infants and young children—iron supplementation: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 1 mg/kg daily iron supplementation for exclusively breastfed full-term infants from age 4 months until infants begin eating iron-containing complementary foods, and also recommend 1 mg/kg/day supplemental iron beginning at age 4 months for infants who receive more than one-half of their daily feedings as human milk and who are not receiving iron-containing complementary foods.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^d6120cc1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects mainly children, predominantly in low-income countries and most often due to iron deficiency (ID). Administration of iron supplements to prevent and treat ID anemia in malaria endemic areas has been controversial for decades; however, recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend universal iron supplementation for children in highly prevalent anemia settings, including those where malaria is endemic. However, infants younger than 6 months of age have been exempted from this recommendation because ID is not considered prevalent at this age and because of assumptions-without evidence-that they are protected from ID through breast milk. To achieve full impact of anemia prevention targeting infants less than 6 months of age who are at highest risk of ID, operational studies that conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of delivering iron supplements to young infants in settings with a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, are needed.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^8e5ac7db]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

A recently published Cochrane review on daily iron supplementation to children concluded that “iron supplementation does not adversely affect children living in malaria-endemic areas” and that “routine iron supplementation should not be withheld from children living in countries where malaria is prevalent and malaria management services are available.”Based on this information, WHO guidelines now recommend universal daily iron supplementation for children from 6 months of age in settings where anemia is highly prevalent for preventing ID and anemia, without having to test for anemia or ID.This change in the recommendations on anemia prevention is a fundamental public health achievement, and its implementation is expected to have a significant impact in reducing ID and its consequences, mainly in settings where it is most needed. Nevertheless, this policy exempts infants less than 6 months of age mainly on the basis that ID is not a major problem in this age group for physiological reasons and under the assumption that young infants are protected from ID through breastfeeding.However, this assumption is based on the observation that during the first months of life, a sufficient quantity of iron is available in the breast milk produced by mothers with adequate iron stores themselves, which is uncommon in many low-income settings.Thus, in these settings, a high proportion of infants are likely to not achieve normal hemoglobin levels after reaching the nadir at 2–3 months of age, when “physiologic anemia of the infant” occurs.

Young infants are protected from ID if the mother had adequate iron stores during pregnancy; the baby was full-term, with normal birthweight; there was delayed umbilical cord clamping; and sufficient iron was provided from exclusive breastfeeding.Unfortunately, it is rare for all of these conditions to be met and, therefore, most infants in malaria-endemic, and in low-income, countries are at risk of ID during their first 6 months of life. Even in high-income settings, where all the aforementioned criteria are more frequently met, it is considered that the accumulated iron during pregnancy and the amount of iron available in breast milk during the first 6 months of life are not enough to meet the needs of infants. For this reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that exclusively breastfed term infants should receive 1 mg/kg/day of iron supplementation starting at 4 months of age and continue until appropriate iron-containing complementary foods have been introduced.Given the higher frequency of factors associated with ID in infants in resource-poor settings, a clear recommendation for preventing anemia with iron supplementation is needed.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^40982441]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to offer iron-rich foods in infants and children with iron deficiency without anemia. Offer oral iron supplementation of 2-6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron given 1-3 times daily for 3-6 months for the treatment of iron deficiency with anemia.

### Neurological effects of iron supplementation in infancy: finding the balance between health and harm in iron-replete infants [^a97aa92a]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Iron mediates many biochemical processes in neural networks that proliferate during brain development. Insufficient iron causes irreversible neurodevelopmental deficits, and most high-income countries recommend that infants older than 4-6 months receive additional iron via food fortification or supplementation to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia. Now that the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia in children has decreased to less than 10% in most developed countries, concerns that the recommended intakes far exceed those required to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia have been raised, and emerging evidence suggests that iron overexposure could be linked to adverse outcomes later in life. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the importance of iron for neurodevelopment, investigate the biochemical markers used to assess iron stores, summarise the disparity in public health policies among high-income countries, and discuss the potential association between iron overexposure and adverse neurological outcomes later in life. We present a case for new studies to establish the optimal amount of iron that both prevents deficiency and reduces the potential risk of long-term negative health outcomes.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7a810c8]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron requirements increase during pregnancy as a result of an expanding red blood cell mass. Without sufficient iron intake, iron reserves are depleted, red blood cell production is impaired and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) can develop. IDA affects up to 36.5% of pregnant women globally, making it the most common nutritional disorder worldwide. IDA poses substantial risks to both maternal health and foetal health and development, increasing the risk of premature birth, postpartum depression, and low infant birth weight, according to a meta-analysis of 117 studies globally. There is also emerging evidence of maternal and foetal harms even before iron deficiency (ID) progresses to IDA. Infants born of iron-deficient mothers are themselves at increased risk of ID, and may develop impaired cognitive, motor, and social–emotional function.

As a preventative measure, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international guidelines advise that all pregnant women, regardless of iron status, receive iron supplementation alongside folic acid. In contrast, guidelines from other countries, including the UK, USA, and Australia, either recommend against or fail to address universal supplementation, highlighting clinical uncertainty with regard to its benefits for pregnant women who do not have anaemia.

Previous reviews have demonstrated significant benefits of iron supplementation, including a 2015 review which found that supplementation reduced maternal anaemia at term by 70% and improved foetal outcomes, such as birth weight. However, this review combined both anaemic and non-anaemic groups in their analysis. The benefits of iron supplementation are already well established for anaemic women, but the extent to which these benefits apply to non-anaemic women is unclear. A 2023 systematic review examined non-anaemic women, but specified that participants must also be iron-replete. While this is clinically applicable to some countries, it is less relevant in countries like the USA, UK, or Australia where iron studies are not included in routine antenatal screening.

Arguments against routine prophylactic iron supplementation in pregnancy suggest that the harms outweigh the benefits for non-anaemic women. Iron overload and high haemoglobin may be associated with adverse outcomes including preterm birth and foetal growth restriction. Oral iron supplements can also cause unwanted gastrointestinal side effects, however, these harms have not been clearly quantified in the context of pregnancy.

Given the clinical uncertainty, it is critical to reexamine whether universal iron supplementation would provide a net benefit to this population’s health and wellbeing. Our systematic review explores both the benefits and harms of iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women, a key population in the discussion surrounding routine iron supplementation guidelines globally.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^d26ff216]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16-17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### Does the fortified milk with high iron dose improve the neurodevelopment of healthy infants? Randomized controlled trial [^230141a3]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Beyond that, the safety of the higher doses of iron (10–14 mg/L) on babies’ health is unclear as state by the ESPGHAN Nutrition Committee. Given the disagreement about whether the decrease in iron levels in infants is a physiological event or a harmful occurrence, the lack of studies in developed countries and in iron replete infants, and the lack of studies with high doses of iron, our clinical trial assesses the effect of formula milk fortified with the lowest and the highest dose of iron (within the dietary recommendations) between 6 and 12 months of age on the iron–related biochemical status and on the infant’s mental and psychomotor development at 12 months.

The aim was to test the hypothesis that doses in the higher range would benefit development in infants.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^47afb8a2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects mainly children, predominantly in low-income countries and most often due to iron deficiency (ID). Administration of iron supplements to prevent and treat ID anemia in malaria endemic areas has been controversial for decades; however, recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend universal iron supplementation for children in highly prevalent anemia settings, including those where malaria is endemic. However, infants younger than 6 months of age have been exempted from this recommendation because ID is not considered prevalent at this age and because of assumptions—without evidence—that they are protected from ID through breast milk. To achieve full impact of anemia prevention targeting infants less than 6 months of age who are at highest risk of ID, operational studies that conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of delivering iron supplements to young infants in settings with a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, are needed.

### Age of introduction of first complementary feeding for infants: a systematic review [^80eff954]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for the first 6 months of life, followed by introduction of adequate complementary foods (CF). This recommendation is for infants living in developing and developed countries, including Canada. Although there is nearly universal agreement that breast milk alone is the optimal first food, the age range in which solids should be introduced is less clear, leading to “weanling’s dilemma”.

The complementary feeding period accompanies a critical window of vulnerability. During this time period, failure to grow is a significant concern. Micronutrient deficiencies can also occur during this period, mostly because infants have higher nutrient demands relative to increased energy requirements. Deficiencies of certain micronutrients such as iron result in potentially irreversible negative effects on brain development and other detrimental psychological outcomes. There is general, but not universal, agreement that the iron stores of infants start to deplete at about 6 months of age, leaving the infants at high risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. This is especially true among exclusively breastfed infants. The estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among Canadian children aged 1–5 years is 5 % and was found to be five times higher among Inuit children. Therefore, it is important to determine the ideal age to introduce iron-rich CF. Our objectives were to evaluate the current scientific evidence and to investigate the relationship between time of introduction of CF with iron status and growth in breastfed infants. This review includes any relevant studies that targeted exclusively breastfed infants between 4 and 6 months of age.

### Diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in infants and young children (0-3 years of age) [^c5adb8a0]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

This clinical report covers diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in infants (both breastfed and formula fed) and toddlers from birth through 3 years of age. Results of recent basic research support the concerns that iron-deficiency anemia and iron deficiency without anemia during infancy and childhood can have long-lasting detrimental effects on neurodevelopment. Therefore, pediatricians and other health care providers should strive to eliminate iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Appropriate iron intakes for infants and toddlers as well as methods for screening for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are presented.

### Case studies: iron [^228e4a1a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Iron biomarkers were developed to define the size of iron stores and the adequacy of the iron supply required to meet functional needs. Approximately 80% of the iron delivered to tissues through the circulating plasma pool will be incorporated into hemoglobin. Consequently, with the exception of serum ferritin, iron biomarkers are measures of iron sufficiency for erythrocyte production. They have proven to be very valuable in the determination of the cause of anemia in the clinical setting in which additional information about factors that affect the patient's health is available. However, all current biomarkers are affected by factors other than iron status, which limit their utility for the determination of the prevalence of iron deficiency in some populations, particularly in populations who live in developing countries. Furthermore, relations between iron status and functional outcomes such as neonatal and infant mortality; motor, cognitive, and emotional development in infants; and severe morbidity from malaria in young children are inadequately characterized. There is a need to identify and standardize biomarkers that have the highest predictive value for specific functional outcomes in each setting. The most appropriate biomarkers may vary with the setting and be influenced by age, sex, gestational stage of pregnancy, and environmental factors such as repeated or chronic infections. There is also an urgent need for improved technology to permit the use of specific biomarkers in field studies in resource-poor regions. Finally, more research is required to define the potential role of hepcidin and non-transferrin-bound iron assays.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^953b40f8]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prevention in young children—iron deficiency anemia is usually treated with oral iron; the usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses. According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day, and in children ages 1 to 3 years it is 7 mg per day; nonheme iron may be less well absorbed than heme iron such that the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet. Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods, and iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants; federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and more than 50% of the iron in the US food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

### Perspective: putting the youngest among us into the nutrition "call for action" for food fortification strategies [^111281d9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Adequate iron intake is essential for optimal child development, but iron deficiency and anemia among infants and young children are widespread in low- and middle-income countries. Large-scale food fortification strategies hold great promise for reducing micronutrient deficiencies; however, for children <2 y of age, the impact of such strategies is limited because their intake of staple foods is relatively low and fortification levels are targeted at the adult population. Iron supplementation, iron fortification of foods targeted to infants, and point-of-use fortification with iron-containing products such as multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements are evidence-based approaches recommended to reduce anemia among infants and young children when used in the right context. Since 2003, the WHO, with support from UNICEF, has recommended the use of MNPs to control iron deficiency. However, the percentage of children with anemia has changed very little over the past 10 y. Five years ago the UN declared a decade of action on nutrition, including World Health Assembly (WHA) targets for maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, yet the WHA set no anemia targets for children. In July 2020 the leaders of 4 UN agencies issued a call for action to protect children's right to nutrition in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Given persistently high rates of anemia among young children, the negative developmental impact, the challenge of meeting iron needs from typical complementary food diets, and the availability of successful evidence-based fortification strategies for this age group, we encourage planners, speakers, and donors at this year's UN Food Systems Summit and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit to 1) call for the WHA to set anemia targets for infants and young children and 2) promote investment in evidence-based interventions to improve the iron status of young children.

### A substantial proportion of 6-to 12-month-old infants have calculated daily absorbed iron below recommendations, especially those who are breastfed [^d48706be]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To calculate the amount of bioavailable iron consumed among 6- to 12- month-old infants considering differences in iron bioavailability among dietary iron sources and to compare this with current recommended intakes.

Study Design

We used the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study database of dietary intakes from 2016 and the estimated bioavailability of dietary iron sources to evaluate the proportion of infants whose calculated total daily absorbed iron fell below physiologic requirements, that is, the recommended amount needed to fully support growth and erythropoiesis.

Results

The calculated daily iron absorption was below the recommended amount in 54.3% of infants evaluated ranging from 19.5% of 448 exclusively formula-fed infants, to 95.8% of 296 exclusively breastfed infants and 72.2% of 102 mixed fed infants. The calculated mean iron absorption of 6- to 9- month-old breastfed infants was 0.27 mg/day, far less than the estimated physiologic requirement of 0.69 mg/day. The most highly bioavailable iron, heme iron, was <12% of the contributor to total iron absorbed in breastfed infants.

Conclusions

These data indicate a need for further education and public health policies to support increased iron intake in 6- to 12- month-old infants, emphasizing those receiving any breast milk. Exclusively formula-fed infants are at lower risk, but rates of low absorbed iron indicate that all infants may need monitoring for clinical evidence of low iron status. Consideration should be given to increasing the proportion of heme iron obtained from animal products in the diet where feasible.

### Selected macro / micronutrient needs of the routine preterm infant [^b93cb49d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Requirements for optimal nutrition, especially for micronutrients, are not well defined for premature infants. The "reference fetus," developed by Ziegler et al,(1) has served as a model to define nutritional needs and studies designed to determine nutrient requirements. Revision of nutrient requirements and provision of optimal nutrition may lead to improved outcomes in preterm infants. Appropriate provision of nutrients also may help prevent nutritional disorders, such as metabolic bone disease and anemia. In this review, we discuss calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, iron, and copper, and define optimal intakes based on the available published data.

### ABM clinical protocol # 29: iron, zinc, and vitamin D supplementation during breastfeeding [^cdb77a19]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #29—iron, zinc, and vitamin D supplementation recommendations during breastfeeding state that iron supplementation is not required for the non-anemic breastfeeding mother; iron supplementation to the 4-month-old full-term, exclusively breastfed infant is associated with improved hematologic indices, although the long-term benefit at 4–6 months is not known; if iron is provided before 6 months, it should be given as a 1 mg/kg/day distinct iron supplement until iron-fortified cereals or other iron-rich foods are initiated at 6 months of age (LOE IB). Zinc supplementation, above dietary intake, to the lactating mother or breastfeeding infant is not recommended (LOE IB). The breastfeeding infant should receive vitamin D supplementation shortly after birth in doses of 10–20 μg/day (400–800 IU/day) (LOE IB); this supplement should be cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, unless a vegetable source such as ergocalciferol vitamin D2 is desired (LOE IIA), and, when there is objection or contraindication to direct infant supplementation, vitamin D supplementation may be provided to a nursing mother, for whom a maternal dose of 160 μg/day (6,400 IU/day) is suggested.

### Complementary feeding: clinically relevant factors affecting timing and composition [^1c3f0d4c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 mo of life followed by optimal complementary feeding are critical public health measures for reducing and preventing morbidity and mortality in young children. Clinical factors, such as birth weight, prematurity, and illness, that affect the iron and zinc requirements of younger infants are discussed. Maternal diet and nutritional status do not have a strong effect on the mineral content of human milk, but physiologic changes in milk and the infants' status determine the dependence of the infant on complementary foods in addition to human milk to meet iron and zinc requirements after 6 mo. The nature of zinc absorption, which is suitably characterized by saturation response modeling, dictates that plant-based diets, which are low in zinc, are associated with low absolute daily absorbed zinc, which is inadequate to meet requirements. Foods with a higher zinc content, such as meats, are much more likely to be sufficient to meet dietary requirements. Current plant-based complementary feeding patterns for older fully breastfed infants in both developed and developing countries pose a risk of zinc deficiency. The strong rationale for the potential benefits of providing meat as an early complementary food, and the examples of successful intervention programs, provide potent incentives to pursue broader implementation programs, with concurrent rigorous evaluation of both efficacy and effectiveness.

### AAP reports on diagnosis and prevention of iron deficiency anemia (...) [^acef53e0]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Iron is the most common single-nutrient deficiency among children in developing countries and is a common cause of anemia in industrialized nations. Evidence shows that iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during infancy and childhood may have long-lasting detrimental effects on neurodevelopment that may not be reversible. Approximately 80 percent of the iron in newborn infants is accumulated during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, infants born prematurely may be iron deficient. Maternal conditions such as anemia, hypertension with intrauterine growth restriction, or diabetes mellitus can also result in low fetal iron stores. Full-term healthy infants have sufficient iron for at least the first four months of life. Because human milk contains little iron, infants who are breastfed exclusively are at risk of iron deficiency after four months of age and should receive 1 mg of supplemental iron daily per kg of body weight.

Supplementation should continue until iron-containing foods are introduced in the diet. Starting at four months of age, infants who are breastfed for more than one-half of their feedings should also receive 1 mg of supplemental iron daily per kg of body weight. In formula-fed infants, iron needs can be met for the first 12 months of life by using formula that contains 12 mg of iron per dL and by introducing iron-containing foods after four to six months of age. Whole milk should not be given before 12 months of age. Iron intake in infants between six and 12 months of age should be 11 mg per day. Liquid iron supplements are appropriate if iron needs are not being met. Iron intake in children one to three years of age should be 7 mg per day. Liquid supplements are suitable in those who do not receive this intake. Chewable multivitamins can be used in children three years and older. Iron intake in preterm infants should be at least 2 mg per day through 12 months of age.

Preterm infants who are breastfed should receive 2 mg of supplemental iron per kg of body weight each day by one month of age, and supplementation should continue until the infant is weaned to iron-fortified formula or begins to eat foods that supply 2 mg of iron per kg of body weight. Supplementation is not required in infants who have received an iron load from multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells.

### Perspective: putting the youngest among us into the nutrition "call for action" for food fortification strategies [^987ef403]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

For breastfed infants not receiving fortified products, achieving adequate iron intake after 6 mo of age is challenging. Human milk contains relatively little iron (∼0.35 mg/L). Absorption of iron from human milk is variable, but even if 100% is absorbed, iron intake from 600 mL human milk would be only ∼0.2 mg/d. As a result, nearly 100% of the recommended intake of 11 mg/d needs to come from sources other than human milk, i.e. complementary foods. Because breastfed infants have high iron needs but consume small amounts of complementary foods (∼200–300 kcal/d), the iron density of those foods (mg Fe/100 kcal) needs to be very high—9 times higher than required for adult men.

In many populations, iron intake from typical complementary foods is far below the amount needed. Even with “best case scenario family food menus,” the iron density of the hypothetical infant diet among low-income households in Guatemala or India would be far below the target. Linear programming analyses have demonstrated that iron requirements for infants could be met without fortified foods, but only if liver were consumed daily. With more realistic (but not necessarily affordable) diverse dietary patterns that include grains, legumes, egg, green leafy vegetables, and fish or chicken, only 26%–37% of iron needs at 6–8 mo and 35%–52% of iron needs at 9–12 mo could be met. In the second year of life, inadequate iron intake is still prevalent, but with careful selection of foods it is somewhat easier to meet iron needs than is the case at 6–12 mo.

### Iron deficiency in infancy: applying a physiologic framework for prediction [^e1111c74]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Infants aged 6-24 mo are at high risk of iron deficiency. Numerous studies worldwide have sought to identify predictors of iron deficiency in this age group.

Objective

The objectives of the study were to apply a physiologic model to identify risk factors for iron deficiency and to consider those risk factors under different conditions of iron supplementation. We predicted that factors related to iron status at birth (lower gestational age and lower birth weight), postnatal needs for iron (more rapid growth), and bioavailable iron (more cow milk) would be major risk factors.

Design

The physiologic framework was assessed in 1657 Chilean infants (aged 12 mo) with birth weights >or=3 kg who were randomly assigned at age 6 mo to high or low iron supplementation or no added iron. Based on venous blood, the analysis used mean corpuscular volume and concentrations of hemoglobin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and ferritin. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency without anemia.

Results

The prevalence of iron deficiency (>or=2 abnormal iron measures) was 34.9% at age 12 mo. Of 186 infants with hemoglobin concentrations <110 g/L, 158 (84.9%) were iron deficient. The only consistent (and the strongest) predictor of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia was lower 6-mo hemoglobin. Factors related to poorer iron status at birth (lower birth weight, shorter gestation though full-term, or both) were predictors in the no-added-iron and high-iron groups. Otherwise, predictors varied by iron supplementation.

Conclusion

Variations in predictors of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia according to iron supplementation suggest that direct comparisons across studies are tenuous at best without data on early iron status and certainty that specific conditions are comparable.

### Gaps in the evidence for prevention and treatment of maternal anaemia: a review of systematic reviews [^103822a3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

A further priority is to develop standardised approaches to the reporting of laboratory outcomes as the heterogeneity of populations and settings, drug dosages and regimens and definitions of anaemia precluded quantitative analysis for many reviews. Outcomes relevant to the experiences and wellbeing of pregnant women and new mothers need to be included in future randomised controlled trials. Additional work is needed to identify the most effective way of managing anaemia in the postnatal period; validating an effective screening policy for both the ante and postnatal periods; and developing consensus on best practice for the treatment of maternal anaemia, including the dose, route and regimens of drugs including specifically iron. The role of universal supplementation strategies for iron has been evaluated in low-income postpartum women and needs wider consultation, taking into consideration all risks, including differences in rates of unintentional iron ingestion by young children in populations practicing selective versus universal iron supplementation to infants.

### Iron deficiency in the first 6 months of age in infants born between 32 and 37 weeks of gestational age [^09d956bf]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Preterm infants are at risk of iron deficiency (ID). In the Netherlands, preterm infants born after 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) do not receive iron supplementation on a routine basis. We hypothesized that dietary iron intake in these infants might not be sufficient to meet the high iron requirements during the first 6 months of life.

Subjects/Methods

In a prospective cohort study, we analyzed the prevalence and risk factors of ID in 143 infants born between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks GA who did not receive iron supplementation.

Results

ID at the age of 4 and 6 months was present in 27 (18.9%) and 7 (4.9%) infants. Results of a multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that ID was associated with lower birth weight, a shorter duration of formula feeding, more weight gain in the first 6 months of life and lower ferritin concentrations at the age of 1 week.

Conclusions

Preterm infants born after 32 weeks GA have an increased risk of ID compared with those born at term, supporting the need of iron supplementation. Our results suggests that measurement of ferritin at the age of 1 week might be useful to identify those infants at particular risk and could be used in populations without general supplementation programs. However, the efficacy and safety of individualized iron supplementation, based on ferritin concentrations at the age of 1 week, together with other predictors of ID, needs to be further investigated, preferably in a randomized controlled trial.

### Does the fortified milk with high iron dose improve the neurodevelopment of healthy infants? Randomized controlled trial [^68f60588]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present study adds to the body of knowledge on the prevalence of ID and IDA in children. It also provides new data on the effect of iron supplementation in children with doses within the dietary recommendations, at the hematological and neurobehavioral level. So, we can conclude that the intervention with infant formula enriched with iron at the maximum dose within the recommended range, from 6 to 12 months of age, did not show any effect on the neurological development of well–nourished children in a developed country at 12 months. Follow–up studies are needed to test for long–term neurodevelopmental improvement.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^03c1a834]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Iron supplementation for low-birthweight and preterm infants beginning at 2 months of age was recommended in previous WHO guidelines. However, in the new guidelines, there is no mention regarding this group of infants, so it is not clear if the previous recommendation is maintained. Nevertheless, infants younger than 6 months without these risk factors are still not included in any policy on ID prevention.

There is evidence that normal birthweight full-term infants may present anemia prevalences as high as 80% at 3–6 months of age and as high as 90% at 6–9 months of age. Because ID always precedes ID anemia, preventing ID must begin before anemia is manifested to avoid the harmful consequences of both related conditions. Early anemia in life may irreversibly affect the cognitive development and physical growth of infants. Therefore, it is critical to minimize the risks of ID anemia in the first months of life to prevent its consequences when infants are especially susceptible to ID because of their rapid growth.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping is the main proposed strategy to prevent ID and the consequent anemia in young infants.However, although efficacious, in low-income countries, delayed cord clamping is not always easy to implement in busy maternity wards and even less under the conditions of unassisted deliveries that occur in more than 50% of births in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving maternal iron status has been proposed as an intervention to reduce the risk of anemia in infants; however, the relationship between maternal and fetal anemia has been observed in some studies but not in others,, suggesting that the maternal–fetal regulation of iron transport is complex and the factors that determine a newborn’s iron stores are not completely understood. Iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation period, although beneficial for the mothers, has shown little or no effect in preventing anemia in their babies.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^851301f9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research needs—screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are identified as priorities. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of screening (eg, with hemoglobin, hematocrit, or ferritin values) for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal (eg, quality of life or need for transfusion) and infant (eg, low birth weight or preterm birth) health outcomes. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of treatment (eg, oral or intravenous iron) in asymptomatic, screen-detected populations with iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes in settings relevant to US primary care clinical practice. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons without known iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Benefits of iron supplementation for low birth weight infants: a systematic review [^2a89fbdb]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A number of studies have reported on the effects of iron supplementation in low birth weight infants; however, no systematic review of the available evidence has been conducted to date. Hence, we performed a systematic review of the literature to examine the effects of iron supplementation on hematologic iron status, growth, neurodevelopment, and adverse effects in low birth weight/premature infants.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, and PubMed for articles reporting on the effects of iron supplementation in low weight infants. The following search terms were used: "preterm born infant(s)/children"; "preterm infants"; "prematurely born children" "weight less than 1500 g at birth"; "born prematurely"; "low birth weight infant(s)"; "infants born preterm"; "prematurity"; "small-for-gestational age"; "very small gestational age infants"; "iron supplementation"; "iron intake"; "iron supplements"; "ferric and/or ferrous compounds"; and "ferrous sulphate/fumarate/sulfate".

Results

A total of 15 studies were identified and included in the systematic review. Supplemental iron was given orally or as an iron-fortified formula in 14/15 studies. The duration of treatment ranged from 1 week to 18 months. Iron supplementation significantly increased hematologic measures of iron status (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin) relative to placebo or over time in most studies. All controlled studies that examined iron-deficiency anemia (IDA)/ID reported a decreased prevalence of IDA/ID with iron supplementation. Dose dependent decreases in the prevalence of IDA/ID were reported in several studies. Of the 5 studies reporting on growth, none found any significant effect on growth-related parameters (length, height, weight, and head circumference). Only 2 studies reported on neurodevelopment; no marked effects were reported. There were no consistently reported adverse effects, including oxidative stress, inhibited nutrient absorption, morbidity, or the requirement for blood transfusion.

Conclusion

The available data suggest that iron supplementation increases the levels of hematologic indicators of iron status and reduces the prevalence of IDA/ID in low birth weight/premature infants. There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive statement regarding the effects of iron supplementation on growth, neurodevelopment, or the occurrence of adverse effects in low birth weight/premature infants.

### The effect of iron supplementation in preterm infants at different gestational ages [^74869fba]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonates mostly acquire iron from their mothers throughout late gestation. Early preterm infants may have significantly lower body iron levels than late preterm infants. Current guidelines for preventing iron deficiency in preterm infants are based on studies of iron status in early preterm infants (gestational age < 34 weeks), with few studies on iron status in late preterm infants and a lack of studies on iron status in preterm infants of various gestational ages. This study classified preterm infants into two groups based on gestational age: early preterm infants and late preterm infants. By comparing their iron metabolism and physical growth indicators, we evaluated whether the present iron supplementation regimen could meet the iron demand of early preterm infants and if it resulted in iron overload in late preterm infants.

### Age of introduction of first complementary feeding for infants: a systematic review [^82c6f7f4]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a World Health Organization recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding of all full-term infants to 6 months of age, it is not clear what the health implications may be. Breast milk alone may not meet the nutrition needs for all growing infants, leaving them at risk for deficiencies. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between moderate (4 months) versus late (6 months) introduction of complementary foods to the full-term breastfed infant on iron status and growth.

Methods

An electronic search of peer-reviewed and gray-literature was conducted for randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational studies related to the timing of introduction of complementary foods. Iron status and growth data from the relevant RCTs were analyzed using RevMan 5.2.11.

Results

Three RCTs and one observational study met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed significantly higher hemoglobin levels in infants fed solids at 4 months versus those fed solids at 6 months in developing countries [mean difference [MD]: 5.0 g/L; 95% CI: 1.5, 8.5 g/L; P = 0.005]. Meta-analysis also showed higher serum ferritin levels in the 4-month group in both developed and developing countries [MD: 26.0 μg/L; 95% CI: -0.1, 52.1 μg/L, P = 0.050], [MD: 18.9 μg/L; 95% CI: 0.7, 37.1 μg/L, P = 0.040]. Short follow-up periods and small sample sizes of the included studies were the major limitations.

Conclusions

RCT evidence suggests the rate of iron deficiency anemia in breastfed infants could be positively altered by introduction of solids at 4 months.

### Development of iron homeostasis in infants and young children [^39dcd0bc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Healthy, term, breastfed infants usually have adequate iron stores that, together with the small amount of iron that is contributed by breast milk, make them iron sufficient until ≥6 mo of age. The appropriate concentration of iron in infant formula to achieve iron sufficiency is more controversial. Infants who are fed formula with varying concentrations of iron generally achieve sufficiency with iron concentrations of 2 mg/L (i.e., with iron status that is similar to that of breastfed infants at 6 mo of age). Regardless of the feeding choice, infants' capacity to regulate iron homeostasis is important but less well understood than the regulation of iron absorption in adults, which is inverse to iron status and strongly upregulated or downregulated. Infants who were given daily iron drops compared with a placebo from 4 to 6 mo of age had similar increases in hemoglobin concentrations. In addition, isotope studies have shown no difference in iron absorption between infants with high or low hemoglobin concentrations at 6 mo of age. Together, these findings suggest a lack of homeostatic regulation of iron homeostasis in young infants. However, at 9 mo of age, homeostatic regulatory capacity has developed although, to our knowledge, its extent is not known. Studies in suckling rat pups showed similar results with no capacity to regulate iron homeostasis at 10 d of age when fully nursing, but such capacity occurred at 20 d of age when pups were partially weaned. The major iron transporters in the small intestine divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin were not affected by pup iron status at 10 d of age but were strongly affected by iron status at 20 d of age. Thus, mechanisms that regulate iron homeostasis are developed at the time of weaning. Overall, studies in human infants and experimental animals suggest that iron homeostasis is absent or limited early in infancy largely because of a lack of regulation of the iron transporters DMT1 and ferroportin.

### The effect of iron supplementation in preterm infants at different gestational ages [^e5c8b44a]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron is an essential micronutrient for cellular activities such as hemoglobin synthesis, DNA synthesis, energy metabolism, electron transfer, and cellular differentiation. It is also important for infant and child neurodevelopment, physical growth, and immune function. Preterm infants have a much greater risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia than term infants due to inadequate iron stores, a relatively short red blood cell lifespan, postnatal catch-up growth, and medical blood loss. The prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in preterm infants varies by country, geography, and age and can reach 48% and 26.5%, respectively. Prior to the development of IDA, ID can cause irreparable damage to the nervous system. It is especially crucial to identify and treat iron deficiency early in preterm infant s.

Preterm infants require substantially more iron than term infants since they need to catch up on growth. In the absence of exogenous iron supplementation, preterm infants’ innate iron stores can only meet the iron requirements for catch-up and double birth weight. Food sources of iron are inadequate to meet the iron demands of preterm infant s, and oral iron supplements are frequently required. There are no defined guidelines for the starting time, dose, or finishing time of oral iron intake for preterm infants. According to China’s Recommendations for the Prevention and Control of Iron Deficiency and Iron Deficiency Anemia in Children, preterm infant s should begin receiving iron supplements (2–4 mg/kg/d) two weeks after delivery.

Hepcidin is one of the main regulators of iron metabolism. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, internalizing and degrading it. This reduces the release of iron from hepatocytes, macrophages, and intestinal cells into the bloodstream, resulting in decreased dietary iron absorption and serum iron, and increased intracellular iron. Compared to healthy newborns, infants with ID exhibited significantly decreased hepcidin levels at 1.5 months of age. This shows that hepcidin can be an early indicator of newborn iron status. Little research has been conducted on the hepcidin level in preterm infants, and further research is still needed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of hepcidin for the diagnosis of ID and IDA in preterm infants.

### Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and neonatal development [^b0f40959]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects 36% of pregnant women worldwide. Of those affected, around 40% is due to iron deficiency (ID). Iron is an essential micronutrient involved in vital processes such as erythropoiesis, immune responses, and importantly-during pregnancy-placental and fetal development. Although menstrual bleeding can impact the incidence of ID even before the onset of pregnancy, this narrative review is pregnancy focused and will explore the impact of ID on placental development and iron uptake, fetal development and immunity, and maternal and infant susceptibility to infection. Although there have been advances in this area of research, much is needed to understand the regulation of iron and the effects of ID during pregnancy. Notably, more human studies are essential to generate the best evidence to advance strategies to reduce the incidence of ID during pregnancy to improve maternal, neonatal, and infant health.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^8f205988]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron

Iron is an essential nutrient that assists with the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to bodily tissues. A diet deficient in iron can negatively impact muscle metabolism, cognitive development, and growth. Excess iron intake results in oxidative stress, which is associated with hemochromatosis, some cancers, premature aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis.

Sex differences with respect to physiologic requirements for iron intake are well established. Adult females require more iron than adult males because of the loss of iron in their blood during menses. On the other hand, preadolescent males show a higher prevalence of iron deficiency anemia than preadolescent females. Iron levels tend to increase in postmenopausal women and decrease in males of similar age and status.The Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine therefore recommends higher dietary allowances of iron for females aged 14–50 years than for their male counterparts. In addition, because the physiologic requirements of iron in females are further complicated by pregnancy and lactation, current recommendations support higher dietary allowances of iron in pregnant females and lower dietary allowances of iron in lactating females than in nonpregnant and nonlactating females.

In fact, maternal physiologic iron requirements fluctuate throughout pregnancy. During the first trimester, iron requirements decrease because of the cessation of menses, and iron stores may increase. During the second trimester, physiologic iron requirements increase due to expansion of maternal blood volume and red cell mass. Linear increases in iron requirements continue through the third trimester as iron accumulates in the placenta to support the development of infant red blood cells.

In healthy pregnant women with adequate prepregnancy iron stores, the increased iron requirements are balanced by more efficient iron absorption from the diet, improved oxygen delivery to the tissues, and increased heart output.Assuming that 300 mg of stored iron reserves are adequate in prepregnant females, then ∼50% of women in the United States achieve this status.On the other hand, as many as 35% of women in the United States have depleted or nearly depleted iron reserves and are considered iron deficient.To offset a potential imbalance in iron reserves during pregnancy and prevent maternal iron deficiency anemia, routine iron supplementation is widely practiced.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women to improve maternal health and birth outcomes: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^4977b270]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2006 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention (oral supplementation or treatment) in pregnant women and adolescents and improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes.

Population

This recommendation applies to pregnant women and adolescents living in the United States who do not have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. It does not address pregnant women who are malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, or have special hematologic conditions or nutritional needs that may increase their need for iron.

Recommendations

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes. (I statement).

### Prevention of iron deficiency in infants and toddlers [^ca449896]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of nutritional iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers has declined dramatically since 1960. However, satisfaction with this achievement must be tempered because iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers is associated with long-lasting diminished mental, motor, and behavioral functioning. Additionally, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in one- to three-year-old children seems to be increasing. The exact relationship between iron deficiency anemia and the developmental effects is not well understood, but these effects do not occur until iron deficiency becomes severe and chronic enough to produce anemia. At that point, treatment with iron can reverse the anemia and restore iron sufficiency, yet the poorer developmental functioning appears to persist. Therefore, intervention should focus on the primary prevention of iron deficiency. In the first year of life, measures to prevent iron deficiency include completely avoiding cow's milk, starting iron supplementation at four to six months of age in breastfed infants, and using iron-fortified formula when not breastfeeding. Low-iron formula should not be used. In the second year of life, iron deficiency can be prevented by use of a diversified diet that is rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, limiting cow's milk consumption to less than 24 oz per day, and providing a daily iron-fortified vitamin. All infants and toddlers who did not receive primary prevention should be screened for iron deficiency. Screening is performed at nine to 12 months, six months later, and at 24 months of age. The hemoglobin/hematocrit level alone detects only patients with enough iron deficiency to be anemic. Screening by erythrocyte protoporphyrin or red-cell distribution width identifies earlier stages of iron deficiency. A positive screening test is an indication for a therapeutic trial of iron, which remains the definitive method of establishing a diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Complementary feeding and micronutrient status: a systematic review [^fd71386e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Proper nutrition during early life is critical for growth and development.

Objectives

The aim was to describe systematic reviews conducted by the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team for the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project to answer the following: What is the relation between 1) timing of introduction of complementary foods and beverages (CFBs) or 2) types and/or amounts of CFBs consumed and micronutrient status (iron, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B-12, folate, and fatty acid status)?

Methods

A literature search identified articles from developed countries published from January 1980 to July 2016 that met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and risk of bias assessed. Evidence was qualitatively synthesized to develop a conclusion statement, and the strength of the evidence was graded.

Results

Nine articles addressed the timing of CFB introduction and 31 addressed types or amounts or both of CFBs. Moderate evidence suggests that introducing CFBs at age 4 mo instead of 6 mo offers no advantages or disadvantages in iron status among healthy full-term infants. Evidence is insufficient on the timing of CFB introduction and other micronutrient status outcomes. Strong evidence suggests that CFBs containing iron (e.g., meat, fortified cereal) help maintain adequate iron status or prevent deficiency in the first year among infants at risk of insufficient iron stores or low intake. Benefits for infants with sufficient iron stores (e.g., infant formula consumers) are less clear. Moderate evidence suggests that CFBs containing zinc (e.g., meat, fortified cereal) support zinc status in the first year and CFB fatty acid composition influences fatty acid status. Evidence is insufficient with regard to types and amounts of CFBs and vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and folate status, or the relation between lower-iron-containing CFBs and micronutrient status.

Conclusions

Several conclusions on CFBs and micronutrient status were drawn from these systematic reviews, but more research that addresses specific gaps and limitations is needed.

### Iron | Breastfeeding special circumstances (...) [^1e654500]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Iron is needed for brain development during infancy and early childhood. Learn about the iron needs of breastfed infants. Do infants get enough iron from breast milk. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin that carries oxygen in red blood cells to all parts of the body. Iron also supports brain development during infancy and early childhood. For about the first 6 months of life, most newborns have sufficient iron stored in their bodies. However, their iron status depends on gestational age, maternal iron status, and timing of umbilical cord clamping. Breast milk contains little iron. Parents of infants receiving only breast milk should talk to their infant's health care provider about whether their infant needs iron supplements in the first 6 months and afterwards. At about 6 months, infants require a source of iron outside of breast milk. An infant's iron needs can be met through iron-rich foods, iron-fortified cereals, or iron supplement drops.

### Understanding the interactions between iron supplementation, infectious disease and adverse birth outcomes is essential to guide public health recommendations [^bccddf24]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding the complex interactions between nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases is vital for informing key policy and treatment guidelines in resource-poor settings to ensure gains in maternal and child health. Pregnant women are highly susceptible to anaemia and iron deficiency due to the increased iron demands of pregnancy in conjunction with other factors. To prevent these conditions from developing and to improve newborn and infant outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends universal iron supplementation throughout pregnancy together with “measures to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria” in malaria-endemic areas. However, there are concerns regarding the value of antenatal iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas due to reports of increased risk of malaria in those receiving iron supplementation. These issues are compounded by a lack of understanding of how iron deficiency, anaemia and malaria may interact to influence birth outcomes. Additionally, published reports indicate variable effects of iron supplementation in pregnancy on newborn outcomes. In our recent article published in BMC Medicine, we investigated iron deficiency and pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of Papua New Guinean women and found that iron deficiency in pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of adverse birth outcomes (low birthweight and premature delivery); this association was not simply explained by a potential protective effect of iron deficiency against malaria. We hypothesised that an interaction between iron deficiency and other infectious diseases may explain the observed effect or that other nutritional factors may be contributing to these associations. Furthermore, it is essential to understand the mechanism(s) underlying these interactions in resource-limited settings where the burden of infectious diseases and poor nutrition are high. While our findings raise questions about the benefits of iron supplementation in these settings and shed light on potential causal pathways, they do not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend that iron supplementation be stopped in pregnancy. Furthermore, there are other benefits of iron supplementation for the mother and infant that need to be considered in policy decisions. Instead, we concluded that it is essential to provide both iron supplementation for anaemia and effective malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy according to current WHO policy, integrated with interventions that address other nutritional deficiencies or infections that may potentially achieve greater health benefits.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^89912ded]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Nutrient density in complementary feeding of infants and toddlers [^8e77fa24]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The paradigm of the first 1000 days of life, the period from conception to the second birthday, has been advanced as a critical window of opportunity to save a life and a child's future. Infancy and toddler life, through the first 24 months after birth, is a unique period during which human milk is recommended as either the exclusive source of nutrition (6 months) or a variable component thereof. After the maternal delivery of milk is accounted for, the remainder of the energy and nutrients needs come from complementary foods. There is an intrinsic gap left by the maternal milk supply in volume and micronutrient content in relation to expanding infant and toddler needs. The nutrient density approach provides us with a mathematical framework to manage the closing of the nutrient gap. The intrinsic nutrient content of the unprocessed foods appropriate for young children is limited. The most problematic nutrients are calcium, iron and zinc. Some manner to enhance the nutrient density of the complementary foods is an incontestable necessity. The nutrient density consideration, which identifies for us the nature of the problem, offers a tool for the titrating of the fortification to an adequate--but safe--addition.

### Nutrition, growth, and complementary feeding of the breastfed infant [^aa3899b8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Although additional research is needed on many of the issues discussed herein, the following conclusions are well substantiated by the evidence available to date: Breast milk alone can meet nutrient needs during the first 6 months, with the possible exception of vitamin D in certain populations and iron in infants of relatively low birth weight. Complementary foods offered before 6 months of age tend to displace breast milk and do not confer any growth advantage over exclusive breastfeeding. Breast milk continues to provide substantial amounts of key nutrients well beyond the first year of life, especially protein, fat, and most vitamins. Breastfed infants tend to gain less weight and usually are leaner than are formula-fed infants in the second half of infancy. This difference does not seem to be the result of nutritional deficits but rather infant self-regulation of energy intake. New growth charts based on infants breastfed throughout the first year of life are being developed by WHO. The nutrients most likely to be limiting in the diets of breastfed infants are minerals, such as iron, zinc, and calcium. Using the following guidelines can help to ensure that the nutrient needs of the breastfed child are met: Continue to breastfeed as often as the infant desires. Aim for a variety of complementary foods, with fruits, vegetables, and animal products (e.g., meat, fish, poultry, or egg) offered daily. Iron-fortified cereals and meats can provide adequate iron. Calcium can be obtained from cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products (although fresh cow's milk is not recommended before 12 mo). Avoid giving too much juice. Be alert to any signs that the child's appetite, growth, or development is impaired. When in doubt, a balanced vitamin-mineral supplement is advisable. Make mealtimes enjoyable.

Infancy and prematurity—iron needs and depletion patterns indicate that healthy term infants have sufficient iron stores until approximately 6 months of age and that from 6 to 24 months of age iron requirements per kilogram of body weight are higher than during any other period; in premature infants, iron stores are depleted in 6–8 weeks and the Hb nadir is lower and occurs earlier in those with gestational age 28–32 weeks compared to term infants.

### Integrating themes, evidence gaps, and research needs identified by workshop on iron screening and supplementation in iron-replete pregnant women and young children [^4df32cd0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

This report addresses the evidence and the uncertainties, knowledge gaps, and research needs identified by participants at the NIH workshop related to iron screening and routine iron supplementation of largely iron-replete pregnant women and young children (6-24 mo) in developed countries. The workshop presentations and panel discussions focused on current understanding and knowledge gaps related to iron homeostasis, measurement of and evidence for iron status, and emerging concerns about supplementing iron-replete members of these vulnerable populations. Four integrating themes emerged across workshop presentations and discussion and centered on 1 ) physiologic or developmental adaptations of iron homeostasis to pregnancy and early infancy, respectively, and their implications, 2 ) improvement of the assessment of iron status across the full continuum from iron deficiency anemia to iron deficiency to iron replete to iron excess, 3 ) the linkage of iron status with health outcomes beyond hematologic outcomes, and 4 ) the balance of benefit and harm of iron supplementation of iron-replete pregnant women and young children. Research that addresses these themes in the context of the full continuum of iron status is needed to inform approaches to the balancing of benefits and harms of screening and routine supplementation.

### Effect of infant feeding practices on iron status in a cohort study of Bolivian infants [^b245477e]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency, affecting an estimated 40% of children under 5 and 38% of pregnant women globally. If uncorrected, ID can progress into iron deficiency anemia (IDA); ID and IDA have been associated with potentially irreversible deficits in cognitive development in infants and children.

Infants have high iron needs due to their rapid growth. Young infants are thought to be protected from ID via their birth iron stores, which are largely accumulated during the last trimester of gestation and depleted through the first 4 – 6 months of life. Yet ID has been identified even in very young populations of healthy infants, raising questions about optimal infant and young child feeding and supplementation practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF; defined as no foods or liquids other than breast milk and supplements or medications) for infants up to 6 months of age, due to the excellent nutritional content and demonstrated immunological benefits of breast milk. However, although the iron in breast milk is highly bioavailable, it is present in only small amounts, prompting discussion as to whether EBF should be recommended only to 4 months of age (as in earlier recommendations) as opposed to 6 months of age. In multiple studies, the length of EBF or predominant breastfeeding (PRBF) has been associated with poorer iron status, while in other studies, EBF has not been associated with iron status, or has been associated with some markers of iron status, but not others.

### National recommendations for infant and young child feeding in the World Health Organization European region [^b17dc88c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Complementary feeding should provide a healthy diet with critical nutrients for growth and development. Information is limited on child and infant feeding recommendations within the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region.

Methods

The WHO Regional Office for Europe and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) performed a survey of national recommendations on infant and young child nutrition aimed at national government departments of health and national paediatric experts. Questions addressed national recommendations on breast-feeding and complementary feeding.

Results

Information was available from 48 of the 53 Member States. Forty-five of 48 countries (94%) have national recommendations on infant and young child feeding, of which 41 are endorsed by official public health authorities. Regarding introduction of complementary feeding, 25 countries (out of 34, 74%) recommend 6 months of age as the ideal age. The earliest age of introduction recommended varies from 4 to 5 months in (31/38 countries, 82%) to 6 months (6/38, 16%) and 7 months (1/38, 2.6%). The recommended meal composition varies widely; introduction of iron-rich foods (meat, fish, eggs) at the age of 6 months is recommended in 30 out of 43 countries, whereas 13 (30%) recommend later introduction.

Conclusions

National infant feeding recommendations vary widely between studied countries and partly differ from international recommendations. Too early introduction of complementary feeding can reduce duration of exclusive breast-feeding (EBF). Too late introduction of iron-rich complementary foods might increase anemia risk and adversely affect child development. A review and further harmonization of national recommendations appears desirable.

### Canadian infants' nutrient intakes from complementary foods during the first year of life [^c357a57a]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Iron Intakes

The relatively low intake of iron from CF is also a concern as iron stores are depleted by six months of age and the concentration of iron in breast milk is insignificant. Beyond six months of age, the majority of infants' daily iron must be supplied by CF. Mean daily iron intakes from CF were lower than recommended for subjects aged seven to 12 months. Most of the CF consumed by these infants does not contain significant amounts of iron, with the exception of iron-fortified infant foods and red meats. For example, Heinz canned fruits and vegetables provide 2 to 10% of infants' daily value of iron per jar, while their canned meat and combination dishes provide no more than 20% of daily iron/jar). Of the most commonly consumed CF (cereals, fruits, and vegetables), only infant cereals contain an appreciable amount of iron (approximately 90-100% of daily value). Intakes of meat, poultry, fish, and dairy (eggs) were not significant until eight to nine months of age (Table 4). The FIT study found that infant cereal was the most important complementary source of all minerals, except sodium and potassium, for infants.

Infant foods are fortified with either elemental iron or ferric pyrophosphate, both of which provide iron of low bioavailability. Although iron-fortified infant formulas contain highly absorbable iron (ferrous sulfate), not all infants receive formula. Iron status is an issue for Canadian infants with 24% reported to have low iron stores. To ensure infants aged six to 12 months are able to meet their daily iron requirements, fortification with other forms of iron and addition of absorption-enhancing compounds (such as ascorbic acid) may need to be considered.

Health Canada recommends iron-containing foods, including cooked egg yolks, as the first CF. Egg yolks contain 1.3 times more iron per gram than ground beef and one yolk provides 6% and 12% of infants' daily recommended iron and vitamin D, respectively. As a result, egg yolks may be the perfect complement to breast milk and formula.

### Sources of supplemental iron among breastfed infants during the first year of life [^b001810b]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Primary prevention of iron deficiency requires adequate iron intake. Although recommendations exist to promote adequate intake of iron among infants through iron-rich foods and iron supplements, few studies have examined adherence to these recommendations. Our objectives were to describe the consumption of iron-rich foods, oral iron supplements, and iron-fortified formula among US infants and to assess adherence to iron-intake recommendations.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, a longitudinal study of mothers and infants followed from late pregnancy through the first year of their infant's life. Mothers completed near-monthly questionnaires that assessed how frequently they fed their infants breast milk, formula, infant cereals, and meats in the previous 7 days and whether their infants were given an oral iron supplement > or = 3 times per week during the previous 2 weeks. We examined use of iron-fortified formula among infants who consumed formula; intake of cereal, meat, oral iron supplements, and formula among infants consuming any breast milk; and whether 6-month-old breastfed and mixed-fed (breast milk and formula) infants consumed sources of supplemental iron with recommended frequency.

Results

At 6 months of age, 18% of the term breastfed and mixed-fed infants had not received infant cereal or meat in the previous 7 days, and 15% had not received infant cereal, meat, regular iron supplements, or formula; among solely breastfed infants, 23% had not received infant cereal, meat, or regular iron supplements. Fifty-eight percent of the mixed-fed infants and 70% of the solely breastfed infants received < 2 daily servings of infant cereal, meat, or formula combined and did not receive oral iron supplements > or = 3 times per week. Among preterm breastfed and mixed-fed infants, none received oral iron supplements > or = 3 times per week before 3 months of age, 2% received them at 3 months, and 13% received them at 10.5 months.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that recommendations regarding iron intake among breastfed infants are not being followed by a substantial proportion of mothers.

### Does the fortified milk with high iron dose improve the neurodevelopment of healthy infants? Randomized controlled trial [^4165501c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are public health problems even in developed countries, especially during childhood. The prevalence of ID ranges from 2 to 29% in Europe and between 9.6 and 23.3% in Spain, depending on the age group and geographical area.

Babies are born with high iron stores, which decline progressively during the first 6 months of life, as a result of the rapid growth of the baby. Processes such as the increasing circulating blood volume, hemoglobin (Hb) formation and brain development require a great supply of iron, and turn the sixth month into a critical point in the infant’s health status. Some researchers argue that it is a natural process known as “physiological anemia of infancy”. However, because of the important role that iron plays in several physiological processes, some recent researches focus on establishing whether ID and IDA entail a pathological situation in the physical or psychological development of children. In this regard, a recent systematic review recommends some strategies to reduce IDA in critical periods of early childhood.

Although several authors showed that iron fortification improves the infant’s hematological profile, a systematic review warned that the evidences are inconsistent. The findings about the effect of iron fortification in young children on their neurodevelopment are also controversial. There were some evidences of a benefits on the children’s neurodevelopment and growth following the iron fortification in Chile, China, Indonesia and several low–income countries, as it was shown by some systematic reviews. On the contrary, some others did not observe advantages in neurodevelopment or growth after iron intervention both in anemic and iron–sufficient healthy children. Even, Lozoff et al. found worse neuropsychological scores in 10–year–old children who had been fed with formula milk fortified with high iron content (mean, 12.7 mg/L) from 6 to 12 months, compared with those who were fed with formula milk fortified with low doses of iron (mean, 2.3 mg/L). Thus, systematic reviews by Martins et al. and Wang et al. did not find sufficient evidence to give a definitive conclusion about the advantages and disadvantages of iron fortification in children. On the other hand, iron is an essential nutrient for the growth of some bacteria so it has been argued that ID may be a defense mechanism against some pathogens and, conversely, it is associated with a worse immune state, which may increase the susceptibility to infection and, consequently, affect the child’s development.

### The effect of iron supplementation in preterm infants at different gestational ages [^88b68d97]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency disease in preterm infants, significantly affecting their growth and development. For preterm infants to flourish physically and neurologically, timely iron supplementation is essential. The main goals of this study were to determine whether the present iron supplementation regimen results in iron overload in late preterm infants and whether it can meet the growth requirements of early preterm infants for catch-up.

Methods

We conducted a prospective follow-up study on preterm infants at the Department of Child Health, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020. In this study, 177 preterm infants were divided into two groups based on gestational age—early preterm infants (gestational age < 34 weeks) and late preterm infants (gestational age ≥ 34 weeks and < 37 weeks)—to compare the incidence of iron deficiency, iron status, and physical growth of preterm infants receiving iron supplements (2–4 mg/kg/d).

Results

Iron supplementation considerably reduced the incidence of iron deficiency in preterm infants. The prevalence of iron deficiency in early preterm infants and late preterm infants was 11.3% and 5.1%, respectively, at the corrected gestational age of 3 months; at the corrected gestational age of 6 months, the prevalence was 5.3% and 6.3%, respectively. No preterm infants with iron deficiency were detected in either group at the corrected gestational age of 12 months. Ferritin was substantially lower in early preterm infants (36.87 ± 31.57 ng/ml) than in late preterm infants (65.78 ± 75.76 ng/ml) at the corrected gestational age of 3 months (p < 0.05). A multifactorial regression analysis of factors influencing iron metabolism levels in preterm infants revealed a positive relationship between log 10 hepcidin, birth weight, and ferritin, with higher birth weights resulting in higher ferritin levels.

Conclusions

Postnatal iron supplementation at 2–4 mg/kg/d in preterm infants significantly decreases the incidence of ID. There were substantial differences in iron levels across preterm infants of varying gestational ages. A tailored iron supplementation plan based on growth, birth weight, and gestational age may be a more suitable route for iron supplementation. Although the current study found that the postnatal iron status of early preterm infants differed from that of late preterm infants, the actual mechanism of action remains unknown, and large-sample, multicenter clinical studies are required to investigate this further.

### Iron deficiency in infants and toddlers in the United States [^54362d98]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be overwhelmingly the leading cause of anemia in early childhood and a global public health challenge. Although there has been a significant decrease in the frequency of IDA and iron deficiency (ID) in infants and toddlers in recent years in the United States, ID and IDA persist and the adverse effects of ID are long-lasting if not permanent. Moreover, ID can result in lead toxicity, and this toxic exposure, even with low levels, can impair neurocognitive function as well. This review describes the major steps that have taken place to decrease the frequency of ID and IDA.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^f56b2ee0]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended daily intake of iron ranges from 7 to 13 mg daily (adapted from EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens) (Table 5). Many factors influence iron requirements, including age, sex and iron status, among others. Children who follow vegetarian or vegan diets require a higher iron intake since non‐heme iron is less bioavailable than heme iron. Cow's milk is low in iron (0.1–0.2 mg per 240 mL) and is, therefore, not suitable for infants. In infants who are not breastfed, the only adequate source of iron is iron‐fortified infant formula. By 6 months of age, the infant's endogenous iron stores will have been used up. Therefore, early introduction of foods rich in iron is recommended during complementary feeding period.Table 6 lists the iron content of selected foods (adapted from Iron Fact Sheet for Health Professionals).

Iron content of selected foods.

6.2.2 Oral iron

Oral iron preparations are relatively inexpensive and easily available but may cause GI side effects such as constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea while also having an effect on the intestinal microbiome.

There are numerous iron preparations, most of them available as over‐the‐counter supplements with or without other vitamins or minerals, which may result in uncertainty for both patients and physicians. Ferrous sulphate is, currently, the most frequently used formulation, whereas ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and carbonyl iron have also demonstrated efficacy as iron supplements for prevention and treatment of IDA.The elemental iron content of ferrous sulphate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate is 20%, 11.6% and 33%, respectively. Iron polysaccharide combinations are hydrated microspheres remaining in solution over a wide range of pH values, theoretically allowing for improved absorption and tolerability.

### The effect of iron supplementation in preterm infants at different gestational ages [^f446bd10]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There were substantial differences in iron levels across preterm infants of varying gestational ages. Specifically, late preterm infants had an iron status that was significantly different from that of early preterm infants and closer to that of term newborns. Postnatal iron supplementation at 2–4 mg/kg/d in preterm infants significantly decreases the incidence of ID; however, iron supplementation based on a single standard may not fully satisfy the need for early preterm infant catch-up growth because of the multitude of factors affecting preterm iron stores and the wide variation in total iron content in preterm infants. For preterm infants, a tailored iron supplementation plan based on growth, birth weight, and gestational age may be a more suitable route for iron supplementation. Although the current study revealed that the postnatal iron status of early preterm infants differed from that of late preterm infants, our study was a single-center clinical investigation, and current evidence does not fully explain the pattern of iron metabolism in preterm newborns. A large-sample, multicenter clinical study is required to elucidate the causes of this variation and the precise mechanism of action.

### Benefits of iron supplementation for low birth weight infants: a systematic review [^ce66d3d9]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library, Medline, and PubMed databases were searched from inception to June 2011. We limited the searches to include only articles written in English using the following terms: “preterm born infant(s) / children”; “preterm infants”; “prematurely born children” “weight less than 1500 g at birth”; “born prematurely”; “low birth weight infant(s)”; “infants born preterm”; “prematurity”; “small-for-gestational age”; “very small gestational age infants”; “iron supplementation”; “iron intake”; “iron supplements”; “ferric and/or ferrous compounds”; and “ferrous sulphate / fumarate / sulfate”. Boolean operators (not, and, or) were also used in succession to narrow and widen the search. To locate unpublished materials and avoid systemic bias, we manually searched the references lists of original and review articles for symposia proceedings, poster presentations, and abstract from major pediatric association meetings.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they involved infants who were of low birth weight (< 2500 g) or premature (gestational age < 35 weeks) and received iron supplementation through the enteral (formula or iron drops) or parenteral routes. Studies involving supplementation of other micronutrients were also eligible for inclusion if the only difference between the treatment and the control groups was iron supplementation.

Studies were excluded if there was no definite length of treatment available, or if supplementation was combined erythropoietin treatment.

The search and inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed by an investigative team, including experts in the field of pediatric development and nutrient research. Our team included a biostatistician who was instrumental in defining the criteria.

Study Selection

The first step in study selection was the exclusion of duplicates (ie, reports of the same study). The title and abstract of the trials retrieved in the search were scanned and studies that were obviously irrelevant were excluded. The full text of each remaining study was reviewed to establish eligibility and all relevant information and data were extracted.

### Early versus delayed cord clamping in small for gestational age infants and iron stores at 3 months of age-a randomized controlled trial [^bcd9179b]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The umbilical cord acts as a conduit for gas exchange, nourishment and endocrinal homeostasis of the fetus. Umbilical cord clamping signifies a landmark period to transform the fetus to an independent entity. Two commonly practiced techniques of cord clamping are – “early cord clamping” (ECC) (clamping in less than 1 min after birth) and “delayed cord clamping” (DCC) (clamping at 1 to 3 min of birth).

DCC has become a standard of care in infants not requiring resuscitation. DCC provides 25–35 ml of blood per kg in term infant (equivalent to 1–3 months of infant’s iron requirements) and improves iron stores leading to reduction in iron deficiency. Iron deficiency during the fetal or postnatal period can alter brain structure, neurochemistry and cognitive function. This can lead to long term cognitive and motor impairment, which cannot be corrected by iron supplementation later in life.

Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are those with birth weight less than 10th centile for the gestation and sex. Studies have shown that these infants have low iron stores at birth and are at risk of developing iron deficiency later. This is due to placental vascular insufficiency mediated impairment in iron transport and increased utilization of iron to meet chronic hypoxia induced erythropoiesis. ECC would deprive them of additional placental blood, further accentuating the risk of iron deficiency. However these infants have an inherent risk of polycythemia and its related complications, which may be aggravated by DCC. Cord clamping strategies in SGA infants and their clinical impact has not been evaluated systematically in randomized controlled trials. We conducted this study to compare the effect of two cord clamping strategies on early neonatal outcomes and iron stores at 3 months of age.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^8bd648aa]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children—test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Gaps in evidence regarding iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and young children: summary of US preventive services task force recommendations [^df7fc760]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations to primary care providers regarding preventive services for asymptomatic patients. Recommendations are based on the scientific evidence that the delivery of the preventive service leads to improvements in meaningful patient outcomes. After a review of the available evidence, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend routine iron supplementation for pregnant women or routine screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women or young children. The USPSTF identified a critical evidence gap that is related to whether changing hematologic indexes in otherwise asymptomatic pregnant women or in infants within populations who are reflective of the United States leads to an improvement in maternal or child health outcomes. Future research opportunities are described to address these important evidence gaps.

### Prevention of iron deficiency in infants and toddlers | AAFP (...) [^9bc69a19]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

12 Yet, exclusive breastfeeding after four to six months puts infants at risk for iron deficiency. Therefore, some form of dietary iron supplement that provides 1 mg elemental iron per kg per day is recommended for term infants starting at four 22, 23 to six 12, 20 months of age. Iron-fortified cereal can help meet this requirement 24; however, many cereal-fed infants still develop iron deficiency anemia.
25. To prevent iron deficiency, another option is a daily oral iron supplement, using ferrous sulfate drops 26 or infant vitamin drops with iron. Vitamin drops contain 10 mg of elemental iron per dropper, which is the RDA for children six months to six years of age. 26, 27 Iron supplementation via drops or iron-fortified cereal should be continued throughout the period of breastfeeding. Breastfed preterm and low-birth-weight infants require supplementation at a dosage of 2 mg of oral elemental iron per kg per day, starting at two to four weeks of age.

26 Infants weighing less than 1, 500 g need higher dosages. 12 All supplemental iron preparations, especially those for adults, should be stored out of the reach of children to prevent fatal poisonings. Infants started on formula at birth and those switched from breast milk to formula should receive iron-fortified formula. 28 Term and preterm infants who are fed iron-fortified formulas are able to maintain iron sufficiency without additional iron supplementation. 26, 29 Vitamins given to these infants should not contain iron. TREATMENT After a positive screening test for iron deficiency and a diagnosis confirmed by a therapeutic trial of iron, the infant or toddler should complete a course of iron therapy.

Elemental iron, at a dosage of 3 mg per kg, is given orally once daily before breakfast. 21, 26 Absorption is improved if it is ingested with a source of vitamin C, such as orange juice. Total length of treatment is three months, including the one-month therapeutic trial of iron. 26.

### The role of meat to improve the critical iron balance during weaning [^2a7b97fd]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Iron requirements during the weaning period are the highest per unit body weight during human life, and diet is often insufficient to cover iron needs. For the first time in infant nutrition the absorption of both nonheme and heme iron from a typical weaning gruel after addition of meat with and without ascorbic acid (AA) to improve bioavailability was studied.

Methods

Nonheme and heme iron absorption from gruel was measured in 33 adults using 2 radioiron isotopes--an inorganic iron salt to label nonheme iron, the other biosynthetically labeled rabbit hemoglobin to label heme iron. Iron absorption was measured from the basal gruel (based on milkpowder and cereals) and from basal gruel added 20 g red powdered meat, alone and together with 20 mg AA in 4 different trials.

Results

Nonheme iron absorption from the basal meal was 0.33 mg/1000 kcal and the increase from added 20 mg AA was 39%, whereas addition of red meat increased nonheme iron absorption by 85%. This latter increase was unexpectedly high. Total iron absorption was further increased by heme iron absorption of 0.23 mg Fe/1000 kcal. When adding both meat and AA, total iron absorption amounted to 1.08 mg iron/1000 kcal, ie, exceeding 1 mg/1000 kcal, a level estimated to correspond with daily iron requirements in 95% of infants aged 12 months.

Conclusions

Addition of powdered red meat to weaning gruels markedly increased total iron absorption. A weaning diet with added powdered meat and AA may serve as a viable option to satisfy the body's high iron requirements during this critical period.

### Vegan diet and nutritional status in infants, children and adolescents: a position paper based on a systematic search by the ESPGHAN nutrition committee [^5c7cbf60]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Nutritional adequacy

Children on a vegan diet should have regular nutritional counselling from a qualified paediatric dietitian. In settings where dietary support is not available, a public health approach should be adopted to provide clear advice based on evidence‐based research and clinical observation.
Vegan diets in infants, children and adolescents should provide the same age‐appropriate average requirements for energy intake as for the general paediatric population.
Vegan children may need to consume more protein than recommended for the general population in view of the lower digestibility of plant protein compared to animal protein.
The protein intake should be assessed on an individual basis for each child. The quality as well as the quantity of protein should be taken into account to optimise essential amino acid intake.
Foods rich in ALA should be consumed regularly to support adequate omega‐3 fatty acid ingestion. An algal‐based, age‐appropriate DHA supplement with titrated content might be considered in children aged <2 years.
Nutritional advice should emphasise the intake of iron‐rich foods and nutrients such as vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption in view of the lower bioavailability of plant‐derived iron sources. Families should also be aware that nutrients such as phytates, polyphenols, calcium and oxalic acid inhibit iron absorption.
Iron supplements should be considered in breastfed infants from 6 months and in older children if inadequate nutritional intake.
To guarantee adequate calcium intake when introducing complementary feeding, breastfeeding and/or infant formula should be continued for 12 months or longer until the infant is on a nutritionally complete diet. Nutritional counselling should target calcium‐rich foods, e.g. calcium‐supplemented foods/fluids, and calcium supplements, where needed.
Vegan children should aim to include vitamin B12 fortified foods in their diets, and a daily age‐appropriate vitamin B12 supplement is recommended (see Table S2).
Consider an age‐appropriate vitamin D supplement (see Table S3) since a vegan diet is considered a risk factor for deficiency from birth to 18 years.
In the same way as in the general population, Vitamin D supplements are even more important when there is a lack of skin (arms and face) exposure to sun, in more Northern countries, and/or an indoor lifestyle.
If dietary calcium intake is insufficient, children benefit from a vitamin D and calcium supplement.

### Does the fortified milk with high iron dose improve the neurodevelopment of healthy infants? Randomized controlled trial [^36ebf550]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional status of children took into account both anthropometry and biochemistry from birth. We assessed iron status with a wide battery of measures. It should be borne in mind that there are no clear normality criteria on the biochemical parameters of iron status in children. The international organizations recommend having observed the combination of two or three altered parameters to determine ID and IDA. However, serum ferritin is a very specific marker, the levels of which only diminish if iron stores are depleted.

It is well documented that SF physiologically declines throughout the first year of life. In our population, although this decrease is evident in both intervention groups from 6 to 12 months of age, it was less abrupt in children supplemented with 1.2 mg/100 mL than in those who received 0.4 mg/100 mL of iron. Similarly, even though several authors in European countries observed higher levels of SF after the intervention with iron –, our results suggest that supplementation with iron doses within the dietary recommendations in healthy, well–fed children from a developed country improved their iron status, but it was not enough to replete the iron stores of children at 1 year of age. We also proposed the hypothesis, as some authors did previously, that the physical development of children was conditioned by iron, given its implication in several physiological processes. In this case, contrary to what was hypothesized, our intervention had no effect on children’s anthropometry, which reinforce some other findings. Recent reviews highlight that the knowledge about the effect of iron in the growth of children is still scarce and unclear. Beyond, the risk of infections following the iron fortification is a concern, keeping in mind that iron is an essential nutrient for the metabolism of some bacteria. About that, previous findings were in conflict but our results showed that the rate of infection was not significantly higher in the children fed with high–Fe milk than in those with low–Fe at 12 months.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017-2020 [^447052dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron plays an important role in many biological functions. Absolute iron deficiency results from a severe reduction or absence of iron stores. Functional iron deficiency occurs in the presence of adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability (thus, it is not a true deficiency of body stores). Although most research has focused on adverse outcomes among people with iron deficiency and anemia, iron deficiency affects nonerythropoietic tissue, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, in the absence of anemia. Iron deficiency has been associated with restless leg syndrome, decreased physical capacity, impaired neurocognitive function, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and other adverse outcomes independent of anemia.

Infants and children, people of childbearing potential, and people with certain conditions, such as anemia, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, have high rates of iron deficiency., The prevalence of iron deficiency outside these groups and the potential underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, the prevalence of functional iron deficiency has not been determined. Iron deficiency can be prevented or treated through dietary interventions or nonprescription iron supplements, but the current use of nonprescription iron supplements and dietary iron intake and iron deficiency prevalence have not been studied. These estimates are needed to identify populations at risk of iron deficiency–related adverse outcomes, inform screening recommendations, and establish research priorities. We estimated the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency and iron supplement use in the US from 2017 to 2020 across age, sex, and comorbidity categories.

### Health outcomes associated with micronutrient-fortified complementary foods in infants and young children aged 6-23 months: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f8b35335]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Complementary feeding is the transition from exclusive breastfeeding to family foods, typically from 6 months to 23 months of age.This period is crucial for physical, cognitive, and motor development, and during this time infants and young children need a great dietary diversity to ensure their nutrient needs are met.

The low mineral content of breast milk, the relatively small amount of complementary foods consumed, their potentially inadequate nutrient density, low consumption of haem iron-containing meat, and the relatively high requirement of micronutrients can lead to nutrient deficiencies during this period of growth.Micronutrient deficiencies are common in low-income and middle-income countries, affecting more than 2 billion people worldwide.The highest nutrient gaps in the complementary feeding period have been described for iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, zinc, and calcium.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Fortified complementary foods are processed foods enriched with essential micronutrients, with the aim of preventing or correcting deficiency of one or more micronutrients in the critical period of complementary feeding. They provide an alternative to home or point-of-use fortification with micronutrient powders or crushable or soluble micronutrient tablets, which were shown in recent systematic reviews to be effective tools to reduce anaemia in children in the complementary feeding period in low-income and middle-income countries. We did a preliminary search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the health impact of fortified complementary foods in infants and young children aged 6–23 months using the search terms “fortified” OR “fortification” AND “complementary” published up to Jan 15, 2021. No language restriction was applied. The preliminary investigation revealed systematic reviews assessing the effects of other existing nutritional strategies, including interventions with small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements, fortified milk, and home fortification with micronutrient powders. Some systematic reviews included a wide range of interventions, including industrially fortified foods. However, these reviews were narrow in terms of investigated outcomes and described studies from 2006 to 2014. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was done to address the existing gap and to inform the process of updating WHO guidance on feeding of infants and young children aged 6–23 months.

### Enteral iron supplementation in preterm and low birth weight infants [^cbf68048]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm infants are at risk of exhausting their body iron stores much earlier than healthy term newborns. It is widespread practice to give enteral iron supplementation to preterm and low birth weight infants to prevent iron deficiency anaemia. However, it is unclear whether supplementing preterm and low birth weight infants with iron improves growth and neurodevelopment. It is suspected that excess exogenous iron can contribute to oxidative injury in preterm babies, causing or exacerbating conditions such as necrotising enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity. Additionally, the optimal dose and timing of commencement and cessation of iron supplementation are uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of prophylactic enteral iron supplementation on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants. The secondary objectives were to determine whether iron supplementation results in improved haematological parameters and prevents other causes of morbidity and mortality.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1951 to August 2011), CINAHL (1982 to August 2011) and conference proceedings and previous reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials that compared enteral iron supplementation with no iron supplementation, or different regimens of enteral iron supplementation in preterm or low birth weight infants or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Both review authors separately evaluated trial quality and data extraction. We synthesised data using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs). Where data about the methodology and results or both were lacking, we made an attempt to contact the study authors for further information.

Main Results

We included twenty-six studies (2726 infants) in the analysis. The heterogeneity of participants, methods and results precluded an extensive quantitative synthesis. Of the 21 studies comparing iron supplementation with controls, none evaluated neurodevelopmental status as an outcome. Of thirteen studies reporting at least one growth parameter as an outcome, only one study of poor quality found a significant benefit of iron supplementation. Regarding haematological outcomes, no benefit for iron supplementation was demonstrated within the first 8.5 weeks of postnatal life (16 trials), except by two poor quality studies. After this age, most studies reported a higher mean haemoglobin in iron-supplemented infants. We were only able to include a limited number of studies in a quantitative meta-analysis, which suggested the haemoglobin concentration in iron-supplemented infants was higher by about 6 g/L at six to nine months. One study comparing high dose and low dose iron supplementation monitored neurodevelopmental outcome for one year, without finding any significant difference between the groups. One study comparing early versus late commencement of iron supplementation found no difference in cognitive outcome, but an increased rate of abnormal neurological examination in the late iron group at five years of age. The studies comparing high and low doses of iron indicated that there was no discernible haematological benefit in exceeding 'standard' doses of iron (i.e. 2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day).

Authors' Conclusions

The available data suggest that infants who receive iron supplementation have a slightly higher haemoglobin level, improved iron stores and a lower risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia when compared with those who are unsupplemented. However, it is unclear whether iron supplementation in preterm and low birth weight infants has long term benefits in terms of neurodevelopmental outcome and growth. The optimum timing and duration of iron supplementation remains unclear.

### Health outcomes associated with micronutrient-fortified complementary foods in infants and young children aged 6-23 months: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa02f7e4]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Some studies suggest that fetal iron deficiency might be detrimental to early neurodevelopment, but early iron supplementation in anaemic infants can have a positive effect on developmental scores (both cognitive and motor), regardless of a country's income status.Micronutrients as a sole intervention (ie, without an additional increase in macronutrient intake), however, seem to have no effect on growth.

Micronutrient deficiencies and their health consequences remain a global health problem, and several factors, including age of the target population, baseline anaemia status, malaria prevalence, and presence of other causes of infection or inflammation, need to be considered.Beside products from multinational companies, locally manufactured, lower-cost fortified complementary food products are available in low-income countries; however, access to these products is still far from optimal in several settings.WHO states: “To ensure their success and sustainability, especially in resource-poor countries, food fortification programmes should be implemented in concert with poverty reduction programmes and other agricultural, health, education and social intervention programmes that promote the consumption and utilization of adequate quantities of good quality nutritious foods among the nutritionally vulnerable.”

Several research gaps have to be further explored. As provision of iron in any product that is given to infants and young children raises questions of safety, potential adverse effects have to be further explored in both malaria-endemic and non-malaria-endemic settings. Studies should investigate whether consumption of fortified complementary foods has an effect on all-cause mortality. It would be important to know what level of fortification can lead to adequate or excess nutrient intakes, affect stunting or wasting, or influence vitamin and mineral status other than iron. Further studies are required to answer the question under what circumstances the provision of fortified complementary foods to infants and young children is able to affect mental and motor skill development. Microbiota composition has not yet been investigated at all. How the consumption of such foods affects the intake of other foods, diet diversity, or breastfeeding time—ie, whether and to what extent they displace other foods—should also be determined.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^cfbe7bdb]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)—screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic U.S. children ages 6 to 24 months provides: No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence). No studies assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify higher-risk children, and although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step; the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in young children, no recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available, and the USPSTF notes a separate recommendation for pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2f5c1cc9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation—net benefit assessment for screening and supplementation in pregnancy concludes that due to lack of available data, the current evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for both screening and iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined (I statement), and this recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.
