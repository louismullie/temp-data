## Question

Does that use IV contrast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a given imaging study uses intravenous (IV) contrast and how to determine that from the provided materials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which imaging modality is being discussed and whether contrast is typically used for that modality. Then, I should verify the route of contrast administration (IV versus oral, rectal, or intrathecal). Next, I will check for any explicit statements in guidelines or protocols that specify contrast use. After that, I need to consider exceptions and contraindications that might change the plan. Finally, I will synthesize a clear yes/no answer with supporting references and note any uncertainties that require clarification from the ordering clinician or the imaging protocol itself.

> Let me first confirm the imaging context. The documents repeatedly discuss IV contrast in the settings of CT, MRI, and ultrasound, indicating that "does that use IV contrast" is a common and clinically important question across these modalities, but the answer depends on the specific study ordered and the clinical indication rather than a universal rule [^116hMRGY] [^112gnBpd] [^111eLKWf].

> Wait, let me verify the route of administration before I jump to conclusions. Multiple sources explicitly distinguish intravenous contrast from oral, rectal, and intrathecal routes, confirming that "IV contrast" refers to agents injected into a vein rather than ingested or instilled by other routes, which is the key to answering the question accurately.

> I will now examine whether the provided materials directly state whether IV contrast is used for the study in question. Hold on, I should verify that the documents do not name a specific study type or protocol; indeed, they do not, so I cannot give a definitive yes/no without knowing the exact imaging order. However, they do provide clear exemplars: CT commonly uses IV iodinated contrast for vascular and visceral assessment, MRI frequently uses IV gadolinium-based contrast for tissue characterization, and ultrasound can use IV microbubble agents for perfusion or LV opacification, so the answer is "it depends on the ordered study" rather than a blanket statement [^116hMRGY] [^112gnBpd] [^111eLKWf].

> Let me consider the clinical scenarios that typically trigger IV contrast use to anchor the reasoning. For CT, IV contrast is standard for many emergency and elective evaluations of vascular structures, solid organs, infection, inflammation, and trauma, and is often essential for detecting active hemorrhage or vascular injuries; for MRI, IV gadolinium is routinely used for tumor staging, infection, and many neurologic indications; for ultrasound, IV microbubble contrast is used for myocardial perfusion, lesion characterization, and procedural guidance, which reinforces that IV contrast is common but indication-specific [^111kyjHb] [^111eLKWf].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions or contraindications that would change whether IV contrast is used. I need to check for renal function thresholds, prior contrast reactions, pregnancy considerations, and medication interactions like metformin, all of which can lead to non-contrast imaging or modified protocols; guidelines emphasize individualized risk–benefit assessment and note that many prior concerns about contrast nephrotoxicity have been revisited, with contemporary data suggesting minimal AKI risk from IV iodinated contrast in most patients, though caution remains in advanced CKD or specific high-risk contexts [^113uL1Hy] [^1134Nedv] [^112pyhCP] [^116k1A3M] [^116XhmwM].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any of the cited protocols mandate IV contrast universally. Some oncology and emergency protocols default to contrast-enhanced studies unless contraindicated, but even these typically allow non-contrast alternatives when clinically justified; for example, NCCN vaginal cancer guidance recommends MRI with and without IV contrast and CT with contrast unless contraindicated, and emergency appendicitis pathways allow CT with or without contrast, underscoring that contrast use is preferred when safe but not absolutely mandatory in all cases [^112gnBpd] [^111Tq8PJ].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Does that use IV contrast? I should confirm the exact study name and indication with the ordering clinician or the imaging protocol, because the answer hinges on the modality and the clinical question; in general, many CT, MRI, and ultrasound studies do use IV contrast when not contraindicated, but non-contrast alternatives exist and may be selected based on patient factors and diagnostic goals, so I cannot give a definitive yes/no without the specific study details [^116hMRGY] [^112gnBpd] [^111eLKWf].

It depends on the clinical question and patient factors. IV contrast is **used when diagnostic benefit outweighs risks** [^113uL1Hy] [^112pyhCP], especially for vascular, oncologic, infectious, or inflammatory indications [^1164GhwH] [^112gnBpd]. It is generally avoided or used with caution in patients with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, acute kidney injury, or prior severe contrast reaction, and in pregnancy. For low-risk patients, the risk of contrast-induced AKI is **very low** [^1164GhwH] [^1134Nedv], and prophylactic hydration is reserved for high-risk patients [^114R2XPf] [^1154TUaQ]. Always individualize decisions and follow institutional protocols [^1177AdDu].

---

## Clinical indications for IV contrast use

IV contrast is **indicated** in numerous clinical scenarios, including:

- **Vascular imaging**: Detection of aneurysms, dissections, occlusions, and active bleeding [^111kyjHb].

- **Oncologic imaging**: Characterization, staging, and treatment response assessment of tumors [^112gnBpd].

- **Infectious and inflammatory conditions**: Identification of abscesses, inflammatory lesions, and organ involvement [^111Tq8PJ].

- **Cardiac imaging**: Evaluation of coronary arteries, myocardial perfusion, and cardiac function [^111eLKWf].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While IV contrast is generally safe, certain conditions require caution or avoidance:

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or acute kidney injury (AKI) [^113uL1Hy] [^1177AdDu].

- **Severe contrast allergy**: History of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions [^114e3UWt].

- **Pregnancy**: Generally avoided unless absolutely necessary due to potential fetal risks.

- **Metformin use**: Temporarily discontinued peri-procedurally in patients with renal impairment to reduce risk of lactic acidosis [^114S7onT].

---

## Risks associated with IV contrast

IV contrast carries potential risks, including:

- **Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)**: Acute kidney injury occurring within 48–72 hours post-contrast, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, or dehydration [^113uL1Hy] [^113GHFyj].

- **Allergic reactions**: Ranging from mild urticaria to severe anaphylaxis, though rare with modern non-ionic agents [^114e3UWt].

- **Extravasation**: Local tissue injury due to contrast leakage, typically minor but occasionally severe [^114BLGQ4].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing contrast use

Several patient-specific factors influence the decision to use IV contrast:

| **Patient factor** | **Influence on contrast use** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | - Strong determinant <br/> - eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI increases CIN risk [^113uL1Hy] [^1151HRr9] |
| Age | Older patients have higher CIN risk due to reduced renal function [^114N73he] |
| Comorbidities | - Diabetes <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Multiple myeloma increase CIN risk [^113uL1Hy] [^112dh4sH] |
| Prior contrast reactions | History of severe reactions necessitates caution or avoidance [^114e3UWt] |
| Pregnancy | Generally avoided unless absolutely necessary |

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

When IV contrast is contraindicated or declined, **alternatives include**:

- **Non-contrast CT**: Useful for certain conditions (e.g. hemorrhage, fractures, lung nodules) [^117MWDyy].

- **MRI**: Gadolinium-based contrast agents are generally safer for renal function but carry risks such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in severe renal impairment [^112pyhCP].

- **Ultrasound**: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a promising alternative, particularly for liver and vascular imaging [^1113bX3q] [^116MLSC7].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Recent guidelines emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment** [^113ZJYcC]:

- **Risk stratification**: Assess renal function and patient-specific risk factors before contrast administration [^114gJe4q].

- **Hydration**: Prophylactic intravenous isotonic fluids recommended for high-risk patients (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI) [^114R2XPf] [^1154TUaQ].

- **Contrast agent selection**: Use low- or iso-osmolar non-ionic agents to minimize nephrotoxicity [^116k1A3M].

- **Monitoring**: Post-procedure renal function monitoring in high-risk patients [^1177AdDu].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Iv contrast use** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| Routine CT/MRI with normal renal function | Yes | Standard protocols |
| eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI | Use with caution | - Hydration <br/> - Low/iso-osmolar agents <br/> - Monitor renal function [^114R2XPf] [^116k1A3M] |
| Severe contrast allergy | Avoid | Alternative imaging |
| Pregnancy | Avoid unless necessary | Alternative imaging |
| Emergency imaging | Yes | - Individualized risk–benefit assessment <br/> - Hydration if high risk [^113BZWCM] |

---

IV contrast is **used when diagnostic benefit outweighs risks**, with decisions individualized based on renal function, comorbidities, and clinical urgency. Modern agents and protocols have reduced risks, but caution remains in high-risk patients [^113uL1Hy] [^1134Nedv].

### Is intravenous contrast associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury? [^1164GhwH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Computed tomography (CT) is a common imaging modality used in the emergency department. Intravenous (i.v.) contrast can assist with visualization of pathology, particularly for inflammatory conditions and vascular structures. However, i.v. contrast has historically been associated with the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Clinical Question

Is i.v. contrast associated with an increased risk of AKI?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of i.v. contrast for CT and association with AKI, need for kidney replacement therapy, and mortality. These studies provide estimates of the potential association of AKI with use of i.v. contrast for CT.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, the use of i.v. contrast for CT imaging does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of AKI.

### The controversy of contrast-induced nephropathy with intravenous contrast: what is the risk? [^113uL1Hy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has long been observed in both experimental and clinical studies. However, recent observational studies have questioned the prevalence and severity of CIN following intravenous contrast exposure. Initial studies of acute kidney injury following intravenous contrast were limited by the absence of control groups or contained control groups that did not adjust for additional acute kidney injury risk factors, including prevalent chronic kidney disease, as well as accepted prophylactic strategies. More contemporary use of propensity score-adjusted models have attempted to minimize the risk for selection bias, although bias cannot be completely eliminated without a prospective randomized trial. Based on existing data, we recommend the following CIN risk classification: patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m² are at negligible risk for CIN, while patients with eGFRs < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² are at high risk for CIN. Patients with eGFRs between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m² are at an intermediate risk for CIN unless diabetes mellitus is present, which would further increase the risk. In all patients at any increased risk for CIN, the risk for CIN needs to be balanced by the risk of not performing an intravenous contrast-enhanced study.

### Intravenous imaging contrast media complications: the basics that every clinician needs to know [^115VWFZr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast is commonly used in noninvasive imaging procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography and can evaluate blood vessels and better characterize soft-tissue lesions. Although the incidence of adverse events after administration of contrast is low, it is important that clinicians and radiologists minimize risks and respond quickly and effectively when reactions occur. We will discuss a range of adverse events to iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents, including allergic-like reactions, nephrotoxicity, extravasation, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. We will review risk stratification for patients, as well as premedication and treatment of adverse events.

### Updated guidelines for intravenous contrast use for CT and MRI [^116hMRGY]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast material is used extensively for CT and MRI scans done in emergency departments (ED). Its use is essential to make many critical diagnoses in ED patients. While adverse reactions can occur, newer research has added to our knowledge of IV contrast media tolerance and safety leading to improved and more liberal guidelines for intravenous contrast use. The updated information described in this review article indicates how intravenous contrast can be used safely in more patients, more expeditiously and with fewer precautions than with prior guidelines. This review article explains the basis for the new recommendations for intravenous contrast material use and describes indicated precautions and preparations to avoid adverse reactions for iodinated agents used for CT and gadolinium agents for MRI.

### Intravenous contrast medium extravasation: systematic review and updated ESUR contrast media safety committee guidelines [^114BLGQ4]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Need For A Review

Guidelines for management and prevention of contrast media extravasation have not been updated recently. In view of emerging research and changing working practices, this review aims to inform update on the current guidelines.

Areas Covered

In this paper, we review the literature pertaining to the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk factors and treatments of contrast media extravasation. A suggested protocol and guidelines are recommended based upon the available literature.

Key Points

- Risk of extravasation is dependent on scanning technique and patient risk factors.
- Diagnosis is mostly clinical, and outcomes are mostly favourable.
- Referral to surgery should be based on clinical severity rather than extravasated volume.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^113vHxeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Implications within US health care for contrast-enhanced imaging and contrast-induced AKI are as follows: all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging procedures should be evaluated for risk of AKI, and screening can most appropriately be performed using standardized questionnaires; routine measurement of serum creatinine (SCr) in all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging is not recommended; the risks and benefits of contrast administration need to be carefully evaluated in patients at high risk of contrast-induced AKI, and the risk of contrast-induced AKI should not preclude the performance of needed diagnostic imaging and therapeutic procedures; iso-osmolar or selected low-osmolar contrast in the lowest possible dose should be used in high-risk patients; the only intervention consistently demonstrated to decrease risk is periprocedural intravenous volume administration using isotonic crystalloid, thus all patients at increased risk should receive periprocedural intravenous isotonic crystalloid, although the optimal rate of fluid administration is uncertain and whether bicarbonate is superior to saline remains unresolved; the benefit associated with NAC remains uncertain, and given its minimal risk and cost, we do not recommend against its use, although it should not be used in lieu of more effective interventions, particularly periprocedural administration of isotonic crystalloid.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^116nhT26]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

We included all the guidelines on ICM in patients with kidney disease. The guidelines were defined as documents that self-identified as a guideline, or a guidance document with recommendations including consensus, appropriateness criteria, manual, etc. We restricted the publication time from 01 January 2018 onwards to present the recent developments on this topic, and only guidelines written in English and Chinese were available. The following articles were excluded: (1) guidelines developed from the perspective of a medical specialty, in which contrast media were discussed as one of those risk factors for kidney injury; (2) guidelines on intra-arterial contrast media administration, because intra-arterial administration has unique considerations that do not apply to the intravenous route of administration; (3) a previous version of an updated guidelines or a guideline under development; (4) study protocols, primary studies, comments on guidelines, conference abstracts, or other not guidance documents; (5) duplications. The titles and abstracts of unique records were screened, and then their eligibility was confirmed by reading the full texts and supplementary materials. The supplementary materials included but were not limited to protocol, conflict of interest declaration, evidence summary, and dissemination materials. For the guidelines published on multiple journals, all available materials were evaluated as a whole. The search strategy and guideline selection process are presented in Supplementary Note S 3.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114KU3TS]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Contrast considerations for computed tomography (CT) imaging — key points state to use intravenous (IV) contrast when a visceral or vascular injury potentially exists, with risks including contrast extravasation, contrast allergy, and contrast nephropathy; contrast allergic reaction can be attenuated or prevented with steroid pre-treatment protocols, with multiple oral doses or IV steroid a minimum of 4 hours prior to contrast infusion most often prescribed; patients particularly susceptible to acute contrast nephropathy include those with a significantly compromised glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because of multiple comorbidities, marked dehydration, or known chronic kidney injury.

### Are intravenous injections of contrast media really less nephrotoxic than intra-arterial injections? [^1114GbHN]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We oppose the opinion that the intra-arterial administration of iodine-based contrast media (CM) appears to pose a greater risk of contrast medium-induced nephropathy (CIN) than intravenous administration since 1) in intra-arterial coronary procedures and most other intra-arterial angiographic examinations, CM injections are also intravenous relative to the kidneys, 2) there is a lack of comparative trials studying the risk of CIN between intra-arterial and intravenous procedures with matched risk factors and CM doses, 3) a bias selection of patients with fewer risk factors may explain the seemingly lower rate of CIN after CT in comparison with coronary interventions, 4) the rate of CIN following intra-arterial coronary procedures may also be exaggerated owing to other causes of acute kidney failure, such as haemodynamic instability and microembolisation, 5) roughly the same gram-iodine/GFR ratio (≈1:1) as a limit of relatively safe CM doses has preliminarily been found for both intravenous CT and intra-arterial coronary procedures and 6) the substantially higher injected intravenous CM dose rate during CT relative to an intra-arterial coronary procedure might actually pose a higher risk of CIN following CT.

Key Points

- Most intra-arterial injections of contrast media are intravenous relative to the kidneys.
- No evidence that intravenous CM injections should be less nephrotoxic than intra-arterial.
- Considerably higher dose rates of CM are used for CT relative to intra-arterial procedures.
- Higher dose rates may pose higher nephrotoxic risk for intravenous based CT studies.

### Contrast-induced acute kidney injury: pathophysiology, manifestations, prevention, and management [^117CvabF]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied throughout the years. There is a large volume of literature documenting this risk, and most radiology departments and radiologists use this information when making decisions regarding contrast administration. A review of the current information on the topic of contrast-induced acute kidney injury is necessary to ensure that the risks of intravenous contrast are properly weighed against the benefits of a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^1154TUaQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), also known as contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), is marked by a decline in renal function typically occurring 2 to 5 days after intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast material administration. This phenomenon primarily affects patients whose renal function is already compromised. It usually resolves spontaneously, leaving no lasting effects, but is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. No treatment for CIN/CI-AKI exists, therefore the focus lies on prevention.

Guidelines on the use of intravascular iodinated contrast material administration exist in most countries and are implemented in most hospitals. They generally recommend intravascular volume expansion with isotonic saline as standard prophylaxis for those considered at risk of CIN/CI-AKI. This recommendation has far-reaching consequences for patient, hospital, and health care budgets, because the peri-procedural prophylactic treatment requires hospitalisation for up to 24 h. Furthermore, the impact is substantial given the estimated > 75 million procedures with intravascular iodinated contrast material done worldwide annually.

### Scope of practice and clinical standards for the diagnostic medical sonographer [^114onvqA]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Standard — analysis and determination of protocol for the diagnostic examination or procedure — determination of the most appropriate protocol will optimize patient safety and comfort, diagnostic quality, and efficient use of resources; in accordance with written supervising physician or facility policies, procedures, protocols, or other requirements of the jurisdiction where performed, the sonographer integrates medical history, previous studies, and current symptoms in determining the appropriate diagnostic protocol and customizing the examination or procedure to the needs of the patient, uses professional judgment to adapt the protocol or consults appropriate healthcare providers, when necessary, to optimize examination or procedure images, findings, or results, follows facility protocol or consults with the supervising physician to determine if an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent or other pharmacologic agent may enhance image quality or obtain additional diagnostic information, and with appropriate education, training, demonstration of competence, and supervision, performs venipuncture, intravenous line insertion, and administration of intravenous fluid, ultrasound contrast agent, or other pharmacologic agent to enhance image quality or obtain additional diagnostic information.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^113ZJYcC]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To appraise the quality of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) use in patients with kidney disease, and to compare the recommendations among them.

Methods

We searched four literature databases, eight guideline libraries, and ten homepages of radiological societies to identify English and Chinese guidelines on intravenous ICM use in patients with kidney disease published between January 2018 and June 2023. The quality of the guidelines was assessed with the Scientific, Transparent, and Applicable Rankings (STAR) tool.

Results

Ten guidelines were included, with a median STAR score of 46.0 (range 28.5–61.5). The guidelines performed well in "Recommendations" domain (31/40, 78%), while poor in "Registry" (0/20, 0%) and "Protocol" domains (0/20, 0%). Nine guidelines recommended estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as the cutoff for referring patients to discuss the risk-benefit balance of ICM administration. Three guidelines further suggested that patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and high-risk factors also need referring. Variable recommendations were seen in the acceptable time interval between renal function test and ICM administration, and that between scan and repeated scan. Nine guidelines recommended to use iso-osmolar or low-osmolar ICM, while no consensus has been reached for the dosing of ICM. Nine guidelines supported hydration after ICM use, but their protocols varied. Drugs or blood purification therapy were not recommended as preventative means.

Conclusion

Guidelines on intravenous ICM use in patients with kidney disease have heterogeneous quality. The scientific societies may consider joint statements on controversial recommendations for variable timing and protocols.

Critical relevance statement

The heterogeneous quality of guidelines, and their controversial recommendations, leave gaps in workflow timing, dosing, and post-administration hydration protocols of contrast-enhanced CT scans for patients with kidney diseases, calling for more evidence to establish a safer and more practicable workflow.

Key points

- Guidelines concerning iodinated contrast media use in kidney disease patients vary.

- Controversy remains in workflow timing, contrast dosing, and post-administration hydration protocols.

- Investigations are encouraged to establish a safer iodinated contrast media use workflow.

### Iodinated contrast and nephropathy: does It exist and what is the actual evidence? [^1148Ps1D]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Iodinated contrast material (ICM) is a critical component for many radiologic examinations and procedures. However, ICM has often been withheld in the past out of concern for its potential nephrotoxicity and increased risk of morbidity and mortality, often at the expense of diagnostic accuracy and timely diagnosis. Evidence from controlled studies now suggest that most cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by ICM were instead due to contrast-independent causes of AKI or normal variation in renal function. This study will discuss current knowledge of contrast-induced AKI, including the incidence, sequelae, risk factors, and prevention strategies of this potential complication.

Module E — management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring iodinated contrast — provides an algorithm beginning with "Patient needing intravenous iodinated contrast (arterial or venous) for imaging (see Sidebar 10)" and the decision "Is the study urgent?". If "Yes", the pathway is "Proceed with contrast study" followed by "Perform post-procedure volume expansion if indicated". If "No", evaluate "Is the patient's eGFR above the threshold for safe IV or IA contrast administration (see table in footnote)?"; if "Yes", "Proceed with administration of contrast"; if "No", "Perform pre-procedure volume expansion if indicated (see table in footnote and Sidebar 10 for fluid regimens)" followed by "Perform post-procedure volume expansion if indicated".

### Canadian association of radiologists guidance on contrast-associated acute kidney injury [^1151HRr9]. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to restriction of contrast medium use, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to do not restrict repeat contrast doses in lower-risk patients (eGFR > 30, no AKI, IV route) and do not withhold repeat doses for emergency or inpatients with life-threatening or acute presentation of illness. Avoid repeated contrast exposures within 48 hours for elective procedures if the patient is at higher risk of contrast-associated AKI (eGFR ≤ 30, AKI, intra-arterial Iodinated contrast media administration).

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^111kyjHb]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Use of IV contrast for visceral or vascular injury — IV contrast is utilized in all situations having a potential for visceral or vascular injury; its use is critical for determination of active ongoing bleeding (contrast blush) and at-risk lesions such as pseudo-aneurysm or dissection; IV contrast greatly increases sensitivity of detecting solid organ injuries; arterial phase imaging in conjunction with venous phase acquisition facilitates differentiation between arterial and venous injuries that can impact treatment interventions.

### Use of radiopaque contrast agents for the interventional pain physician [^113WJ4v2]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast (IV) agents are used by Interventional Pain Management specialists for accurate localization of needle positions and spread of contrast agents to delineate pertinent anatomy. IV contrast agents are classified chemically as non-ionic or ionic monomers and dimers. Non-ionic IV contrast agents are more hydrophilic which makes them less neurotoxic. They also have a lower osmolality and produce fewer side effects. The desirable properties of IV contrast agents include satisfactory radiopacity, stability, pharmacological inertness and minimum sensitization. Physicians must obtain an informed consent for use of IV contrast agents prior to the procedure. A detailed history of allergies to iodine containing foods is a contraindication to using IV contrast agents. Reactions to IV contrast agents may produce mild to severe symptoms. Facilities where IV contrast agents are administered must be well equipped with resuscitation equipment, medications and available trained staff. Pretesting with a small intradermal dose or subcutaneous injections, will not predict adverse reactions. Premedication with antihistamines, anticholinergics and diazepam is less effective than with corticosteroids. Pretesting cannot be relied upon to predict severe reactions and may itself be hazardous for the patient. The frequency of renal insult is especially high with pre existing azotemia, diabetes mellitus or elevated serum creatinine. Patients over the age of 65 years, with multiple myeloma, hypertension or hyperuricemia are at increased risk for developing nephrotoxicity.

Purpose Of Review

The present review covers the European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for safe use of contrast media of importance for referring urologists.

Recent Findings

During the recent years contrast medium-induced nephropathy has become a hot topic. It is of importance to reduce its incidence. First of all, the patients at risk should be identified prior to the administration of a contrast medium, so that appropriate measures can be taken. Before intravenous administration of an iodinated agent but not before gadolinium-based and ultrasound agents, all patients should be questioned about the potential renal dysfunction at the time of referral, and only those who answer affirmative to at least one question should have their serum creatinine level determined. Before intraarterial injection, the serum creatinine should always be measured. In case of an abnormal level, another imaging procedure should be considered. If impossible, hydration should be instituted and administration of nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped. After administration, delayed reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, thyreotoxicosis, skin rash, etc. may be seen. Interaction with isotope studies and biochemical analysis occurs too.

Summary

The awareness regarding the potential adverse reactions due to contrast media and the necessary precautions to be taken are of utmost importance both for radiologists and referring physicians. This is the only way to reduce their incidence.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116qFTMK]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

IV contrast administration and vascular access — IV contrast is most frequently administered through a pressure injector for optimal diagnostic clarity; antecubital or large forearm venous injection sites are preferred to reduce risk of contrast extravasation, but exceptions can be made for patients with difficult access; when a large bore peripheral IV catheter cannot be obtained, a pressure rated central venous catheter designed to accommodate high-pressure injection is a safe alternative; a central 9 Fr venous catheter is commonly placed in such patients and can be used, although many currently available products are not yet pressure rated; the large diameter of such cannulas can accommodate high flow rates while generating very low pressures.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to intravenous and oral fluids, ESICM 2010 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic crystalloids for prophylactic volume expansion in patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
Consider administering isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution, especially for emergency procedures.

### Refining safe contrast limits for preventing acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention [^113YeBtV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast, approximately a quarter of patients fell into the modifiable‐risk category, where efforts to limit contrast volume may meaningfully reduce kidney injury risk. For this population, safe contrast limits can improve care quality across the PCI care continuum by helping with pre‐, post‐, and intraprocedural planning. Establishing a safe contrast limit before a procedure has been shown to decrease the rate of post‐PCI renal injury when incorporated in a pre‐PCI "time‐out". 33 Such a time‐out could help operators decide ahead of time whether they should use contrast‐sparing PCI methods if the safe contrast limit is particularly low. 15, 24 The safe contrast limit could also help guide management during procedures. An operator, for example, could decide during a PCI that the contrast use is approaching the safe limit and delay additional interventions. It may also similarly give confidence to an operator that he or she may continue a procedure and give additional contrast if the safe contrast limit has not been reached. Finally, in the postprocedure setting, there may be a role for guiding how aggressively to administer intravenous fluids or other such CA‐AKI prevention methods depending on the contrast usage relative to the safe contrast limit. We present a schematic (Figure 6) for how our new safe contrast limits might be implemented in a clinical setting. In this implementation model, the EHR automatically extracts patient risk factor data, calculates the contrast limit, and displays the contrast limit at the point of care.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^117MWDyy]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast nephropathy risk assessment for computed tomography (CT) imaging states that the overall risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) following IV contrast utilization is very low, ranging from 0 to 11 percent, and that improved sensitivity of the study will outweigh AKI risk in the majority of patients. Patients with a significantly compromised glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to multiple comorbidities, marked dehydration, or known chronic kidney injury are particularly susceptible; point-of-care creatinine assessment (iSTAT), when available, will rapidly estimate GFR in 2 minutes. Patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min are deemed at risk for AKI; options in these patients include performing the study initially without contrast or performing the study with the minimum acceptable volume contrast infusion necessary to obtain a diagnostic study. When initial non-contrast torso imaging is used, real-time interpretation concurrent with acquisition is a best practice, and the presence of mediastinal, intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid consistent with hemorrhage, in other words, Hounsfield units of 30 or more, and/or concern for visceral injury usually warrants utilization of IV contrast despite its risk.

### Radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^116W6buL]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pancreatic cancer, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for radiotherapy (image guidance), ASTRO 2019 guidelines recommend to administer IV contrast at CT simulation, if not contraindicated, in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with radiotherapy. Obtain multiphasic CT with a high contrast flow rate and ensure injection volume and patient-specific scan timing.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^113p74qt]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

2.3 Procedures

Procedures for obtaining data on: baseline characteristics, prophylactic hydration, contrast procedure, complications of intravenous hydration, primary endpoint (CIN/CI-AKI), one-month renal function, changes in use of medication, use of resources, and presence or absence of major adverse events up to one month post-contrast exposure are detailed elsewhere.

Prophylactic hydration protocols used for patients randomised to the standard prophylaxis group were according to the guidelines and prescribed by the treating physician:standard protocol intravenous 0.9% NaCl 3–4 mL/kg mL/min h, during 4 h before and 4 h after contrast administration; long protocol intravenous 0.9% NaCl 1 mL/kg mL/min h, during 12 h before and 12 h after contrast administration. When deemed necessary on medical grounds, the treating physician could deviate from standard hydration protocols. Drinking habits of participants were not influenced.

All patients received pre-warmed (37 °C) intravascular contrast material with 300 mg iodine mL/min mL (iopromide, Ultravist, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany), which is a non-ionic, monomeric, low-osmolar iodinated contrast medium. Contrast administration parameters were not interfered with. Our institution uses personalised parameters (P3T, Certegra, Bayer) for optimal contrast volume and flow rate determination.

One-year follow-up data were obtained by consulting the hospital electronic file, through contact with the participant, their GP, their local hospital, or their local laboratory. The following data were recorded: serum creatinine and eGFR, renal replacement therapy including dates of first and (where applicable) last treatments, and mortality, including date and primary cause.

### Contrast echocardiography: current status and future directions [^111eLKWf]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Contrast echocardiography is a family of ultrasound-based procedures, whereby acoustic enhancing agents, usually microbubbles, are administered by intravenous route and detected in order to improve diagnostic performance. This review describes: (1) the agents that have been designed for diagnostic imaging, (2) current clinical applications where either left ventricular opacification or microvascular perfusion imaging with myocardial contrast echocardiography have been demonstrated to provide incremental information to non-contrast echocardiography and (3) future diagnostic and therapeutic applications of contrast ultrasound that rely on unique compositional design of ultrasound-enhancing agents.

### Intravenous contrast medium extravasation: systematic review and updated ESUR contrast media safety committee guidelines [^113qcSSW]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review highlights the key up-to-date evidence pertaining to CMEX summarising the important risk factors and a systematic approach to management. Whilst this review has been all encompassing, there are some limitations. Heterogeneity of the studies included in the paper have made performing a meta-analysis tricky and often difficult to compare data across different types of studies. Most of the studies are retrospective and with rates of CMEX being generally low, there are inadequately statically powered studies. There have been technological changes in CT and MRI, especially with use of non-ionic CM, increased understanding of the risk factors and use of EDAs as well as systems which halt injection if problems are encountered during infusion, all of which inform update on the previous guidelines. However, there remain important areas where further research would be merited. There is no data available on patient experience of CMEX and this is an important impact to explore as the patient may refuse to have CM in the future. Long-term follow-up of patients after CMEX and prospective trials with CMEX interventions are also not well-researched. Important questions to ask are appropriate time interval when to re-scan after a CMEX, impact on workflow and cost implications.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European society for magnetic resonance in medicine and biology [^112fYq9b]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

For safety procedures regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) refer to ESUR-CMSC guidelines. Thinking beyond single-patient safety, the choice of intravenous injection of GBCA in radiology should also incorporate MRI cost-effectiveness, MRI access to the patient community, and impact on the environment. Multi-society joint statements and cooperative actions are recommended to increase awareness of the consequences of inefficient use of GBCA (evidence level: low — expert opinions and recommendations exist; in vitro research is available, but further investigation is necessary).
The use of GBCAs is justified only when appropriate or when it can potentially influence clinical decisions, based on the patient's history and pre-MRI clinical assessment (evidence level: moderate — several recommendations exist, but further research is necessary to increase confidence).
GBCA standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight for most applications of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol; 0.05 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadobenate dimeglumine, and 0.025 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadoxetate disodium. Dose optimization is recommended, as administering a lower-than-standard dose can still provide equally effective diagnostic information. Virtual contrast-enhancement with zero-dose is unlikely to reflect pharmacokinetic events (evidence level: moderate — further research is necessary and lowering the dose can still affect diagnostic yield under specific circumstances).
Next-generation GBCAs have been developed to show higher kinetic stability and higher T1 relaxivity when compared with standard macrocyclic GBCAs. The additional benefit of these features is that comparable diagnostic efficacy is obtained with a lower (0.05 mmol/kg for gadopiclenol and 0.04 mmol/kg for gadoquatrane) than the current standard dose (evidence level: moderate — results of controlled phase III clinical trials are available).

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^115Pbe8a]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

The AMACING trial was about guideline efficacy, not about the (risk of) CIN/CI-AKI. Whether CIN/CI-AKI is synonymous to renal damage and whether all renal damage is reflected in CIN/CI-AKI incidence cannot be answered from our data. However, the analyses were done amongst all patients, including any patients in whom CIN/CI-AKI may have gone undetected, and reflect efficacy of prophylaxis in reducing adverse post-contrast outcomes.

Earlier randomised controlled trials with a group randomised to receive no prophylaxis included patients with normal renal function, were done in the acute setting in specific specialties and specific procedures, and long-term outcomes were not reported. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first systematic report of long-term post contrast adverse outcomes in this elective population with chronic kidney disease, especially with a large group of patients randomised to receive no prophylaxis. The AMACING trial participants all have eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, old age, anaemia, nephrotoxic medication), are from miscellaneous specialties in the elective setting, and received either intravenous (52%) or intra-arterial (48%) iodinated contrast material. Furthermore, all elective procedures with either intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast material administration were screened for inclusion in this trial, and the results therefore reflect daily clinical practice in the elective setting.

### Iodinated contrast media and their adverse reactions [^115ArGou]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2008). Low credibility.

Cross-use of technology between nuclear medicine and radiology technologists is expanding. The growth of PET/CT and the increasing use of intravenous contrast agents during these procedures bring the nuclear medicine technologist into direct contact with these agents and their associated complications. A basic understanding of the occurrence, risk factors, clinical features, and management of these procedures is of increasing importance to the nuclear medicine technologist. After reading this article, the technologist will be able to list the factors that increase the risk of contrast reactions; understand ways to minimize the occurrence of contrast reactions; and develop a plan to identify, treat, and manage the reactions effectively.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for image-guided procedures [^116MLSC7]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) uses intravenously injected gas microbubbles as a pure blood pool contrast agent to demonstrate blood flow and tissue perfusion at a much higher sensitivity than color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound. CEUS has gained traction in abdominal diagnostic imaging for improved lesion detection and characterization and a complementary problem-solving tool to CT and MRI. In addition to its diagnostic applications, CEUS has also proven useful for pre-procedure planning, procedure guidance, and post-procedure evaluation. This review provides a practical overview and guides to the application of CEUS in percutaneous, ultrasound-guided, needle-driven procedures, focusing on 2 common procedures, which illustrate the many benefits of CEUS- core needle biopsy (CNB) and percutaneous hepatic lesion ablation.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy: identifying the risks, choosing the right agent, and reviewing effective prevention and management methods [^112VwNBt]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With the rise in the use of intravenous iodinated contrast media for both computed tomography scan and angiographic studies, there is a greater likelihood of complications. One of the most well-known adverse effects is contrast-induced media nephropathy, which is also called contrast-induced acute kidney injury. This is third most common cause of hospital acquired acute renal failure. It is associated with an increase in morbidity, mortality, and greater financial burden on healthcare system. Because of these factors, it is important for the radiologist to not only recognize risk factors, as well as the signs and symptoms, but also to know how to manage patients appropriately.

### Guidelines for the cardiac sonographer in the performance of contrast echocardiography: a focused update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^11544fHD]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Update on contrast administration policy and establishing intravenous access — establishing IV access remains one of the biggest obstacles to administering UCAs in clinical echocardiography laboratories; because UCAs are critical to improving detection, it is essential that sonographers work with hospital administrations to adopt a contrast program that promotes their use in technically difficult studies; the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) released new standards in August 2012, and the guidelines require all cardiac ultrasound systems to have instrument settings to enable the optimization of UCAs, recommend using UCAs for all studies with suboptimal image quality, and require a policy or process to enable alternative imaging for suboptimal studies; this update reemphasizes that the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) supports IV training for sonographers in hospital and clinic settings, and this training requires knowledge of aseptic technique, venous anatomy, appropriate sites of access, risks to patients, and hospital approval to perform the technique.

### FDG PET / CT: EANM procedure guidelines for tumour imaging: version 2.0 [^114vt1m9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Medium credibility.

FDG PET/CT pre-examination information and contrast-related precautions include collecting oncological history and relevant comorbidity, neurological or psychiatric presentations, and height and body weight, and recording serum glucose with date and time; weight must be measured directly prior to each FDG PET/CT. Medication history, prior imaging with dates and full reports (including DICOM when possible), and any examinations on the same day or in the 24–48 h prior should be evaluated and noted, and if possible the PET/CT examination should be avoided in that scheduling. For contrast use, document allergy; if an FDG PET/CT with intravenous CT contrast is strictly necessary the referring physician must indicate the premedication protocol, and creatinine and/or glomerular filtration should be evaluated when intravenous contrast is to be used, with prevention of nephrotoxicity initiated if renal function is suboptimal.

Results

The in-house protocol for safe use of iodinated contrast material was updated and implemented in the summer of 2017 at Maastricht UMC+, after which only patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² were eligible for standard prophylactic intravenous hydration.

From July 1, 2017, until July 1, 2018, a total of 1992 elective procedures with intravascular iodinated contrast material in patients formerly and currently eligible for prophylaxis were identified: 1808 procedures in patients formerly eligible for prophylaxis (with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors) and 184 procedures in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² currently eligible for prophylaxis (Fig. 1).

### FDG PET / CT: EANM procedure guidelines for tumour imaging: version 2.0 [^114L1n2Q]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Medium credibility.

FDG PET/CT acquisition and CT protocol options — attenuation and scatter correction use CT data and CT may be low-dose or diagnostic: In PET/CT studies attenuation correction and scatter correction are performed using the CT transmission data. A PET/CT examination can include different types of CT scan depending on the CT characteristics, the dose and the use (or not) of oral and/or intravenous contrast agents. Low-dose CT scan is performed only for attenuation correction and anatomical correlation of PET findings and is not intended a priori for dedicated radiological interpretation, whereas a diagnostic CT scan, with or without intravenous and/or oral contrast agents and commonly using higher X‑ray doses, should be performed according to applicable local or national protocols and guidelines. Coverage can be limited-area tumour imaging for a limited portion of the body or whole‑body or torso imaging combined with dedicated brain imaging from base of skull.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, restriction of contrast medium use, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to do not reduce the dose of IV contrast for CT examinations since that lowers parenchymal enhancement. Use the appropriate IV dose for high-quality CT in all patients.

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^1122HUn7]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Use of prediction models in clinical practice

Predictive models for contrast induced nephropathy have been available for clinical use for almost 10 years. However, uptake by cardiologists and radiologists has been low, judging by their omission from recent clinical practice guidelinesand survey studies. Even though prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy perform similarly to other popular prediction models (Framingham risk score, QRISK2) on the basis of the C statistic, several important differences have limited their use in clinical practice.

Firstly, these aforementioned models have been externally validated in multicenter studies. Secondly, many predictive models, including the Framingham risk score and QRISK 2, clearly outline how assignment to a risk category affects diagnostic or therapeutic decisions. Finally, electronic risk calculators exist for both the Framingham risk score and QRISK2. None of the predictive models for contrast induced nephropathy satisfies all three of these elements, and only the model in the study by Mehran and colleagues satisfies two of three elements, but with a median C statistic of 0.57 on external validation.

Another reason for the low clinical uptake of predictive models for contrast induced nephropathy is that they have focused exclusively on populations receiving intra-arterial contrast for coronary angiographic procedures. These procedures represent a small proportion of all contrast procedures, with contrast enhanced computer tomography (CT) scans being much more common. Indeed, the risk of contrast induced nephropathy associated with intravenous, contrast enhanced CT procedures is not rare, occurring in 11% of a low risk population.

In addition, the pathophysiological mechanism of contrast induced nephropathy related to contrast enhanced CT procedures could differ from that associated with coronary angiography procedures. For example, in intravenous procedures involving contrast enhanced CT, a large volume of intravenous contrast is often injected within 10 to 20 seconds compared with small intra-arterial injections of contrast occurring over minutes in coronary procedures. As such, predictive models for contrast induced nephropathy derived from patients undergoing coronary angiography might not be generalisable to individuals undergoing intravenous contrast enhanced CT procedures or CT angiography.

### FDG PET / CT: EANM procedure guidelines for tumour imaging: version 2.0 [^115ubbYW]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Medium credibility.

FDG PET/CT contrast and breathing considerations for CT components include that "Arterial phase CT acquisitions should be avoided" and "Deep inspiration diagnostic chest CT scans should not be used for attenuation correction"; for shallow breathers, the PET study "ideally should be combined with a low-dose CT scan obtained during tidal or shallow breathing or with a contrast-enhanced CT scan obtained during tidal or shallow breathing". A positive contrast agent "may minimally affect the CT attenuation map and, therefore, affects SUV quantification", and in studies "without the need for advanced quantification, intravenous contrast agent may be used directly… because the impact on visual image quality and interpretation is modest". For clinical protocols without SUV-based quantification, a diagnostic CT with intravenous contrast may be used for attenuation correction, although "it may alter SUV quantification (< 10% on average)". A "deep-inspiration thoracic CT scan with a 20 s delay from the beginning of contrast agent infusion" can be added for information but "is used neither for attenuation correction nor for PET/CT image fusion", instead assessing lung parenchyma with "thinner slices (2.5 mm)". Consistency is emphasized: "the same approach should be followed at all subsequent imaging time points".

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^113GHFyj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although these recommendations seem trivial, it is important to balance the potential risk of CIN against the potential gain of administering contrast in the clinical decision process.

Risk for CIN increases with decreasing pre-existing GFR. A CIN Consensus Working Panel agreed that CIN risk becomes clinically significant when the baseline SCr concentration is ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (≥ 115 mmol/L) in men and ≥ 1.0 mg/dL (≥ 88.4 mmol/L) in women, mostly equivalent to an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². In light of more recent work, the ERBP work group agrees with KDIGO that this threshold could be lowered to 45 mL/min/1.73 m².

The risk of CIN also increased in the presence of diabetes, and dehydration. The risk may be lower when simple i.v. contrast is administered for imaging versus when contrast is used during an invasive intra-arterial procedure, where the risk of cholesterol embolization should also be taken into account. It is unclear whether simple intra-arterial injection, e.g. digital subtraction angiography has a different risk from i.v.

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^115td89p]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Every year, over 80 million iodinated contrast studies are performed worldwide, ordered by a wide range of medical specialties. With the increasing trend towards minimally invasive diagnostic and interventional procedures that often need intravenous or intra-arterial contrast, there has been a concomitant rise in the incidence of acute kidney injury after exposure to radiocontrast, often termed contrast induced nephropathy. In fact, contrast induced nephropathy could be as high as the third most common cause of acute kidney injury in patients admitted to hospital, after ischaemic and drug induced injury.

Studies have shown a strong association between contrast induced nephropathy and adverse clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular complications, provision of dialysis, and death. Therefore, the use of prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy could have several benefits. Firstly, they may help identify patients at high risk for the disorder, who might benefit from peri-procedural strategies that protect the kidney. Secondly, patients identified as high risk would also be an ideal population to study novel therapies for the prevention and treatment of the disorder. Finally, prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy could improve preintervention counselling to facilitate informed patient centred decision making.

Despite these potential benefits, clinical prediction rules have several weaknesses that limit their application in daily practice. These include differences in derivation, inconsistent external validation, and complexity. Most importantly, the downstream effects of adopting clinical prediction rules to guide decision making and improve patient outcomes are often not evaluated. These factors make it challenging for a clinician to select the ideal model to use in practice. To address this knowledge gap, we did a systematic review to look at the available literature on validated prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy, and to describe their performance and clinical usefulness.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113BZWCM]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD guideline — contrast-enhanced imaging prophylaxis and decision-making recommends IV fluid strategies while avoiding delays in necessary imaging. Administration of IV volume expansion before and after contrast imaging is recommended for high-risk patients with CKD, and the Work Group recommended that patients at increased risk of CA-AKI receive volume expansion with IV isotonic crystalloid solutions prior to and following contrast administration. The risk of AKI associated with contrast exposure should not prevent the performance of medically necessary contrast-enhanced tomography; the guideline states that clinically indicated contrast-enhanced imaging should not be avoided solely on perceived risk of CA-AKI and that, in general, prophylactic IV fluid expansion is only required for individuals with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with prophylaxis also to be considered for individuals with an eGFR between 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² depending on other risk factors. Thus, the Work Group suggests that providers weigh the benefits of IV fluid volume expansion with the risks associated with delaying urgent or emergent imaging and procedures, and notes that providers should forgo IV fluid expansion rather than delay medically necessary imaging or procedures.

Patient summary

Current MRI contrast agents have an excellent safety profile. However, in some clinical contexts, the intravenous injection of a contrast agent does not add any information and could be avoided. The use of GBCAs must be justified in terms of benefit/risk ratio and optimized to the lowest dose achievable without losing diagnostic information. Next-generation contrast agents show promise to obtain comparable diagnostic efficacy and safety with lower doses.

### Spanish and english video-assisted informed consent for intravenous contrast administration in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^112xz3u2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

This study determined whether Spanish and English educational videos are superior to routine discussion for informing emergency department (ED) patients about risks, benefits, and alternatives to receiving intravenous contrast for computed tomography (CT).

Methods

A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed on a convenience sample of adult ED patients scheduled to receive intravenous contrast for CT. Patients randomized to the intervention group watched a video in Spanish or English explaining the procedure and its risks, benefits, and alternatives. The control group underwent routine discussion, receiving intravenous contrast information from their emergency physician. After their educational sessions, all participants completed a 10-question intravenous contrast knowledge measure and 1 question rating satisfaction with the informed consent process. Mean scores were compared to assess whether the videos were superior to routine discussion for educating patients about intravenous contrast. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of satisfied patients and refusals to sign consent.

Results

Of the 112 patients enrolled, 56 were randomized to the video group and 56 to routine discussion. Five patients withdrew from the study, leaving 107 for analysis (video N = 53; control N = 54). Mean knowledge scores were higher in the video group (68.1%) compared to routine discussion (47.8%) (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference 12.6% to 28.1%). Video-group patients exhibited greater satisfaction than routine-discussion patients (86.8% [95% CI 74.6% to 94.5%] versus 77.4% [95% CI 63.8% to 87.7%]). All patients signed consent to receive intravenous contrast.

Conclusion

Using Spanish and English educational videos yielded higher intravenous contrast knowledge scores compared with routine informed consent procedures.

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^116jkq2k]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study limitations

Our study had several limitations. Firstly, our included studies were heterogeneous in terms of their populations, use of prophylactic therapies, and definitions of contrast induced nephropathy, which could have led to a differential risk for contrast induced nephropathy. Secondly, our review focused only on studies in which contrast was administered for a coronary procedure; therefore, the risk models reviewed might not be generalisable to other procedures, such as intravenous contrast enhanced CT, CT angiography, and non-coronary angiography. However, no studies have derived a predictive score for contrast induced nephropathy in a population receiving intravenous contrast.

Thirdly, only one of the 12 models in our review included an analysis of reclassification using clinically meaningful risk categories. Because net reclassification is a relatively new construct, this may explain why it was not included during the validation of the models included in our review. Fourthly, the criteria for risk of bias and clinical usefulness were adapted from the existing literature on clinical risk prediction and have not been extensively studied or prospectively validated. However, this exercise is necessary because the inclusion of methodologically weak studies can threaten the internal validity of a systematic review. Finally, no internally or externally validated models were prospectively evaluated in clinical practice to determine their effect on clinical decision making and patient outcomes.

Clinical applications and future directions

Currently, there are no definitively effective strategies for prophylaxis or treatment of contrast induced nephropathy. The provision of intravenous fluids (containing saline or bicarbonate) and N-acetyl cysteine have been extensively studied for prophylaxis; however, no conclusion on efficacy has been reached despite multiple prospective trials and several meta-analyses. As a result, the Prevention of Serious Adverse Events following Angiography (PRESERVE) trial is underway, with the plan to enrol 8680 patients to compare the effectiveness of isotonic sodium bicarbonate versus isotonic saline and oral N-acetyl cysteine versus oral placebo (NCT01467466; GMC is on the steering committee of the PRESERVE trial).

Another effective prevention strategy for contrast induced nephropathy could be system based quality improvement efforts. Brown and colleagues reduced the rate of contrast induced nephropathy by 20% in consecutive patients with percutaneous coronary intervention at multiple centres through a multifaceted intervention. These improvements included standardised fluid orders, loosening nil per mouth restrictions before a procedure, cessation of nephrotoxic medications, self-expansion of the extracellular fluid volume, mandatory procedure delays to ensure adequate volume status, and team training.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy: contrast material not required? [^111VVuQa]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This commentary deals with the study by Newhouse and colleagues in this issue of the AJR discussing the implications of a lack of a control group in previously published studies on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

Conclusion

Until more rigorous studies including an appropriate control group address the issue of CIN, our understanding of the actual risk of CIN when administering IV contrast media is limited.

### When to order a contrast-enhanced CT [^116XhmwM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Family physicians often must determine the most appropriate diagnostic tests to order for their patients. It is essential to know the types of contrast agents, their risks, contraindications, and common clinical scenarios in which contrast-enhanced computed tomography is appropriate. Many types of contrast agents can be used in computed tomography: oral, intravenous, rectal, and intrathecal. The choice of contrast agent depends on route of administration, desired tissue differentiation, and suspected diagnosis. Possible contraindications for using intravenous contrast agents during computed tomography include a history of reactions to contrast agents, pregnancy, radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid disease, metformin use, and chronic or acutely worsening renal disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria is a useful online resource. Clear communication between the physician and radiologist is essential for obtaining the most appropriate study at the lowest cost and risk to the patient.

### Critical but commonly neglected factors that affect contrast medium administration in CT [^116QVYqs]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For decades, intravenous (IV) contrast media have been used to aid in diagnostic imaging of anatomical structures. In Computed Tomography (CT), the use of an iodinated contrast medium enables visualization of and differentiation between tissue types with similar densities, due to the x-ray absorption properties of iodine. While the absorption characteristics are favorable, the increased viscosity of iodinated contrast medium (which increases non-linearly with increasing concentration) makes hand injection or the use of traditional infusion pumps infeasible at the clinically relevant flow rates and volumes required. Therefore, the use of power injectors to administer contrast media is standard practice in CT. The standard setup includes an electromechanical pump, a protocol programming interface, a location to attach fluid sources, and plastic disposables (either syringes and/or tubing sets) designed to deliver the fluids from the source through the IV access device to the patient.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^111Tq8PJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Adult suspected appendicitis — computed tomography (CT) contrast use is addressed with recommendations and performance data. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations state that in adult patients undergoing a CT scan for suspected appendicitis, perform abdominal and pelvic CT scan with or without contrast (intravenous [IV], oral, or rectal), and the addition of IV and oral contrast may increase the sensitivity of the CT scan for the diagnosis of appendicitis; Level C recommendations: None specified. In the majority of studies, CT performs reasonably well regardless of whether or not contrast is used, and when compared, the improvement in diagnostic accuracy achieved by the addition of IV or enteric contrast is small. A systematic review reported weighted sensitivities and specificities as follows: noncontrast CT 93% and 98%, CT with oral and IV contrast 93% and 93%, and CT with rectal contrast 97% and 97%, concluding that oral contrast does not improve the accuracy of CT for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Contrast disadvantages noted include that oral contrast requires time to administer and to transit the bowel and may be difficult to tolerate, rectal contrast requires less time but may be uncomfortable and unpleasant, IV contrast may lead to serious allergic reactions and renal failure, and contrast adds to cost.

### Adverse reactions to intravenous iodinated contrast media: a primer for radiologists [^111BPziM]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to intravenous iodinated contrast media may be classified as general and organ-specific, such as contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. General adverse reactions may be subclassified into acute and delayed types. Acute general adverse reactions can range from transient minor reactions to life-threatening severe reactions. Non-ionic contrast media have lower risk of mild and moderate adverse reactions. However, the risk of fatal reactions is similar for ionic and non-ionic contrast media. Adequate preprocedure evaluation should be performed to identify predisposing risk factors. Prompt recognition and treatment of acute adverse reactions is crucial. Risk of contrast induced nephrotoxicity can be reduced by use of non-ionic contrast media, less volume of contrast, and adequate hydration. The radiologist can play a pivotal role by being aware of predisposing factors, clinical presentation, and management of adverse reactions to contrast media.

### Impact on clinical practice of updated guidelines on iodinated contrast material: CINART [^1115Aogo]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines on safe use of iodinated contrast material recommend intravenous prophylactic hydration to prevent post-contrast adverse (renal) effects. The AMACING (A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline) trial showed that standard prophylaxis was not effective in the majority of patients targeted by the guidelines, a result which was confirmed by 1-year follow-up data. Benefits of standard prophylactic intravenous hydration, such as a reduction in post-contrast acute kidney injury and/or long-term adverse effects, were not found. The main differences between randomised groups with and without prophylaxis were rates of complications after prophylaxis (5.5% vs 0.0%) and costs (€1455 vs €792). The latter difference was mainly due to the hospitalisation required for prophylaxis, which is also the main burden for patients and hospitals associated with prophylaxis.

Recently guidelines have been updated, and standard prophylaxis is no longer routinely recommended for patients like those who participated in the AMACING trial (i.e. with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors). The changes in the recommendations on standard prophylaxis for elective patients in the Dutch (The Radiological Society of The Netherlands, NVvR) and European (European Society of Urogenital Radiology, ESUR) guidelines are summarised in Table 1.

As the numbers of interventional procedures are rising exponentially, identification of those patients at risk for renal complications has become even more important. Renal complications have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality after interventions. Risk factors have been studied to help identify those patients at increased risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy. Hydration and medications have been studied as protective measures to decrease risk of renal complications. Preconditioning patients with intravenous hydration has been found to be the most helpful in circumventing postprocedural contrast-induced nephropathy.

### Contrast media safety-an update [^115mM1Zy]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The value of contrast agents has for long been documented by their common daily use in imaging departments worldwide. In principle, they should be injected and leave the body immediately after use in the same condition or undergo natural metabolism without making any harm to the patient. However, this is not the case. It is of utmost importance to reduce the prevalence to as close as possible to zero. This can be done by identifying the patients at risk before administration of contrast agents. For acute non-renal adverse reactions, it is also important to be prepared for treating them instantly. The current review is a short state of the art regarding adverse reactions to contrast agents.

Contrast agent use in interventional radiology — contrast‑induced nephropathy is cited as a major morbidity associated with intravascular radiographic contrast and is reported as the third most common cause of acute tubular necrosis in hospitalized patients; very few studies permit separation from post‑contrast acute kidney injury, and although some literature questions its existence, we treat it as real but rare and recommend exercising caution in patients with preexisting renal disease. For intravascular angiography, physicians may elect to use a hypo‑osmolar agent such as iopamidol or an iso‑osmolar agent such as iodixanol owing to less harmful renal effects compared with hyperosmolar agents.

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^114N73he]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review demonstrates that risk prediction for contrast induced nephropathy is still in its early stages. Although higher performing models usually include pre-existing chronic kidney disease, age, diabetes, heart failure or impaired ejection fraction, and hypotension or shock, most have limited predictive ability when validated externally and are not relevant to individuals receiving intravenous contrast or non-coronary angiography. Given the increasing incidence of contrast induced nephropathy and the many clinical applications of risk prediction, it is necessary to build on current models to develop a clinically useful and generalisable prediction model for the disorder that can improve clinical decision making and patient outcomes.

### Adverse reactions to contrast material: recognition, prevention, and treatment [^112Jeeua]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to contrast agents range from a mild inconvenience, such as itching associated with hives, to a life-threatening emergency. Renal toxicity is a well known adverse reaction associated with the use of intravenous contrast material. Other forms of adverse reactions include delayed allergic reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and local tissue damage. Previous allergic reactions to contrast material, asthma, and allergies are factors associated with an increased risk of developing an adverse reaction. Pretreatment of patients who have such risk factors with a corticosteroid and diphenhydramine decreases the chance of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, renal failure, or a possible life-threatening emergency. Awareness of the different types of risk factors and prescreening for their presence allows for early recognition and prompt treatment. Prophylactic treatment before administration of contrast material can prevent potential adverse reactions. If such reactions do occur, prompt recognition allows them to be treated immediately. Using the smallest amount of contrast material possible and low-molecular, nonionic agents also decreases the relative risk of reactions. Renal insufficiency induced by contrast material may be prevented by ensuring adequate hydration and discontinuing other nephrotoxic medications before the procedure. Low-osmolar, nonionic agents are helpful in patients with known conditions associated with adverse reactions.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114e3UWt]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast allergy — risk factors and pre-treatment notes that severe anaphylactic reactions with modern non-ionic agents are rare, with severe reactions occurring in 0.04 to 0.22 percent of studies performed, and Visipaque® is reported to be the least allergenic formulation. Seafood allergy and atopic tendencies are not direct risk factors for anaphylaxis associated with non-ionic contrast, whereas a history of previous contrast allergy confers the highest risk but is not an absolute contraindication to IV contrast. Steroid pre-treatment protocols can attenuate or prevent reactions, though evidence of effectiveness is not conclusive; most protocols prescribe multiple doses of oral or IV steroids a minimum of 4 hours prior to image acquisition and contrast infusion, and it is unlikely that pre-treatment administered at less than 4-hour intervals will be effective. Because such protocols may delay diagnosis, consider unenhanced CT to look for fluid, air, and fractures when risk for further delay to definitive study with IV contrast is deemed prohibitive.

VA/DoD CKD CPG — prophylactic IV isotonic crystalloid around contrast exposure — reports that the Work Group suggests that IV isotonic crystalloid be administered to reduce the risk of CA-AKI in high-risk patients unless IV fluid administration is contraindicated or would delay emergency imaging or procedures; the strength of evidence supporting the use of isotonic crystalloid to mitigate the risk for development of CA-AKI in high-risk patients is strong based on studies demonstrating greater risk reduction associated with higher volumes of administered isotonic fluids; for more urgent studies, patients can be given at least 3 mL/kg of isotonic saline one hour pre-procedure continued at a rate of 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour during the procedure, and at least an additional 6 mL/kg of isotonic saline over 2–6 hours at a rate of 1–3 mL/kg/hour post-procedure; for routine studies in hospitalized patients, the Work Group suggests the administration of isotonic saline at 1 mL/kg/hour for at least 6–12 hours pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and for at least 6–12 hours post-procedure, and these suggestions assume that an assessment of volume status has been done and that patients are reasonably able to tolerate this amount of fluid.

### Strategies for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury [^116eEpCP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media for diagnostic imaging is a common cause of acute kidney injury and a leading cause of iatrogenic renal disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the principal risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury and to summarize recent data describing the efficacy of various preventive interventions for this condition.

Recent Findings

Whereas earlier studies suggested that certain low-osmolal contrast agents including iohexol and ioxaglate are more nephrotoxic than iso-osmolal iodixanol, recent clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing other low-osmolal contrast agents with iodixanol have found little difference in risk. The provision of prophylactic renal replacement therapy does not ameliorate the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, and likely poses undue risk. Despite some research supporting a benefit of atrial natriuretic peptide, statins, and prostaglandin analogs, additional data from large, adequately powered studies are needed before these agents can be recommended. N-Acetylcysteine and isotonic intravenous bicarbonate have been investigated intensely, yet the data on these interventions are conflicting due to methodological limitations in past studies.

Summary

Prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury involves the identification of high-risk patients, consideration of alternative imaging procedures that do not involve the administration of iodinated contrast, and integration of the cumulative data available on preventive interventions in high-risk patients.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) risk reduction during PCI — Patients with baseline renal insufficiency (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and/or elevated risk scores are at increased risk of developing CIN. The only strategies consistently shown to reduce the risk of CIN are hydration and minimizing the contrast dose, and pre-procedural intra-venous hydration can mitigate the risk and should be used routinely for patients at increased risk for CKD if not contraindicated. Administration of N-acetylcysteine does not offer a significant benefit and is no longer recommended. The total contrast dose should be monitored and risk scores can help identify a suggested limit; one tool uses the ratio of contrast volume to creatinine clearance (CrCl), with a ratio of contrast volume/CrCl > 3.7 as predictive of renal injury. For those with compromised renal function, recording the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and using it to guide fluid administration during the procedure should be considered, and optimal use of intravascular imaging may reduce contrast dose and is a developing strategy.

CT protocols for the FDG PET/CT study

CT imaging within the framework of FDG PET/CT studies typically consists of a topogram and a single or multiple helical CT scans.
CT acquisition parameters (e.g. tube current, voltage, slice thickness, rotation time and pitch) should be chosen with regard to the objective of the CT examination (e.g. attenuation and scatter correction, colocalisation of radiologically equivalent interpretation). Specific local or national dose limits may apply for these types of CT examinations and should always be adhered to. Overall, CT scan parameters should be chosen such that patient exposure is minimised yet dose is adequate to obtain the necessary diagnostic information.
Ultra low-dose CT scans are now being introduced on some PET/CT systems, often in combination with iterative reconstruction methods (as discussed below), which may be applied to further reduce CT radiation dose.
For a diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan, standard CT settings as suggested by related guidelines and the supervising radiologist or responsible physician should be employed. Modulation of the tube current is encouraged in the absence of metallic implants (e.g. orthopaedic braces) in the coaxial imaging range to lower patient exposure. Depending on the clinical question, intravenous and/or oral contrast agents may be employed. It might be appropriate to perform a diagnostic CT scan for particular regions of the body, followed by a low-dose CT scan of the rest of the body for CT attenuation correction and colocalisation. In some instances, it might be preferable to begin with a low-dose CT scan of the body and then decide to add a diagnostic CT scan of a particular region, as the findings on the low-dose CT scan may influence the need for a contrast-enhanced or higher resolution regional view.
High intravenous or intestinal concentrations of contrast agent may cause artefacts in the reconstructed PET images following CT attenuation correction and thus affect quantification. The impact of intravenous contrast agents on the accuracy of attenuation correction is considered acceptable when CT data are collected in the equilibrium or venous phase (i.e. delayed acquisition) and in some centres a contrast-enhanced CT scan only is performed, although uptake in reference regions such as the mediastinum and liver may be affected.
Arterial phase CT acquisitions should be avoided. In FDG PET/CT studies without the need for advanced quantification, intravenous contrast agents may be used directly (i.e. the CT scan can also be used for attenuation correction) during the FDG PET/CT study because the impact on visual image quality and interpretation is modest. However, deep inspiration for chest CT acquisition will cause a large degree of misregistration and may introduce unacceptable artefacts if the low-dose CT scan (with normal breathing) is replaced by such a diagnostic deep inspiration CT scan.
Deep inspiration chest CT scans should not be used for attenuation correction when PET quantification is required or intended. Therefore, for attenuation correction, the PET study ideally should be combined with a low-dose CT scan obtained during tidal or shallow breathing or with a contrast-enhanced CT scan obtained during tidal or shallow breathing (as described below).
The presence of a positive contrast agent (intravenous or oral) may minimally affect the CT attenuation map and, therefore, affects SUV quantification. If this were the only aspect to be taken into consideration, the ideal would be to prohibit CT contrast agent administration. However, in some clinical situations (depending upon tumour type, tumour behaviour or level of anatomical interest), the benefit of CT contrast agents may outweigh the small errors induced in SUV measurement, which may include increased SUV variability. Each protocol should specify the desired approach for the given study. Most importantly, in the same subject, the same approach should be followed at all subsequent imaging time points. In the case of longitudinal studies in which a diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan may not be indicated in all PET/CT examinations, strategies 1, 2a and 2b, as indicated below, should be followed.
If the FDG PET/CT study is performed with the purpose of quantitatively assessing FDG uptake and a diagnostic CT scan is required, the following PET and CT acquisition sequences or strategies should be followed, as indicated in the UPICT Oncology FDG PET/CT protocol and the FDG PET/CT QIBA profile: Strategy 1: When CT is used for attenuation correction and localisation only (not intended as a clinically diagnostic CT scan): CT topogram, followed by Low-dose CT scan, followed by PET acquisition Strategy 2: When a contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scan is also needed, one of the following options must be used: Strategy 2a (recommended as it avoids any, albeit possibly minimal, impact of intravenous contrast enhancement on attenuation correction and therefore SUV determination): Follow strategy 1 Acquire an additional intravenous contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scan with breathing instructions, if needed Strategy 2b: Perform an intravenous contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scan with breathing instruction if needed Follow strategy 1 with a delay of at least 60 s to allow contrast agent to dilute over the body/blood pool In the case of protocols or scanning strategies that can be used in clinical practice, i.e. when there is no need for or intention to perform SUV-based quantification, the diagnostic CT scan with intravenous contrast agent may be used for attenuation correction. If contrast-enhanced CT is used for attenuation correction it may alter SUV quantification (< 10% on average). Therefore, the strategies below are for image interpretation based on visual (uptake) assessment only. FDG PET/CT studies performed with the intention of assessing FDG uptake quantitatively should follow the recommendations given above (strategy 1, 2a or 2b). A deep-inspiration thoracic CT scan with a 20 s delay from the beginning of contrast agent infusion can be included as it will provide additional information. However, this CT scan is used neither for attenuation correction nor for PET/CT image fusion, but rather to assess the lung parenchyma with thinner slices (2.5 mm), which is very useful for comparison with previous and/or future studies, and also allows evaluation of thoracic vessels. Strategy 3 (low-dose CT scan): CT topogram, followed by A deep-inspiration thoracic CT scan with a 20 s delay from the beginning of the contrast agent infusion (this CT scan is used neither for attenuation correction nor for PET/CT image fusion), followed by A whole-body low-dose CT scan (with shallow or tidal breathing) with a 45 s delay after the thoracic CT scan (equilibrium or venous phase) if the thoracic CT scan was performed or with a 60 s delay after the beginning of contrast agent infusion if the thoracic CT was not performed, followed by PET acquisition Strategy 4 (diagnostic CT scan): CT topogram, followed by A deep-inspiration thoracic CT scan with a 20 s delay from the beginning of contrast agent infusion (this CT scan is used neither for attenuation correction nor for PET/CT image fusion), followed by A whole-body diagnostic CT scan (with shallow breathing) with a 45 s delay after the thoracic CT scan (equilibrium or venous phase) if the thoracic CT scan was performed, or with a 60 s delay after the beginning of contrast agent infusion if the thoracic CT scan was not performed, followed by PET acquisition Other specific protocols can be applied depending on the tumour type and the clinical indication. Intravenous contrast agent is ideally administered with a programmable fluid injector at a speed of 2.5 ml/s for a catheter of 20G × 1.16″ if located in the elbow. If the catheter is placed in other locations, the diameter of the catheter and/or the speed of infusion and delay may need to be adjusted. Oral contrast agents allow better delineation of the gastrointestinal tract. A positive contrast agent (for example diluted barium) as well as a negative or water-based contrast agent (for example water or locust bean gum) can be used. High intraluminal concentrations of barium or iodinated contrast agents can cause an attenuation correction artefact in PET images, resulting in an overestimation of FDG accumulation at those sites. These artefacts can be avoided by using a negative contrast agent. However, administration of water only as a negative intraluminal contrast agent itself is associated with fast reabsorption and can cause increased nonspecific FDG accumulation in the bowel. If quantification of the FDG PET/CT studies is required, the use of diluted positive contrast agents only is recommended. The concentration of diluted positive contrast agents should be low enough to guarantee absence of attenuation correction artefacts, and this should be verified for each combination of PET/CT system, PET/CT image reconstruction software and contrast agent being used. It should be ensured that the patient is lying within the CT-AC FOV and in the same position as during the PET acquisition. If the system is equipped with extended FOV capabilities this option should preferably be used to avoid CT truncation. Metal implants can cause severe artefacts in the CT image. Metal artefact reduction techniques may be used to minimise these artefacts. When the CT data are used for attenuation correction of the PET data, it should be considered that even when using metal artefact reduction techniques, metal implants will likely result in reduced PET image quality and will prevent proper quantification (at and near the metal implant). FDG uptake should be confirmed by inspecting the PET images without attenuation correction.

Paediatric PC-AKI

There are very few studies on paediatric PC-AKI. As the incidence of PC-AKI seems similar in children and adolescents to that in adults, the CMSC considers that for optimal safety the recommendations for sCr determination and prevention of PC-AKI, which are predominantly based on studies in adults (aged 18+ years), should also be used for children and adolescents (Table 4).

QUESTION 4: What are the patient- and procedure-related risk factors for developing PC-AKI and which patient populations have a higher risk for developing PC-AKI?

Patient-related risk factors

Impaired renal function is the most important patient risk factor for PC-AKI. Many meta-analyses and systematic reviews of uncontrolled studies have identified a wealth of possible clinical risk factors for AKI in general such as old age, female gender, low BMI, classic cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, malignancy, inflammation, bleeding, anaemia and hyperuricaemia. However, uncontrolled studies cannot reliably differentiate baseline clinical risk factors from effects attributable specifically to CM. In a meta-analysis of controlled studies, no additional risk factors specific for CM were demonstrated (Table 4). The effect of two or more risk factors is additive and increases the risk of PC-AKI.

Procedure-related risk factors: CM type and dose

A variety of risk factors have been related to the type of CM and the way it is administered.

Multiple meta-analyses have shown no evidence that iso-osmolar CM (IOCM) are associated with a significantly lower rate of PC-AKI than non-ionic, low osmolar CM agents (LOCM). However, the risk of PC-AKI is increased when ionic, high-osmolar CM are used. Repeated CM administration within a short interval (48–72 h) has been shown to increase the risk of PC-AKI (Table 4).

Evidence about the influence of CM dose (CM volume x CM concentration) indicates dependence on the route of administration. There is insufficient evidence that dose is a problem with IV CM. However, for direct IA CM administration in coronary angiographic intervention it is advisable to keep the ratio of CM dose (in grams Iodine) to absolute eGFR (in ml/min; corrected for body surface area) below 1.1 or to keep the ratio of CM volume (in ml) to eGFR (in mL/min/1.73 m²) below 3.0 when using a CM concentration of 350 mgl/ml (Table 4).

### Radiographic contrast media and the kidney [^112pyhCP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

AKI is a potential complication of intravascular iodinated contrast exposure. Contrast-associated AKI, which typically manifests as small and transient decrements in kidney function that develop within several days of contrast administration, is associated with serious adverse outcomes, including progressive kidney dysfunction and death. However, a causal link between the small increases in serum creatinine that characteristically occur with contrast-associated AKI and serious adverse outcomes remains unproven. This is important given mounting evidence that clinically indicated, potentially lifesaving radiographic procedures are underutilized in patients with CKD. This has been hypothesized to be related to provider concern about precipitating contrast-associated AKI. Intravascular gadolinium-based contrast, an alternative to iodinated contrast that is administered with magnetic resonance imaging, has also been linked with potential serious adverse events, notably the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severe impairment in kidney function. Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit frequently have clinical indications for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that involve the intravascular administration of contrast media. Accordingly, critical care providers and others treating critically ill patients should possess a sound understanding of the risk factors for and incidence of such outcomes, the ability to perform evidence-based risk-benefit assessments regarding intravascular contrast administration, and knowledge of empirical data on the prevention of these iatrogenic complications.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114mzS29]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — definition, staging, screening, and risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): The first recommendation is that contrast-induced AKI be defined and staged using the KDIGO definition and staging criteria, while noting that most clinical studies have used thresholds including increments in serum creatinine level of ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% relative to baseline and/or an absolute change in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 2–5 days following iodinated contrast media. The applicability of the urine output criteria to the diagnosis and staging for this form of AKI is uncertain and most episodes of contrast-induced AKI are nonoliguric. For pre-procedure risk identification, measuring serum creatinine prior to all contrast-enhanced procedures is neither practical nor feasible; simple questionnaires have been shown to be effective for identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal underlying renal function, and in patients without a recent serum creatinine measurement it is reasonable to use such questionnaires to identify patients who should have serum creatinine measured prior to contrast administration. Additional risk factors to recognize include diabetes in the setting of renal impairment, heart failure, repeated contrast exposure over short periods, and concomitant nephrotoxin administration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides).

### Bench-to-bedside review: preventive measures for contrast-induced nephropathy in critically ill patients [^112dh4sH]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

An increasing number of diagnostic imaging procedures requires the use of intravenous radiographic contrast agents, which has led to a parallel increase in the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy. Risk factors for development of contrast-induced nephropathy include pre-existing renal dysfunction (especially diabetic nephropathy and multiple myeloma-associated nephropathy), dehydration, congestive heart failure and use of concurrent nephrotoxic medication (including aminoglycosides and amphotericin B). Because contrast-induced nephropathy accounts for a significant increase in hospital-acquired renal failure, several strategies to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy are currently advocated, including use of alternative imaging techniques (for which contrast media are not needed), use of (the lowest possible amount of) iso-osmolar or low-osmolar contrast agents (instead of high-osmolar contrast agents), hyperhydration and forced diuresis. Administration of N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, or fenoldopam, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and periprocedural haemofiltration/haemodialysis have been investigated as preventive measures in recent years. This review addresses the literature on these newer strategies. Since only one (nonrandomized) study has been performed in intensive care unit patients, at present it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about preventive measures for contrast-induced nephropathy in the critically ill. Further studies are needed to determine the true role of these preventive measures in this group of patients who are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. Based on the available evidence, we advise administration of N-acetylcysteine, preferentially orally, or theophylline intravenously, next to hydration with bicarbonate solutions.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of prophylaxis use with intravenous contrast exposure to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy [^117V9FRK]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Iodinated radiographic contrast media has been associated with an acute deterioration in renal function, termed contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). This review aims to establish the efficacy of prophylaxis interventions used in adult patients prior to intravenous exposure to iodinated contrast to reduce the risk of CIN.

Methods

An electronic search for published peer-reviewed articles was performed, supplemented with manual review of references from previous systematic reviews and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Random-effect meta-analyses were used to assess CIN incidence, need for kidney replacement therapy (KRT), mortality, fluid overload and persistent kidney dysfunction.

Results

22 studies assessing a range of interventions were included in the qualitative analysis. The incidence of CIN was reduced by the use of N-acetylcysteine compared to a control group of saline (risk difference = -0.07, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01) but not by sodium bicarbonate compared to control group of saline (risk difference = -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01). Published studies give no indication that prophylactic interventions have significant impact on the need for KRT, mortality or persistent renal impairment.

Conclusion

Evidence for prophylaxis against CIN in patients receiving intravenous iodinated contrast is limited. There was an association with the use of NAC with reduced incidence of CIN following intravenous contrast but there was no impact on other clinical outcomes assessed. The clinical significance of these findings remains unclear and further research focusing on these clinical outcomes is required.

### Effect of intravenous contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis on detection of urgent and non-urgent pathology: can repeat CT within 72 hours be avoided? [^113QejP2]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine if administering IV contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis improves detection of urgent and clinically important non-urgent pathology in patients with urgent clinical symptoms compared to patients not receiving IV contrast, and in turn to determine whether repeat CT exams on the same patient within 72 h were of low diagnostic benefit if the first CT was performed with IV contrast.

Methods

We evaluated 400 consecutive patients who had CT abdomen and pelvis (CT AP) examinations repeated within 72 h. For each patient, demographic data, reason for examination, examination time stamps, and examination technique were documented. CT AP radiology reports were reviewed and both urgent and non-urgent pathology was extracted.

Results

Of 400 patients, 63% had their initial CT AP without contrast. Administration of IV contrast for the first CT AP was associated with increased detection of urgent findings compared with non-contrast CT (p = 0.004) and a contrast-enhanced CT AP following an initial non-contrast CT AP examination better characterized both urgent (p = 0.002) and non-urgent findings (p < 0.001). Adherence to ACR appropriateness criteria for IV contrast administration was associated with increased detection of urgent pathology on the first CT (p = 0.02), and the second CT was more likely to be performed with IV contrast if recommended by the radiologist reading the first CT (p = 0.0006).

Conclusion

In the absence of contraindications, encouraging urgent care physicians to preferentially order IV contrast-enhanced CT AP examinations in adherence with ACR appropriateness criteria may increase detection of urgent pathology and avoid short-term repeat CT AP.

### Immediate complications of intravenous contrast for computed tomography imaging in the outpatient setting are rare [^111s8Nck]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite increasing attention to the long-term risks of radiation exposure and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), institutional guidelines and patient consent procedures for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) imaging in the emergency department (ED) setting have focused primarily on more immediate complications, directly attributable to the administration of intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast administration. Thus, this study sought to define the risk of these immediate complications with the overall aim of improving institutional guidelines and patient consent procedures.

Methods

This was a prospective, consecutive cohort study of patients undergoing CECT of any body region in the ED, for complications occurring within 1 week of contrast administration, using predefined implicit definitions. Severe complications were defined as any of the following requiring medical or surgical intervention: bronchospasm with acute respiratory failure, airway obstruction, anaphylactoid shock, or acute pulmonary edema. The development of compartment syndrome, lactic acidosis, or pulmonary edema within 1 week of contrast administration was also considered a severe complication.

Results

Of 633 patients, only five (0.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3% to 1.8%) reported any immediate complications, all of which were classified as minor. No patient developed a reaction meeting the study definition of a severe complication.

Conclusions

The frequency of severe, immediate complications from CECT imaging that includes IV contrast is less than 1%, and the frequency of mild complications is less than 2%. The authors conclude that CECT is associated with a very low rate of severe immediate complications.

### FDG PET / CT: EANM procedure guidelines for tumour imaging: version 2.0 [^113ja1W2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Medium credibility.

CT protocols for the FDG PET/CT study — acquisition settings and diagnostic CT use: CT imaging within FDG PET/CT studies typically consists of a topogram and a single or multiple helical CT scans. CT acquisition parameters (kVp and mA) should be optimized for the examination objective, local or national dose limits should be adhered to, and parameters chosen so that patient exposure is minimised yet dose is adequate to obtain the necessary diagnostic information. Ultra low-dose CT scans are now being introduced on some PET/CT systems, often with iterative reconstruction, to further reduce CT radiation dose. For diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT, standard CT settings should be employed; modulation of the tube current is encouraged when no metallic implants are present, and intravenous and/or oral contrast agents may be used. Depending on the clinical question, it might be appropriate to perform a diagnostic CT for particular regions followed by a low-dose CT for the rest of the body; in some instances it might be preferable to begin with a low-dose CT of the body and then decide to add a diagnostic CT of a particular region.

KDIGO recommendation statements — contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): Define and stage AKI after administration of intravascular contrast media as per Recommendations 2.1.1–2.1.2 (Not Graded), and in individuals who develop changes in kidney function after intravascular contrast media, evaluate for CI-AKI as well as other causes of AKI (Not Graded). Assess the risk for CI-AKI and screen for pre-existing impairment of kidney function in all patients considered for a procedure requiring intravascular (i.v. or i.a.) administration of iodinated contrast medium (Not Graded), and consider alternative imaging methods in patients at increased risk (Not Graded). Use the lowest possible dose of contrast medium in at-risk patients (Not Graded), and we recommend using either iso-osmolar or low-osmolar iodinated contrast media rather than high-osmolar iodinated contrast media in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI (1B). For prophylaxis, we recommend i.v. volume expansion with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate solutions rather than no i.v. volume expansion (1A), we recommend not using oral fluids alone (1C), and we suggest using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) together with i.v. isotonic crystalloids in patients at increased risk (2D). We suggest not using theophylline to prevent CI-AKI (2C) and we recommend not using fenoldopam to prevent CI-AKI (1B). We suggest not using prophylactic intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or hemofiltration (HF) for contrast-media removal in patients at increased risk for CI-AKI (2C).

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^112qx7pU]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Predictive risk scores for contrast induced nephropathy were not used in either the PRESERVE trial or the quality improvement study, representing a potential missed opportunity. For the PRESERVE trial, a robust risk score might help target ideal candidates for enrolment to enrich event rates of contrast induced nephropathy and ensure that a beneficial effect is not missed. For quality improvement, a risk score would allow the clinical team to concentrate their system changes on the patients at highest risk. This targeting would help protect against improvement fatigue given the multiple quality initiatives that now exist. In fact, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² seemed to benefit more from the intervention (28% reduction), suggesting that integration of a risk score to target high risk patients could achieve an even greater reduction in the rate of contrast induced nephropathy.

Further research is needed to develop a prediction model for contrast induced nephropathy that is of comparable quality to risk scores in other disease states. Many of the existing models have been adequately derived, but newly derived models should ensure that standardised definitions are used to select and measure prognostic factors in order to reduce heterogeneity and misclassification bias. Subsequent steps would involve external validation in multicentre cohorts and integrating risk assessment with diagnostic or therapeutic decisions. This second step will require experts to suggest clinically relevant risk thresholds for contrast induced nephropathy in the clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury, which are currently lacking. Lastly, there is a need for model derivation that includes patients who undergo intravenous CT procedures, CT angiography, and non-coronary angiography. The risks associated with these procedures are likely to be different from the risk associated with arterial contrast for coronary angiography.

Clinicians should consider using one of the higher performing scores that do not include contrast volume to estimate a patient's risk of contrast induced nephropathy (as shown in the studies by Maioli and colleagues, Chen and colleagues, Gurm and colleagues, and Liu and colleagues). There are many potential applications of predictive models in general. Firstly, predictive models can inform decision making centred towards patients, whereby those at high risk can choose alternative imaging methods or opt out of further investigation. Secondly, they allow for the selective use of preprocedural manoeuvres that could mitigate the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (for example, holding diuretics to prevent intravascular volume depletion, or fluid hydration). Thirdly, they allow clinical trials and quality improvement interventions to target patients most likely to benefit from these complex efforts.

### Study evaluating the use of renalGuard to protect patients at high risk of AKI [^112x2GrF]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) can occur after cardiovascular procedures using contrast media, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. RenalGuard is a closed-loop system designed to match intravenous hydration with diuretic-induced diuresis that has shown mixed results in the prevention of CIN in previous randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

The STRENGTH (Study Evaluating the Use of RenalGuard to Protect Patients at High Risk of AKI) study assessed whether RenalGuard (PLC Medical Systems) is superior to standard intravenous hydration for CIN prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing complex cardiovascular procedures.

Methods

STRENGTH is a multicenter, international, open-label, postmarket, prospective, randomized (1:1) study monitored by the Cardiovascular European Research Center (Massy, France) that included a total of 259 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration 15–40 mL/min/m²) requiring a complex coronary, structural, or peripheral procedure with an expected contrast injection of at least 3 times the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were randomized to either RenalGuard or intravenous saline hydration according to current guidelines.

Results

The primary endpoint, the incidence of CIN at day 3 after the procedure, was similar between the 2 groups (17/107 [15.9%] in the RG group vs 15/110 [13.9%] in the control group; P = 0.62). In addition, none of the secondary endpoints differed between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

In high-risk patients undergoing complex cardiovascular interventions in experienced centers, furosemide-induced high urine output with matched hydration using the RenalGuard system did not reduce the risk of CIN and adverse outcomes at 12 months compared with conventional intravenous hydration.

### Abstract… [^114S7onT]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

IV CONTRAST Iodine-based intravenous contrast agents are used for opacification of vascular structures and solid abdominal and pelvic organs. The major families of contrast agents are ionic and nonionic. Contrast agents can be further classified as high or low osmolality, based on the iodine concentration. Most centers use nonionic contrast agents for IV contrast studies. 5 The rate of major reactions is the same for ionic and nonionic IV contrast agents — an estimated one in 170, 000 administrations — but nonionic contrast has a lower rate of minor reactions. 6 Approximately 5% to 12% of patients who receive high-osmolality contrast have adverse reactions, most of which are mild or moderate. 7 Use of low-osmolality contrast has been associated with a reduction in adverse effects. Children have a lower incidence of reactions to IV contrast agents, and most of these are mild.

7, 8 Risk factors for contrast reactions include multiple drug allergies and asthma. Although many radiology departments screen for shellfish allergy, there is no cross-reactivity between shellfish and iodinated contrast. However, patients with a documented anaphylactic reaction to any medication are at higher risk of a reaction to iodinated contrast. Contraindications to IV Contrast Concerns for using IV contrast during CT include a history of reactions to contrast agents, pregnancy, treatment of thyroid disease with radioactive iodine, use of metformin, and chronic or acutely worsening renal disease. Contrast may also be avoided when the suspected pathology is likely to be visible on noncontrast-enhanced CT. Table 1. 7 If a patient has had a previous minor reaction to an IV iodinated contrast agent, precontrast administration of oral or IV corticosteroids and diphenhydramine may decrease their risk.

A history of anaphylactic reactions would preclude IV contrast except in extreme emergencies. However, IV radiologic contrast may cause transient alteration in renal function, which could impair metformin clearance, leading to a higher risk of metabolic acidosis. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration advises that metformin should be withheld at the time of IV contrast administration and for 48 hours afterward, and resumed only after reevaluation of renal status.

### Information on gadolinium-based contrast agents… [^115t7yiR]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents are intravenous drugs used in diagnostic imaging procedures to enhance the quality of magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance angiography. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a medical imaging procedure for making images of the internal structures of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to make images. The signal in an MR image comes mainly from the protons in fat and water molecules in the body. During an MRI exam, an electric current is passed through coiled wires to create a temporary magnetic field in a patient's body. Radio waves are sent from and received by a transmitter/receiver in the machine, and these signals are used to make digital images of the scanned area of the body. A typical MRI scan last from 20
- 90 minutes, depending on the part of the body being imaged.

For some MRI exams, intravenous drugs, such as gadolinium-based contrast agents are used to change the contrast of the MR image. Gadolinium-based contrast agents are rare earth metals that are usually given through an IV in the arm.

### Association of intravenous radiocontrast with kidney function… [^1134Nedv]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Using a cohort study design and analysis that permits stronger causal interpretation than existing observational research, we found no evidence for a harmful effect on kidney function of intravenous contrast administered for CTPA in an emergency setting. One of the most important reported harms of radiocontrast administration is acute kidney injury, an adverse effect known as contrast-induced nephropathy. A number of recent observational studies, 1–8 however, found no association between contrast exposure and adverse renal outcomes. These studies suggest that although CIN may have existed with contrast agents used in the past, modern agents and doses do not appear to be harmful. 9 The existing evidence, however, is limited by a number of potential biases. These factors may contribute to forming a control group at high risk of kidney injury, creating a bias in favor of contrast and thus potentially masking harm.

Despite several studies finding no evidence for CIN, their methodological limitations preclude clear casual interpretation and mean that concern over kidney injury from contrast exposure is still widespread among clinicians. As a result, important diagnostic imaging and procedures may be avoided due to fear of CIN, especially among patients with preexisting kidney impairment. To advance knowledge on this question, new analytical approaches that allow stronger causal interpretation are required. Definitively proving a negative is difficult, but the results of our study suggest that a clinically significant association of intravenous contrast with long-term renal function is very unlikely. The lower 95% CI of our primary outcome, an eGFR drop of 4. 9 mL/min/1.73 m², is less than one-fifth of a standard deviation of baseline eGFR and of limited clinical significance.

These findings are consistent with a number of existing studies1–5 finding no association between intravenous contrast and kidney injury. However, our quasi-experimental design allows for causal interpretation with much greater confidence than existing research. At the D-dimer cutoff, there was no evidence of discontinuities in any of the measured confounders, analogous to a well-balanced randomized clinical trial, lending support to the idea that the same is true for unmeasured confounders. To our knowledge, this study provides the strongest evidence to date that intravenous contrast is not associated with significant kidney injury, further challenging the considerable clinical preoccupation with the occurrence and prevention of CIN.

### Intravenous contrast in computed tomography imaging for acute abdominal pain… [^111apDFX]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Shaish et al1 tested the diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced computed tomography scans by digitally subtracting contrast media and asking blinded radiologists to interpret the unenhanced scans ordered in the emergency department for evaluation of acute abdominal pain. Of note, this excellent study used double contrast in the reference standard, including both intravenous and oral contrast, but oral contrast is not often used in time-sensitive emergency department settings. Furthermore, it is important to note that to minimize study bias, the study participants did not have access to clinical or other imaging data and health care professional–radiologist communication, which reflects real life in that abdominal pain may be the only history provided to the radiologist and images may be interpreted before a physical examination is documented in the electronic medical record.

Despite these impediments, faculty and residents found the primary diagnosis 82% and 76% of the time, respectively, indicating the high value of CT imaging even in the absence of a detailed patient history or physical examination findings.
