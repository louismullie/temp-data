## Question

How does the incidence of cough with ACE inhibitor therapy compare to that with ARB therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the incidence of cough with ACE inhibitors compares to that with ARBs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality head-to-head evidence and FDA labeling data to anchor absolute risks. Then, I should validate these findings against meta-analyses that account for placebo cough and population differences. Next, I will examine data in patients with prior ACE inhibitor cough. After that, I need to review the mechanistic basis for the difference. Finally, I will synthesize absolute and relative risk differences, consider special populations, and outline clinical recommendations and caveats before concluding with a clear bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the quantitative signal from head-to-head trials and regulatory documents. In valsartan trials comparing an ARB to ACE inhibitors (with or without a placebo arm), dry cough occurred in 7.9% on ACE inhibitors versus 2.6% on valsartan and 1.5% on placebo, implying roughly a 67% relative risk reduction versus ACE inhibitor and rates close to placebo with the ARB; that aligns with a class difference seen repeatedly across programs [^114L7M2W].

> Wait, let me verify reproducibility with other agents and placebo controls. Controlled trials with the ACE inhibitor moexipril show cough in 6.1% on moexipril versus 2.2% on placebo, reinforcing an excess cough signal attributable to ACE inhibition, whereas losartan studies in patients with prior ACE inhibitor cough demonstrate cough rates comparable to placebo or hydrochlorothiazide during randomized follow-up, supporting that ARBs generally do not increase cough above background rates in this context [^112rLCmQ] [^114L7M2W] [^115JojXE].

> I need to check the sensitive subgroup with documented ACE inhibitor cough because that's where clinical decisions are most consequential. In a rechallenge study of 129 such patients, cough recurred in 69% on lisinopril versus 20% on valsartan and 19% on hydrochlorothiazide, showing that ARB-associated cough remains similar to control in patients predisposed to ACE inhibitor cough, whereas ACE inhibitor rechallenge triggers recurrence in the majority [^114L7M2W] [^111VZPBZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "zero cough" with ARBs; I almost said ARBs eliminate cough, but postmarketing cases of cough — including positive rechallenges — have been reported with losartan, albeit at rates that appear close to background and far lower than with ACE inhibitors, so rare idiosyncratic ARB cough can occur and should be recognized if suspected [^111VZPBZ] [^115JojXE].

> Next, I should review population-level and placebo-adjusted data to reconcile differing absolute rates across settings. A meta-analysis of 22 placebo-controlled trials in cardiovascular populations reported cough in 13.5% on ACE inhibitors and 8.5% on placebo; although absolute rates were higher than in some antihypertensive trials, the placebo-adjusted attributable fraction remained substantial, underscoring a consistent ACE inhibitor–specific effect superimposed on background cough risk in these populations [^112KkasN].

> Let me consider the mechanistic basis to ensure biological plausibility. ACE inhibitors block degradation of bradykinin and substance P, both protussive mediators, which accumulate and are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of the characteristic persistent dry cough; labels and guideline reviews repeatedly attribute the class effect to this pathway, whereas ARBs do not impair bradykinin metabolism because they antagonize the AT1 receptor without inhibiting ACE, explaining why ARB cough rates mirror placebo in randomized settings [^112BzfjR] [^112rLCmQ] [^1173ADh6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that the quantitative synthesis aligns across sources before I draw clinical inferences. In general hypertensive trial settings, ACE inhibitor cough typically falls around 5–8% versus 2–3% on ARBs, consistent with the valsartan and moexipril data, while in higher-risk cardiovascular cohorts the absolute ACE inhibitor cough rate can reach the low teens with a smaller but still notable placebo-adjusted excess; taken together, ARBs reduce cough risk by roughly 60–70% relative to ACE inhibitors, with an absolute difference of about 5–7% in typical practice populations and a pronounced benefit in prior ACE inhibitor cough where ARB cough approximates placebo [^114L7M2W] [^112rLCmQ] [^112KkasN].

> I need to ensure the clinical guidance reflects both efficacy equivalence and tolerability differences. For patients who develop ACE inhibitor cough, switching to an ARB is the preferred strategy given comparable cardiovascular efficacy and much lower cough risk; some clinicians consider starting with an ARB in individuals at high perceived cough risk or in whom distinguishing ACE inhibitor cough from comorbid respiratory symptoms would be challenging, such as patients with asthma or in populations with higher observed ACE inhibitor cough risk (for example, Chinese ethnicity), acknowledging that these latter data are observational [^112HdZPs] [^116BAwP2] [^112BzfjR].

> But wait, I should also review safety caveats and class-effect reminders. ACE inhibitor cough is a class effect that can begin within hours or months after initiation and typically resolves within 1–4 weeks of discontinuation, although persistence up to 3 months is described; labels for individual ACE inhibitors, such as ramipril and perindopril, emphasize cough and related upper airway adverse effects, while ARB labels note cough rates similar to placebo with rare postmarketing reports, so clinicians should reassess for other etiologies if cough persists despite stopping the ACE inhibitor [^112BzfjR] [^113kJvp3] [^111VZPBZ].

> Bottom line, after verifying head-to-head trials, placebo-controlled data, and mechanistic plausibility, ACE inhibitor therapy is consistently associated with a higher incidence of persistent dry cough than ARB therapy, with typical absolute rates around 6–8% for ACE inhibitors versus 2–3% for ARBs in general use, translating to an approximate 60–70% relative reduction in cough risk with ARBs and near-placebo cough rates in patients with prior ACE inhibitor cough when switched to an ARB, all of which supports choosing an ARB when cough arises on an ACE inhibitor and considering ARBs up front when cough risk or diagnostic ambiguity is a concern [^114L7M2W] [^112KkasN] [^111VZPBZ].

---

ACE inhibitors are associated with a significantly higher incidence of cough than ARBs, with rates of **5–20%** for ACE inhibitors versus **1–3%** for ARBs [^112BzfjR] [^114L7M2W]. The risk of cough is approximately **threefold higher** with ACE inhibitors than with ARBs, and ARBs have cough rates similar to placebo [^111VZPBZ]. This difference is clinically important and often leads to switching from ACE inhibitors to ARBs when cough occurs [^112BzfjR].

## Incidence of cough with ACE inhibitors

- The incidence of cough with ACE inhibitors varies across studies, but consistently falls within the **5–20%** range.

- A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^112KkasN] reported a placebo-adjusted ACE inhibitor cough incidence of **13.5%**, with 8.5% on placebo, indicating that approximately 37% of reported cough cases are attributable to ACE inhibitors.

- The onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough can occur within hours to months after initiation, and typically resolves within **1 to 4 weeks** after discontinuation, although it may persist for up to 3 months in some cases [^112BzfjR].

---

## Incidence of cough with ARBs

- ARBs are associated with a **significantly lower** incidence of cough compared to ACE inhibitors, typically ranging from **1–3%** [^114L7M2W].

- In clinical trials comparing valsartan (an ARB) to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in the valsartan group (**2.6%**) compared to the ACE inhibitor group (**7.9%**) and was similar to placebo (**1.5%**) [^114L7M2W].

- Similarly, losartan (another ARB) [^111VZPBZ] demonstrated cough incidence rates **comparable to placebo** or hydrochlorothiazide in patients who previously experienced ACE inhibitor-induced cough.

---

## Comparative incidence of cough: ACE inhibitors vs. ARBs

Multiple studies consistently show that ACE inhibitors have a significantly higher incidence of cough than ARBs, with approximately a **threefold higher risk** [^112BzfjR]. ARBs have cough rates **similar to placebo** [^111VZPBZ], indicating a minimal risk of cough with ARB therapy.

---

## Clinical implications

- The higher incidence of cough associated with ACE inhibitors often leads to **discontinuation or switching** to alternative antihypertensive therapies [^112BzfjR].

- ARBs are frequently recommended as **alternative therapy** for patients who develop ACE inhibitor-induced cough due to their significantly lower risk of cough.

- The choice between ACE inhibitors and ARBs should consider **patient-specific factors**, including the risk of cough and patient tolerance [^1124biLi].

In trials where valsartan was compared to an ACE inhibitor with or without placebo, the incidence of dry cough was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor group (7.9%) than in the groups who received valsartan (2.6%) or placebo (1.5%). In a trial involving 129 patients who had previously experienced dry cough with ACE inhibitors, the incidences of cough in patients treated with valsartan, HCTZ, or lisinopril were 20%, 19%, and 69% respectively (p < 0.001).

Dose-related orthostatic effects were observed in less than 1% of patients. An increased incidence of dizziness was noted in patients treated with Diovan 320 mg (8%) compared to those receiving 10 to 160 mg (2% to 4%).

- **Pediatric hypertension**: Diovan has been evaluated for safety in 290 pediatric patients aged 1 to less than 6 years and over 400 patients aged 6 to 17 years. No relevant differences were identified between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients and that previously reported for adult patients. Hyperkalemia was more frequently observed in pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Rate of cough during treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^112KkasN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). High credibility.

Use of protective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is sometimes limited by incident coughing. In clinical trials, cough also occurred with placebo. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting cough on ACE-I in patients with CVD.

- **Evaluation**: We evaluated the attributable fraction of cough on ACE-I by accounting for the rate on placebo: placebo-adjusted ACE-I (%) = (ACE-I (%) - Placebo (%)) / ACE-I (%).

In total, 65,054 patients from 22 included studies were analyzed. Placebo-adjusted ACE-I cough was 37% of 13.5% reported cases on ACE-I, while 8.5% reported cases on placebo were equivalent to 63% of cases on ACE-I, indicating potential other factors for cough beyond ACE-I in a substantial number of cases.

- **Observed trends**: Placebo-adjusted ACE-I cough exhibited the highest rates in individuals with arterial hypertension (85%) and the lowest in those with heart failure (29%). Therefore, other causes of cough, particularly in heart failure, should be excluded before considering ACE-I withdrawal.

### Hyzaar [^111VZPBZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Persistent dry cough has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and can lead to the discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril, whose cough disappeared on placebo, were randomized to receive losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or either placebo (one study, n = 97) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy.

Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Hyzaar. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
	- **Digestive**: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan.
	- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia.
	- **Hypersensitivity**: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx.

### ACE inhibitors: upper respiratory symptoms [^114sHPRV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Cough and angioedema are well-known adverse reactions of ACE inhibitors. However, other adverse effects involving the upper airways, such as postnasal drainage, rhinitis, and nasal blockage, are less frequently recognized. These might share the same pathophysiological mechanism: bradykinin accumulation. We present two patients with ACE inhibitor-induced upper respiratory symptoms that improved after the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and substitution with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The incidence of these adverse events is not accurately known, as they are not required to be reported, but it is estimated to be low. This presents challenges to the physician and demonstrates the importance of considering these symptoms in the differential diagnosis. Most physicians are aware of ACE inhibitor-induced cough but may not recognize ACE inhibitor-induced nasal blockage, rhinitis, or postnasal drainage. Identifying these can avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatment.

During our study period, over 98.6% of all COVID-19 RT-PCR tests in England were undertaken in a hospital setting for symptomatic patients sufficiently unwell to warrant hospital assessment and admission.

- **Our main outcomes for these analyses were**: COVID-19 RT-PCR test positive disease and COVID-19-related admission for ICU care.

- **Primary exposure variables**: We had two main exposures of interest: ACE inhibitors and ARBs. We classified a patient as having had exposure to either medication if they had three or more prescriptions, including a prescription issued in the 90 days preceding cohort entry.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^113P5vYx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is a burdensome condition characterized by the dysregulation of vagal sensory neurons that mediate cough. Several molecular targets have been investigated on the basis of their potential roles in the underlying pathophysiology of refractory chronic cough (RCC) and unexplained chronic cough (UCC). Although results have varied between investigative approaches and there are currently no new approved treatments for these conditions, promising results have been reported for some investigated pharmacologic treatments. Given the heterogeneity underlying chronic cough, it is likely that the best therapeutic approach will vary by patient, necessitating further multidisciplinary research to establish the best treatment pathways for this patient population.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers and adverse outcomes of influenza and pneumonia: A Danish cohort study [^113di3ot]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The primary study outcomes were death within 30 days after hospital admission and ICU admissions during the index hospitalization, including transfers between departments and hospitals after the diagnosis of influenza or pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included organ-supportive treatment during ICU admission with mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, and inotropes/vasopressors. Dialysis-treated acute kidney injury was defined as treatment with acute renal replacement therapy in patients with no history of previous dialysis for chronic kidney disease. Outcomes were ascertained using population registry data for all-cause death, and diagnosis and procedure data from the patient registry for all other outcomes.

Data on all filled prescriptions for cardiovascular medications were obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Our main exposure of interest was the use of either ACE-Is or ARBs. We defined use as a filled prescription within 90 days before the hospital contact for influenza or pneumonia; most prescriptions for ACE-Is/ARBs filled in Danish pharmacies are for a 3-month supply.

In our main analyses, ACE-I/ARB users were compared with Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) users and with nonusers of ACE-Is/ARBs (no prescription 365 days before index date). We chose CCBs as the active comparator drug because CCBs are also a first-line treatment for hypertension and have no known pharmacological effects on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, unlike β blockers and thiazides.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^112dJtTX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Managing comorbidities in patients with asthma may be associated with additional risks. When evaluated for the management of hypertension, ARBs are thought to have similar effects on blood pressure, mortality, and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with ACEIs, yet fewer patients in the general population withdraw from clinical trials due to adverse effects when treated with ARBs compared with ACEIs. Despite the potentially higher incidence of switching with enalapril, the largest determinant regarding absolute risk in people with asthma appears to be a person's age, sex, and BMI. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the population combined with the increasing age of patients, such factors are important determinants in considering whether ARBs should be recommended as first-line therapy. This is particularly relevant for people with asthma, for whom distinguishing ACEI-induced cough from symptoms of uncontrolled asthma may be complex, potentially leading to unnecessary asthma treatment if not immediately recognized.

Many guidelines for managing patients with cardiovascular disease continue to recommend ACEIs as first-choice therapy, reserving ARBs as an alternative when patients are intolerant to ACEIs. This has led to recent calls to change these recommendations due to the equal efficacy but fewer adverse reactions with ARBs, potentially avoiding unnecessary healthcare appointments, patient treatment disutility, and delays in establishing effective therapy for the underlying clinical condition.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pjQUM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are prone to developing side effects like hypotension and even refractory hypotension during anesthesia, and whether ACEIs/ARBs should be continued or discontinued in such patients remains debatable. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the consequences of continuing or withholding these drugs, especially with regards to the incidence of intraoperative hypotension, in patients who continue to use ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their scheduled surgery.

- **Methods**: Studies with data pertinent to the incidence of intraoperative hypotension during anesthesia use in patients who continued the use of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their scheduled surgery were considered for inclusion.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies reporting on the incidences of intraoperative hypotension between patients who continued receiving ACEIs/ARBs and those who did not on the day of their surgical procedure were included. The pooled effects showed that hypotension during anesthesia was more likely to develop in patients who continued to take ACEIs/ARBs compared to those who did not (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.21–1.64). However, there were no significant differences between these groups of patients regarding postoperative complications, including ST-T abnormalities, myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, major adverse cardiac events, acute kidney injury, or death (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.76–2.04). The differences remained similar in subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

### Moexipril hydrochloride [^112rLCmQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. In controlled trials with moexipril, cough was present in 6.1% of moexipril patients and 2.2% of patients given placebo.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be advised to take moexipril one hour before meals (see Clinical Pharmacology and Dosage and Administration).

- **Angioedema**: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, usually occurring early in therapy (within the first month). Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in breathing) and to take no more moexipril hydrochloride until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur with moexipril hydrochloride, especially during the first few days of therapy. If fainting occurs, the patient should stop taking moexipril hydrochloride and consult the prescribing physician. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion, such as vomiting or diarrhea, may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised accordingly.

The data that support the findings of this study are available within the article. The protocol of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42021237859) before the study commenced and is available in full on the National Institute for Health Research International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. This study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses checklist (Table S1).

- **Data sources and searches**: Systematic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from December 1, 2019, near to when the first case of SARS‐CoV‐2 was identified, until October 21, 2021. A combination of subject headings for COVID‐19 and RAAS inhibitors was used (Table S2). Searches were limited to "human" studies only. A manual search of the citations included in identified reviews and articles selected for full‐text retrieval was also performed.

- **Study selection, inclusion, and exclusion criteria**: Two investigators (J. L. and F. C. T.) independently performed study selection using Covidence, an online, Cochrane-approved software designed for conducting systematic reviews. Discrepancies in inclusion or exclusion were solved through consultation with a third investigator (J. S.). To address the risk of bias in all observational studies of RAAS inhibitor — COVID‐19 associations, the systematic review initially identified studies that compared the risk of infection with COVID‐19 and/or severe COVID‐19 outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit).

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^116X18bo]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute bronchitis, specifically concerning symptomatic therapy, the ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend avoiding the initiation of antitussives, inhaled β-agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), oral corticosteroids, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other therapies in immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and risk of lung cancer: population based cohort study [^112dVyri]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Thirdly, we compared ACEIs with angiotensin receptor blockers, as the latter also act on the renin-angiotensin system and are used at the same disease stage but have not been associated with neuropeptide accumulation in the lung. However, angiotensin receptor blockers may also have an effect on lung cancer incidence, and a meta-analysis of observational studies reported a decreased risk with these drugs. Studies included in this meta-analysis had some limitations, and several compared angiotensin receptor blockers with ACEIs. Thus, the apparent protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers may be the result of a deleterious effect of ACEIs on lung cancer incidence. Nevertheless, our study was designed to consider this possibility by comparing ACEIs with thiazide diuretics in ancillary analyses. Reassuringly, this analysis yielded consistent results, both in terms of overall association and by cumulative duration of use.

Importantly, our analyses comparing angiotensin receptor blockers with thiazide diuretics produced null associations for both overall and cumulative duration of use. This suggests that the observed increased risk with ACEIs is unlikely to be attributable to the purported antitumor effects of angiotensin receptor blockers. Fourthly, misclassification of the outcome is possible; however, lung cancer has been shown to be well recorded in the CPRD when compared with the UK National Cancer Data Repository, with a concordance rate of 93%. Associations may also vary by subtypes of lung cancer, but this information was not available within the CPRD.

### Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors and COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis revealing critical bias across a body of observational research [^111QWGgE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses indicate that in those using an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in monotherapy, there is a lower risk of hospitalization (ACE inhibitor: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66–0.87; P < 0.001; ARB: HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.97; P = 0.015) and intubation or death (ACE inhibitor: HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48–0.85; P = 0.002; ARB: HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.95; P = 0.019) with COVID-19, when compared with those using a calcium channel blocker or TZD in monotherapy. The heterogeneity in each mortality analysis was likely driven by the low number of events in the study from Sweden. The direction of the estimates varied little when a random-effects meta-analysis was used.

Figure 3 presents forest plots for each outcome assessed in the fixed-effects meta-analyses. Associations are shown between: (A) the use of an ACE inhibitor in monotherapy and hospitalization, (B) the use of an ACE inhibitor in monotherapy and intubation or death, (C) the use of an ARB in monotherapy and hospitalization, and (D) the use of an ARB in monotherapy and intubation or death. ACEi indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; HR, hazard ratio; and TZD, thiazide diuretic.

The GRADE indicates that the protective effects detected by the meta-analyses are probably not clinically relevant. The risk of hospitalization, intubation, or death varies little between those using a RAAS inhibitor and those using a calcium channel blocker or TZD.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114AR4Ko]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

According to the ACCP 2020 guidelines, in specific circumstances for asthma, especially for patients with chronic cough, it is recommended to consider increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor. This should be done after reconsidering alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients if the response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Risk of pneumonia associated with use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116C6z6y]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review longitudinal studies evaluating the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and their association with the risk of pneumonia.

This research utilized a systematic review and meta-analysis design. Data sources included Medline through PubMed, the Web of Science with conference proceedings (from inception to June 2011), and the US Food and Drug Administration website (June 2011). Systematic reviews and references of retrieved articles were also searched.

For study selection, two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that evaluated the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the risk of pneumonia. They retrieved characteristics of the studies and data estimates.

In data synthesis, the primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia, while the secondary outcome focused on pneumonia-related mortality. Subgroup analyses were performed based on baseline morbidities (such as stroke, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease) and patient characteristics (Asian and non-Asian populations). Pooled estimates of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived through random effects meta-analysis. Adjusted frequentist indirect comparisons between ACE inhibitors and ARBs were estimated and combined with direct evidence when available. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test.

The results included 37 eligible studies. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of pneumonia compared to control treatment ([19 studies: odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.80; I² = 79%] and ARBs (combined direct and indirect odds ratio).

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113yP4FY]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The concept of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system originated from an experimental model purporting to show a "synergistic" effect between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The concept seemed so logical and appealing that seemingly beneficial changes in surrogate endpoints such as blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction became accepted as a free pass for dual blockade having cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects.

Despite a lack of solid evidence on the safety and efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, this type of therapy has been mentioned in several sets of guidelines. Thus, dual therapy was commonly used in patients with hypertension and with diabetes or proteinuria, or both, and also to a lesser extent in those with heart failure resistant to treatment. Even patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were not entirely able to escape this fashionable trend. In the United States, more than 200,000 patients are currently treated with dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, most of them by the combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor (70%). Some other combinations are also used, such as two ACE inhibitors (15%), two angiotensin receptor blockers (5%), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in combination with a direct renin inhibitor (8%). The long-term efficacy and safety of dual blockade is not, however, well defined.

We compared the long-term efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112eykiT]. Chest (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, particularly in relation to symptomatic therapy, the ACCP 2006 guidelines recommend not using β₂ agonist bronchodilators routinely to alleviate cough in most patients with acute bronchitis. However, it is advised to consider offering β₂ agonist bronchodilators to selected adult patients who experience wheezing accompanying the cough.

### A register-based study: Cough - a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^116MZuen]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Results

Over a period of 10 years (2008–2017), 203,688 patients redeemed ≥ 2 relevant prescriptions within 90 days. Of these, 99,472 were ineligible and 104,216 were included in the Prescription registry population (group 1). During the same period, 57,754 patients were diagnosed with cough in the Patient registry. Among them, 23,494 were ineligible, and 34,260 were included (group 2). A total of 4004 patients (6.9%) were excluded due to ACE inhibitor initiation less than 12 weeks prior to the diagnosis of cough. In the combined Prescription and Patient registry population, 11,209 patients were registered with both ≥ 2 redeemed prescriptions and a cough diagnosis. Of these, 8024 were ineligible and 3185 were included (group 3).

All patients included are sorted in Table 1 using the definitions for UCC (no relevant co-morbidity ± 12 months from diagnosis) and RCC (cough-relevant co-morbidity related to diagnosis). They are divided into three groups: Prescription registry, Patient registry, and the combination of the two. Of the 104,216 patients from the Prescription registry group, 52,727 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome), and 51,489 were classified with RCC (secondary outcome). Of the 34,260 patients from the Patient registry, 12,278 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome) and 21,982 as having RCC. There were 3185 patients present in both the Prescription registry and the Patient registry, where 529 were classified as having UCC and 2656 as having RCC.

### Treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and risk of severe/lethal COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^116CYd1J]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might either increase or reduce the risk of severe or lethal COVID-19. The findings from available observational studies varied, and summary estimates are urgently needed to elucidate whether these drugs should be suspended during the pandemic, or if patients and physicians should be definitively reassured. This meta-analysis of adjusted observational data aimed to summarize the existing evidence on the association between these medications and severe/lethal COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We searched MedLine, Scopus, and preprint repositories up to June 8, 2020, to retrieve cohort or case-control studies comparing the risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 — defined as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, or death — among hypertensive subjects treated with: (1) ACE inhibitors, (2) ARBs, and (3) both, versus untreated subjects. Data were combined using a random-effect generic inverse variance approach.

- **Results**: Ten studies enrolling 9,890 hypertensive subjects were included in the analyses. Compared with untreated subjects, those using either ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed a similar risk of severe or lethal COVID-19 (summary OR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26 for ACE inhibitors; 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12 for ARBs). The results did not change when both drugs were considered together, when death was the outcome, and when excluding studies with significant, divergent results.

- **Conclusion**: The present meta-analysis strongly supports the recommendation of several scientific societies to continue the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117Q27ie]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

In 26 trials, 4,265 of 24,994 patients (17.1%) experienced withdrawal due to drug-related adverse events in the dual therapy group, compared with 5,825 of 40,247 patients (14.5%) in the monotherapy group. Dual therapy was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of withdrawal owing to drug-related adverse events (1.27, 1.21 to 1.32, I² = 2%, P < 0.001) compared with monotherapy.

- **Subgroup analysis of increased risk**:
	- In subgroup analysis, the risk of withdrawal due to drug-related adverse events increased significantly in both the cohort with heart failure (P < 0.001) and without heart failure (P = 0.0003).

- **Subgroup analysis of safety outcomes**:
	- Comparing the combination of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with ACE inhibitors alone, the risk of all safety outcomes — such as hyperkalaemia, hypotension, renal failure, and withdrawal due to drug-related adverse events — increased significantly with combination treatment. In contrast, when comparing the combination of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin receptor blockers alone, the risk of hypotension and withdrawal due to drug-related adverse events increased significantly, but not the risk of hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Additionally, when comparing the combination of ACE inhibitors and aliskiren with ACE inhibitors alone, the risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension increased significantly, whereas there was no significant difference in the risk of renal failure.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure-lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been specified.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1122FDpY]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

A total of 138 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. The 33 trials enrolled 68,405 patients with a mean age of 61 (SD 4) years, 71% men, and had a follow-up duration of a mean 52 weeks. A combination of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker was used in 22 trials, an ACE inhibitor and aliskiren in three trials, an angiotensin receptor blocker and aliskiren in seven trials, and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker with aliskiren in one trial.

Efficacy data were available from seven trials with a total of 56,824 patients (mean age 65 (SD 2) years, 72% males) and a mean duration of 2.7 years. Safety data were available from all of the included trials.

- **Study quality assessment**: Of the 33 trials, 18 reported adequate generation of allocation sequence and adequate allocation concealment, and 24 reported adequate masking of participants, staff, and outcome assessors. Based on quality assessment, 18 were deemed to be at low risk of bias and the remainder at high risk.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers and risk of cancer: Cohort study among people receiving antihypertensive drugs in UK General Practice Research Database [^114ZWWkT]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, patients were not randomized to their treatments. Recent data suggest that observational studies generally provide robust estimates of adverse effects, but care must be taken: in a non-randomized setting, treatment decisions might be linked to the particular circumstances or medical history of the patient. In this case, the decision to use those treated with ACE inhibitors as the main comparison group should have reduced confounding by indication as the two classes of drugs have similar indications. Nevertheless, the reasons for treatment with one class over the other might have been linked to patients' health, particularly given the association of ACE inhibitors with cough. If angiotensin receptor blockers were selectively prescribed to those with underlying health problems associated with cancer, a spurious positive result might have been detected for some cancers.

As we also included those switching to an angiotensin receptor blocker during follow-up in our analysis, a non-causal association might have been induced if the reasons for switching were linked to the underlying cancer risk; we dealt with this issue by excluding the 12 months of person-time following a switch to an angiotensin receptor blocker, extending this to two and then three years in sensitivity analyses. We also conducted a post hoc analysis of data specifically from the first 12 months of angiotensin receptor blocker use to provide information regarding the likely causality of the associations detected.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic cough [^113ABCH6]. Allergy and Asthma Proceedings (2006). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, chronic cough can be caused by:

- **Respiratory conditions**: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, upper airway cough syndrome, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis

- **Cardiac and related conditions**: heart failure, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations

- **Infectious diseases**: whooping cough, pulmonary tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex disease, paragonimiasis, lung abscess

- **Neoplastic conditions**: lung cancer, bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, Hodgkin's lymphoma

- **Allergic and autoimmune conditions**: allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis

- **Environmental and lifestyle factors**: tobacco use, passive smoking

- **Other pulmonary diseases**: cystic fibrosis, asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker pneumoconiosis

- **Gastrointestinal conditions**: gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal diverticulum

- **Sleep disorders and structural issues**: obstructive sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, vocal cord dysfunction

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^116uKXLt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease causing significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Comorbidity in asthma is common; 62.6% of people with asthma have been reported to have one or more comorbidities, and the likelihood of having coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease is significantly greater in people with asthma compared with the general population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are commonly prescribed medicines indicated for the management of these chronic diseases. They block the enzyme responsible for converting the peptide hormone angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which stimulates aldosterone release and causes vasoconstriction.

Although ACEIs have beneficial effects in managing these chronic diseases, many patients are intolerant of long-term ACEI use. The most common reason for intolerance is a dry, persistent cough. This adverse drug reaction is thought to occur in around 10% of people treated with ACEIs and may be related to increased levels of bradykinin. This adverse reaction is considered a class effect of ACEIs, suggesting that even low doses may alter bradykinin levels in susceptible patients.

In people who develop ACEI intolerance from a cough, it is recommended that patients are switched to angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Angiotensin-II receptor blockers have properties similar to those of ACEIs but do not cause a persistent dry cough.

### Safety and tolerability of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor versus the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114cpXMa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

The addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with heart failure remains controversial. A recent meta-analysis showed that the combination therapy reduces hospitalization without improved survival. Whether excess risk is associated with this strategy has not been fully explored. We sought to quantify the risk of adverse events of combination therapy (ACEI+ARB) versus ACEI alone.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Cochrane databases were searched. Eligible studies were randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACEI versus the combination of ACEI+ARB in patients with heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Included studies were reviewed to determine the frequency of adverse effects leading to discontinuation of therapy.

- **Results**: Nine trials that enrolled 18,160 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 9199 patients received combination therapy, and 8961 patients received an ACEI only. Patients receiving combination therapy had an increased risk of developing any adverse effect by 2.3% (relative risk [RR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15–1.40, P < .00001, I² = 15.9%, number needed to harm [NNH] = 42), hypotension by 1.1% (RR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.37–2.66, P = 0.0002, I² = 26.6%, NNH = 89), worsening renal function by 1% (RR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.30–3.46, P = 0.003, I² = 67.3%, NNH = 100), and hyperkalemia by 0.6% (RR = 4.17, 95% CI = 2.31–7.53, P < .00001, I² = 0%, NNH = 149). There was no difference in angioedema (RR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.43–1.80, P = 0.72, I² = 0%).

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers and adverse outcomes of influenza and pneumonia: A Danish cohort study [^111qorDg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In the subgroup of patients diagnosed with influenza, 30‐day mortality was 5.2% in ACE‐I/ARB users and 3.9% in CCB users (RD, 1.3%; 95% CI, −1.2 to 3.8; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.69–2.55). The risk of ICU admission was 8.2% in ACE‐I/ARB users and 9.6% in CCB users (RD, −1.4%; 95% CI, −5.7 to 3.0; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.53–1.39). The risk of ICU admission with the need for mechanical ventilation was similar in ACE‐I/ARB and CCB users (4.5% versus 4.6%).

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers and adverse outcomes of influenza and pneumonia: A Danish cohort study [^114EQQ6Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Follow-up started on the date of hospital contact with influenza/pneumonia and continued until the specific outcome of interest, emigration, or up to 30 days, whichever occurred first. The 30-day risk of death and ICU admission was computed and plotted, both crude and PS-weighted. Risk differences (RDs) were computed for all outcomes by subtracting PS-weighted risks. Risk ratios (RRs) were estimated as the ratio of PS-weighted risk estimates. All estimates were presented with 95% CIs obtained through bootstrapping with 200 bootstrap samples.

Additional analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our findings.

- **Exposure definition**: We changed the exposure definition to make a head-to-head comparison between ACE-I/ARB and β blockers and thiazides, respectively.
- **Monotherapy comparison**: We compared monotherapy with ACE-I/ARB with CCB monotherapy.
- **Primary diagnoses**: Analyses were repeated using only the primary (first-listed) diagnoses of influenza or pneumonia.
- **Age stratification**: Analyses were stratified by age at the index date (18–65 years and > 65 years).
- **Underlying indications**: Analyses were repeated according to potential underlying indications for treatment, including patients with renal disease, with congestive heart failure, with ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction or stable angina pectoris), with diabetes mellitus, and without any of these comorbidities, and in patients without any of these comorbidities who had a hospital diagnosis of hypertension.
- **Polytherapy**: We repeated the analyses restricted to patients currently using more than one antihypertensive medication.
- **Care setting**: We stratified by hospital versus community settings.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough, which cannot be explained following a basic evaluation, is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy regarding whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough.

Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. However, in many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent, and their cough remains unexplained.

There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Risk of pneumonia associated with use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yScKe]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

An indirect comparison of ACE inhibitors with ARBs showed a significant 30% reduction in the risk of pneumonia associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (0.70, 0.56 to 0.86). Similar results were obtained from pooled direct and indirect estimates (0.69, 0.56 to 0.85) without discrepancy (P = 0.82) or heterogeneity (I² = 0%) between both estimates. The NNT for 2.2 years based on this estimate was 72 (51 to 147).

- **Subgroup analyses for primary outcome**:

- **Patients with previous stroke**: In patients with previous stroke, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 54% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with controls (0.46, 0.34 to 0.62, I² = 0%; seven studies pooled). In the same population, however, the use of ARBs was not associated with a significant reduction in risk (0.86, 0.67 to 1.09; I² = 0%; two studies pooled).

	- The pooled estimate from indirect (odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 1.79) and direct (0.38, 0.17 to 0.81) evidence of ACE inhibitors compared with ARBs showed a significant 58% reduction in the risk of pneumonia (0.42, 0.22 to 0.80), without discrepancy (P = 0.44) or heterogeneity (I² = 0%) between indirect and direct estimates.

- **Patients with heart failure**: In patients with heart failure, two studies evaluated the risk of pneumonia in those treated with ACE inhibitors, and two other studies reported data for those treated with ARBs. ACE inhibitors were associated with…

### Potential future therapies for the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114r2Fjh]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

When the etiology of a patient's chronic cough is established, specific antitussive therapy aimed at a particular cause of cough is highly effective. Nevertheless, in certain situations, therapy with cough suppressants, previously classified as nonspecific antitussive therapy, which aim to suppress the cough reflex regardless of the cause of cough, will be necessary.

- **Methodology**: The data for this review were obtained through a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search conducted in June 2004. Literature published in the English language from 1966 to 2004 was reviewed using the search terms "cough", "antitussive", "pharmacotherapy", "future therapies", and "potential therapies".

- **Results/Conclusions**: Currently available cough-suppressant therapy is severely limited by a dearth of effective agents and/or their unacceptable side effects. Several classes of pharmacologic agents are currently under investigation to develop clinically useful cough suppressants.

### Systematic review: Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for treating essential hypertension [^1124biLi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The relative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for lowering blood pressure is unknown. The purpose of this review was to compare the benefits and harms of ACE inhibitors versus ARBs for treating essential hypertension in adults.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2006), and selected reference lists were searched for relevant English-language trials. The MEDLINE search was updated to August 2007 to identify head-to-head trials that reported blood pressure outcomes and major cardiovascular events.

- **Study selection**: A total of 61 clinical studies directly compared ACE inhibitors versus ARBs in adult patients with essential hypertension. These studies reported an outcome of interest, lasted at least 12 weeks, and included at least 20 patients.

- **Data extraction**: A standardized protocol with predefined criteria was used to extract data on study design, interventions, population characteristics, and outcomes. The study quality and applicability were evaluated, and the strength of the body of evidence for key outcomes was assessed.

- **Data synthesis**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs had similar long-term effects on blood pressure (50 studies; strength of evidence, high). No consistent differential effects were observed for other outcomes. Few studies reported long-term outcomes, including death, cardiovascular events, quality of life, rate of single antihypertensive agent use, lipid levels, progression to diabetes, left ventricular mass or function, and kidney disease. The studies consistently showed fair- to good-quality evidence.

### Arbli [^115JojXE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in a population that had experienced coughing with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience.

- **Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy**: In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint (LIFE) study, adverse reactions with losartan were similar to those reported previously for patients with hypertension.

- **Nephropathy in Type 2 diabetic patients**: In the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study involving 1,513 patients treated with losartan or placebo, the overall incidences of reported adverse events were similar for the two groups. Discontinuations of losartan because of side effects were similar to placebo (19% for losartan, 24% for placebo). The adverse events, regardless of drug relationship, reported with an incidence of ≥ 4% of patients treated with losartan and occurring with a ≥ 2% difference in the losartan group vs. placebo on a background of conventional antihypertensive therapy, included asthenia/fatigue, chest pain, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, anemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, back pain, muscular weakness, and urinary tract infection.

- **Postmarketing experience**: Additional adverse reactions have been observed in the postmarketing period.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^1152Go2Y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Figure 1: The anatomical and molecular mediators of cough**: The cough cascade can be triggered in the airway by activation of vagal sensory neurons originating from the jugular and nodose ganglia. Airway sensory nerve activation results in an action potential being carried along the vagus nerve to the central nervous system via projections to the brain stem, specifically at the nTS and the Pa5. Release of neurotransmitters by these primary afferents can activate reflex pathways controlling respiratory muscles to evoke involuntary cough and/or second-order neurons projecting to higher brain regions that evoke behavioral cough or sensations of an urge to cough.

- **Stimulation and activation of airway sensory neurons**: Ion channels expressed by vagal sensory nerves respond to various chemical and mechanical stimuli to trigger depolarization of the plasma membrane. Influx of calcium may trigger sensory nerves to release neuropeptides. One action of neuropeptides may be to bind to receptors on epithelial cells (e.g. NK‐1), inducing release of proinflammatory mediators. Ion channels can also be found on airway epithelial cells, where stimulation can lead to calcium influx that triggers release of inflammatory mediators that may perpetuate further sensory nerve activation. Although the underlying mechanisms are not precisely known, ATP can be released through pannexin channels and activate P2X3 channels, leading to cell depolarization. Cumulative depolarization of a sufficient magnitude can trigger the opening of NaVs expressed by sensory nerves, leading to the generation of an action potential.

### A register-based study: Cough - a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^111pePCo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons for contact with the primary health sector. It may present as an acute, subacute, or chronic condition, with the latter being particularly troubling for patients and challenging for medical staff to treat.

Coughing is a normal physiological process; it is a protective reflex that clears debris and secretions from the airways. The cough reflex consists of an afferent sensory limb and a central processing center, activating the efferent limb. The afferent nerves involved include the vagal nerve and its sensory branches. These important sensory nerves are found from the pharynx to the terminal bronchioles, with most located in the larynx, carina, and bifurcation of the larger bronchi. The signal that irritants are present in the bronchial system is mediated to the cough center in the brainstem. The efferent pathways are then mediated back to the respiratory tract through the vagal, phrenic, and spinal motor nerves. This interaction causes activity in the respiratory muscles, closure of the vocal cords, and activation of the bronchial smooth muscles. This mechanism is present in cough as a protective mechanism, as a symptom of underlying conditions, and as a reflex which has become dysregulated.

Chronic cough is often, but not always, associated with various co-morbidities both in the respiratory area and outside the thorax. The most common underlying conditions in patients with chronic cough include upper airway cough syndrome, chronic eosinophilic bronchitis, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

### Combination therapy with an angiotensin receptor blocker and an ACE inhibitor in proteinuric renal disease: A systematic review of the efficacy and safety data [^116nBWy6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was shown to decrease urinary protein excretion and slow the progression of both diabetic and nondiabetic proteinuric renal disease. The safety and efficacy of combined ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy are not well established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease. Twenty-one randomized controlled studies (n = 654 patients) were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases. Five trials had a parallel-group design and 16 trials used a crossover design. Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB resulted in a small but significant increase in serum potassium levels (weighted mean difference, 0.11 mEq/L [0.11 mmol/L]; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.17) and a nonsignificant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (weighted mean difference, 1.4 mL/min [0.02 mL/s]; 95% CI, -2.6 to 0.2). The addition of an ARB resulted in a further decrease in proteinuria (weighted mean difference, 440 mg/d; 95% CI, 289 to 591) compared with an ACE inhibitor alone. This effect was observed in patients with diabetic (210 mg/d; 95% CI, 84 to 336) and nondiabetic (582 mg/d; 95% CI, 371 to 793) renal disease. In conclusion, the combination of ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease is safe, without clinically meaningful changes in serum potassium levels.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme-related cough among Chinese-Americans [^116BAwP2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the relationship between ethnicity and the tolerance of hypertension medications. We investigated the perception that Chinese-Americans may have a higher incidence of chronic cough from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

- **Methods**: We searched electronic databases to identify patients who had received a new lisinopril prescription. This cohort was separated into 295 patients of Chinese descent and 4,263 patients in the general population group with an instrument that used surnames to identify Chinese ethnicity. For those who discontinued lisinopril within 1 year, we reviewed medical records to determine reasons for discontinuation. We compared rates of discontinuation overall and due to cough by ethnic group (Chinese vs general population).

- **Results**: The Chinese population was more likely to discontinue their medication (47%) than the general population (31%). When the cause for discontinuation was examined, cough was significantly higher among Chinese, with a relative risk of 2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.11–3.03. The risk for angioedema was < 1%, and no difference in the risk of angioedema was found between the two groups. When controlled for age, sex, and smoking, the risk of cough among Chinese-Americans remained significant (relative risk 2.63; 95% CI, 2.20–3.15).

- **Conclusions**: We observed that our Chinese group was more than twice as likely as the general population to discontinue lisinopril due to cough, controlling for the influence of sex, age, and smoking.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about the management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treatment of these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and jeopardizing the development of improved treatments.

We advocate a change in emphasis, making a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### Influence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on lower-respiratory tract infections in type 2 diabetes: The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II [^113opb1z]. Diabetes Care (2020). Low credibility.

To determine whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) protect against lower-respiratory tract infections complicating type 2 diabetes, a study was conducted involving 1,732 participants with diabetes. These individuals were recruited to the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2) between 2008 and 2011. Among them, 1,482 had confirmed type 2 diabetes, with a mean age of 65.8 years and a median diabetes duration of 9.0 years; 51.6% were male. Participants were monitored for hospitalizations or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza, retrieved from validated administrative data linkage from study entry to the end of 2016. Cox regression and competing risk regression were utilized to identify independent predictors of this outcome.

Two-thirds of participants (n = 982) were taking an ACEi and/or ARB at study entry (498 [33.6%] ACEi, 408 [27.5%] ARB, 76 [5.1%] both). During 9,511 person-years of follow-up (mean ± SD 6.4 ± 2.0 years), 174 participants experienced incident pneumonia/influenza (156 hospitalizations and 18 deaths without hospitalization). In Cox regression analysis, baseline ACEi/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of incident pneumonia/influenza (cause-specific hazard ratio [HR] 0.64 [95% CI 0.45, 0.89], P = 0.008). Allowing for the competing risk of death did not change this finding (subdistribution HR 0.67 [0.48, 0.95], P = 0.024), and similar reductions were observed for ACEi, ARB alone, and ACEi/ARB combination therapy. There was no significant change in the use of ACEi/ARB during follow-up [interaction with ln(time), P = 0.70].

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: To use or not to use [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients.

In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are not associated with severe COVID-19 infection in a multi-site UK acute hospital trust [^114H17jE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

This project operated under London South East Research Ethics Committee approval (reference 18/LO/2048) granted to the King's Electronic Records Research Interface (KERRI). Specific work on COVID‐19 research was reviewed with expert patient input on a virtual committee with Caldicott Guardian oversight.

- **Study design**: The study cohort was defined as all adult inpatients testing positive for COVID‐19 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital from 1 March to 13 April 2020. Only symptomatic patients who required inpatient admission were included. Presenting symptoms included, but were not limited to, fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, chest pain, or delirium. The primary endpoint was defined as death or admission to a critical care unit for organ support within 21 days of symptom onset. Data were collected for a range of clinical and demographic parameters. To ascertain chronic treatment with ACEi, ARB, and other relevant medications, we captured information from clinical notes, outpatient clinic letters, and inpatient medication orders. If a drug was a regular medication in the community but withheld on admission, we considered this to be on chronic treatment. The primary endpoint was manually verified by clinician review of the electronic health record.

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with the risk of hospitalization and death in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 [^115y2dtA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We constructed cohorts of enrollees for each of the two studies. For the outpatient study, we included individuals aged 18 years or older with six or more months of enrollment in Medicare Advantage or commercial insurance from January through December 2019. These individuals had available claims data, a diagnosis of hypertension in claims, were receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and had a positive test for SARS‐CoV‐2 in an outpatient setting between March 6, 2020, and May 3, 2020. The Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in the study represented all individuals with available claims in the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database who satisfied the inclusion criteria.

For the inpatient study, we identified an inpatient cohort of adults hospitalized with COVID‐19. This cohort included all patients aged 18 years or older, with at least six months of health insurance enrollment in 2019 with available claims data. These patients had a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims, were receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and were hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID‐19 between January 5, 2020, and May 10, 2020.

For both studies, a diagnosis of hypertension was based on ICD‐10 codes, and drug treatment for hypertension was defined by the receipt of one or more agents included in the 2017 American Heart Association hypertension guidelines. These include first-line agents of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers and risk of cancer: Cohort study among people receiving antihypertensive drugs in UK general practice research database [^11431Tw8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We retrieved data on all patients aged ≥ 18 with a first recorded prescription of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the years 1995–2010 inclusive and dated at least six months after the patient's registration date within the General Practice Research Database. Exposure to ACE inhibitors offered an ideal comparison because the two drug classes have similar indications, reducing problems of confounding by indication. ACE inhibitors themselves do not seem to be associated with a risk of cancer.

We chose the six-month period to ensure most included would be new users and to exclude prevalent users with unknown previous treatment duration. ACE inhibitors were defined as all drugs classified in the British National Formulary, chapter 2.5.5.1, and angiotensin receptor blockers as all drugs classified under chapter 2.5.5.2.

Patients were excluded if they had a recorded diagnosis of cancer on or before their index date (defined as the date of their first prescription of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker). To prevent pre-existing cancers from affecting our results, such as through reverse causality, we excluded the initial 12 months of person-time after the first prescription for an angiotensin receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor. Individuals who developed cancer or ended follow-up during this period did not contribute to our analyses. We also excluded patients with any treatment breaks of more than 90 days during this initial qualifying period.

### Antihypertensive medications and risk of community-acquired pneumonia [^113rf7L1]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

To determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other antihypertensives are associated with the risk of pneumonia, we conducted a nested case-control study of incident pneumonia in a subcohort of hypertensive adults insured by several large commercial plans throughout the United States. Individuals with pneumonia were matched on age, sex, region, and subscriber status with up to 10 controls free of pneumonia at the time of case diagnosis. We examined the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors (lipophilic and hydrophilic), angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazides in the prior 3 and 12 months.

A total of 7,429 cases of pneumonia occurred among 305,958 hypertensive individuals. The risk of pneumonia was higher among users of beta-blockers [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.19], calcium channel blockers (adjusted OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.00–1.17), and lipophilic ACE inhibitors (adjusted OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03–1.28) in the preceding 3 months; risks were also higher for use in the preceding 12 months. We observed a lower risk with thiazide use in the preceding 3 months (adjusted OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81–0.99) and hydrophilic ACE inhibitor use in the preceding year (adjusted OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75–0.99).

In this population of middle-aged Americans with hypertension, we observed a modestly higher risk of pneumonia with the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and lipophilic ACE inhibitors. These results are consistent with possible differences in noncardiovascular outcomes among different antihypertensive treatments.

### SPL drug information for perindopril erbumine [^1173ADh6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of perindopril erbumine PO (also known as Aceon):

- **ACE inhibitor-associated cough**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ACEis can cause persistent nonproductive cough.

- **ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and anaphylactoid reactions**: Use caution in all patients, recognizing that Black people have a higher risk of developing angioedema. Discontinue perindopril if angioedema develops.

- **Agranulocytosis and decreased blood neutrophil count**: Use caution in patients with renal impairment, especially in those with a collagen vascular disease, such as SLE or scleroderma.

- **Cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ACEis have been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue perindopril if jaundice or marked elevations of liver enzymes develop.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with volume or salt depletion, such as with prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting, as well as in patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents producing hypotension.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically.

- **Renal failure**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, severe congestive heart failure, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis.

### Risk of pneumonia associated with use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Ws2L5]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

In the second analysis, we carried out adjusted indirect comparisons between the pooled estimate of ACE inhibitors (versus control) and ARBs (versus control) using the Bucher frequentist method, which compares different treatments adjusted to the results of their direct comparison with a common control. This method partially overcomes the problem of different prognostic characteristics between participants among studies, and it is believed to be valid assuming that the relative effect of interventions is consistent across different studies, as verified in our case. By default, we used the random effects model because adjusted indirect comparisons that used the fixed effects model tend to underestimate the standard errors of pooled estimates.

Thirdly, we combined evidence generated by indirect comparisons with evidence from head to head studies comparing ACE inhibitors with ARBs using the random effects model for quantitative pooling, and we determined the discrepancy and heterogeneity between direct and indirect estimates.

We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and 95% confidence intervals, taking into account the baseline risk (weighted proportion of event rate in the control group) because of the differences in the predicted absolute benefit of treatment according to variation in baseline risk between groups. In our case, the weighted risk of pneumonia in the control groups was 4.6% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 6.7%). Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of the asymmetry in funnel plots.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147Q2Ag]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The viral spike coat protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) engages the human ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 cell surface receptor to infect host cells. Thus, concerns arose regarding a theoretically higher risk for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in patients taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We systematically assessed case-population and cohort studies from various databases including MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, Embase, medRXIV, and the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications.

### Comparative first-line effectiveness and safety of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: A multinational cohort study [^1177rS1o]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The study focuses on the comparative first-line effectiveness and safety of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. This multinational cohort study aimed to assess these medications' differential impact on patients with hypertension. The research evaluates clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events, drug-related side effects, and overall patient wellbeing. Findings indicated that there was no significant difference in the primary outcomes between the two drug classes, though specific adverse effects varied. This suggests that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can be considered for initial hypertension treatment, with selection tailored to individual patient characteristics and potential side effects.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111No7cK]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Inclusion criteria for eligible studies were as follows: (1) studies that included patients diagnosed with a chronic refractory cough or unexplained cough according to the cough guidelines proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) or European Respiratory Society (ERS); (2) patients who only received pharmacologic therapies and were followed up for efficacy and/or safety outcomes; (3) studies that reported the estimates of relative risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD); and (4) study design was a comparative RCT (versus placebo or common therapy).

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) refractory chronic cough resulting from potential lung disease such as bronchiectasis or interstitial lung disease; (2) medication directly targeted at an underlying etiology of chronic coughs, such as gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, or upper airway cough syndrome; (3) case reports, letters, comments, conference abstracts, and review articles; (4) the full text was not available; and (5) articles published in languages other than English.

The search results were screened based on two independent authors' relevant titles and abstracts. All discordant results were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer.

The following data were extracted from eligible studies and recorded in a standardised pro forma sheet: names of the author, year of publication, region, and centre, type of literature, sample size, gender and age of the participants, race, and BMI of the participants.

### Cough and ACE inhibitors: The truth beyond placebo [^114kQ7mD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are extensively used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a wide range of clinical recommendations. The use of ACE inhibitors can cause the onset of a dry cough, whose prevalence has probably been overestimated due to the lack of adequate control. A correct interpretation of available data requires a careful evaluation of placebo-controlled studies to definitively assess the rate of the most frequent adverse event of ACE inhibition.

### Risk of pneumonia associated with use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112SwWGg]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, we found that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with control treatment and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); the magnitude of this reduction (about one-third) was similar across studies with different designs, including randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies. The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure. Most of the potential protective benefits from ACE inhibitors seemed to be in Asian patients; it is unclear whether the methodology of the studies or the clinical and genetic characteristics of the patients were responsible for this finding. The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia; it is uncertain if differences exist between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for this outcome.

The present review was designed to determine the effect of treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs on the risk of pneumonia. We combined data from both experimental and observational studies to obtain more robust results, mainly because no randomized controlled trial was primarily designed with this objective. Pneumonia is not a rare outcome, particularly in populations treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or an outcome that only occurs months to years after use of these medications. Therefore, randomized controlled trials should be designed in the future with this objective in mind.

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^116q3BMN]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to general principles, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating and managing adult patients with chronic cough based on the most common causes, including upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, GERD, and laryngopharyngeal reflux.

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use with COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality [^112dPR5D]. JAMA (2020). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may make patients more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lead to worse outcomes through upregulation of the functional receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

The objective of this study was to examine whether the use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

To examine outcomes among patients with COVID-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from the day of diagnosis to outcome or the end of the study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between the use of ACEI/ARBs versus other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020.

ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis.

In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years).

### Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? A questionnaire survey in different medical categories [^112Go5F5]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are generally considered safe, but they are associated with characteristic side effects, such as cough and angioedema, which often require discontinuation. The frequency of referrals for these side effects appears to be increasing, prompting an evaluation of the level of knowledge about ACE-I safety among different medical professions.

A questionnaire consisting of 13 questions about the side effects of ACE-I was distributed to physicians.

The study was conducted in the context of everyday clinical practice.

Participants included cardiologists, allergists, and general practitioners (GPs) from the National Healthcare System.

A total of 312 physicians were contacted, and 154 returned questionnaires were suitable for analysis. Among these 154 physicians, with a mean age of 45 years, 48 were cardiologists, 52 were GPs, and 54 were allergists. The overall percentage of correct answers was low: 31.9% for cardiologists, 40% for GPs, and 33% for allergists. General practitioners provided a significantly higher percentage of correct answers compared to the other categories (p = 0.05). The topics with the lowest correct response rates (0 to 15.9%) included the time of onset of cough and the appropriate course of action. Cardiologists particularly seemed to lack awareness that angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) can cross-react with ACE-I.

In conclusion, there was an overall lack of knowledge regarding the side effects of ACE-I, which may explain the increased number of referrals for chronic cough and angioedema.

### Risk of pneumonia associated with use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114bERyd]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The systematic review was conducted according to the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statements. Our primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia, considering cases of pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, and admissions to hospital due to lower respiratory tract infections. Data were extracted irrespective of whether they had been reported as predefined outcomes or as adverse effects. To avoid duplication, if studies reported data for death from pneumonia only, we did not consider these cases for the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was pneumonia-related mortality, defined as death directly related to this condition or in-hospital death or mortality within 30 days after onset of pneumonia. For both outcomes, we did not consider undefined data or data on upper respiratory tract infections.

We considered randomized controlled parallel trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies with ACE inhibitors or ARBs as interventions and with predefined outcomes. Treatment arms could compare ACE inhibitors and ARBs with each other or with a placebo or any other active drug. Cohort studies could be based on populations in the community or those in institutions or hospitals and had to follow patients to determine pneumonia outcomes.

In case-control studies, cases had to be defined as patients with new onset pneumonia identified through clinical examination, radiological methods, or database codes. Controls had to be matched to cases, but without new onset pneumonia.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112BzfjR]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

A dry, persistent cough is a well-described class effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications. The mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough remains unresolved but likely involves the protussive mediators bradykinin and substance P. These agents are degraded by ACE and therefore accumulate in the upper respiratory tract or lung when the enzyme is inhibited. Prostaglandins, whose production may be stimulated by bradykinin, might also contribute to this mechanism.

- **Methods**: Data for this review were obtained from a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, conducted in May 2004. The search focused on literature published in the English language from 1985 to 2004, using the terms "angiotensin-converting enzyme", "angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors", and "cough".

- **Results**: The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough has been reported to range from 5 to 35% among patients treated with these agents. A much lower incidence has been described in studies of patients presenting for the evaluation of chronic cough. The onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough can occur within hours of the first dose or months after the initiation of therapy. Typically, resolution occurs within 1 to 4 weeks after cessation of therapy, though the cough may persist for up to 3 months. The only uniformly effective treatment for this type of cough is discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. The incidence of cough associated with therapy using angiotensin-receptor blockers appears to be similar to that of the control drug. In a minority of patients, cough may persist.
