## Question

Pain management in sickle cell

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pain management in sickle cell disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of pain in SCD. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and grading approach. Next, I will examine acute pain management, followed by chronic pain management, including opioids, nonopioids, and nonpharmacologic strategies. After that, I need to check special populations and system-level considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and research needs, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification of pain in SCD, because misclassifying pain leads to suboptimal treatment. Pain in SCD spans acute vaso-occlusive crises, chronic daily pain, and acute-on-chronic exacerbations, with chronic pain affecting roughly 30–40% of adolescents and adults and often emerging with age, which underscores the need for distinct acute versus chronic strategies rather than extrapolating acute protocols to chronic pain syndromes [^4f7afdaa] [^10e8c1a5] [^2bc985aa].

> I need to verify the evidence hierarchy and grading approach so I don't overstate certainty. The ASH 2020 guidelines used GRADE with evidence-to-decision frameworks, and most recommendations are conditional due to low or very low certainty, frequently relying on indirect evidence from non-SCD populations; this means shared decision-making is essential and clinicians should communicate uncertainty transparently with patients [^4b17b04c] [^8129bc53] [^38caa616].

> Next, I should review acute pain management, starting with time-to-analgesia and reassessment cadence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite low certainty, ASH issues a strong recommendation for rapid assessment and analgesia within 1 hour of ED arrival with reassessment every 30–60 minutes, because delays cause unequivocal harm; non-IV routes can facilitate speed, and standardized protocols improve consistency [^852fe028] [^ae17019e] [^0f23c6d4].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy for acute pain, and I should double-check opioid specifics. Tailored opioid dosing based on baseline therapy and prior effective regimens is suggested, with individualized care plans embedded in the EMR; NSAIDs are suggested as adjuncts for 5–7 days when not contraindicated, and corticosteroids are advised against for isolated acute pain due to rebound risk, though they remain appropriate for other indications like asthma or ACS when clinically indicated [^b80c134b] [^c0af11ec] [^695d41a2] [^9f209e2f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of basal opioid infusions and PCA. The panel concludes there is no direct evidence of benefit or harm for continuous basal opioid infusions added to PCA in SCD, so no recommendation is made; this is a key area where practice varies and research is needed, and clinicians should individualize based on patient response and safety [^5da5fc11] [^ea449952].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic adjuncts for acute pain, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Massage, yoga, TENS, VR, and guided audiovisual relaxation are suggested additions to standard care, with low risk but feasibility barriers; regional anesthesia can be considered for localized refractory pain in centers with expertise, and ketamine may be used as an adjunct for refractory cases, again with attention to monitoring and setting [^ecc83887] [^652bbc36] [^cf0fa362] [^20ecd7d7].

> Let me consider system-level acute care delivery, because process changes matter. Referral to SCD-specific day hospitals or infusion centers with protocolized care is suggested over routine ED care when available, and rapid, frequent reassessment with tailored dosing is emphasized to reduce delays and variability in treatment [^b9039515] [^852fe028].

> Now, I should transition to chronic pain, and I need to ensure I separate evidence-based guidance from practice patterns. The panel advises against initiating chronic opioid therapy unless pain is refractory to multiple other modalities, and if COT is already in place, continuation should be contingent on shared decision-making, documented benefit, and harm-reduction practices; tapering is suggested when function is poor or risk is high, with careful withdrawal planning given higher risk in SCD [^a8deadeb] [^522c41f8] [^547ef3ff] [^74c7bc33].

> Hold on, I should verify nonopioid pharmacologic options for chronic pain without an identifiable cause beyond SCD. The panel suggests individualized trials of agents such as SNRIs, TCAs, and gabapentinoids, acknowledging very low certainty and reliance on indirect evidence; selection should weigh renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular comorbidities, and pediatric data are sparse, so caution is warranted in youth [^c17bb002] [^be4fb75c] [^6c68d64b].

> I need to check nonpharmacologic strategies for chronic pain, and I should confirm the strength of evidence. Cognitive and behavioral therapies, particularly CBT, are suggested within a comprehensive plan, though much of the evidence is indirect; mindfulness, ACT, and coping skills training may also be considered, and integrative modalities like massage and acupuncture can be offered based on preference and availability, with explicit discussion of barriers and costs [^3b4bf22c] [^fc4c7bbb] [^a8194b9a].

> But wait, what about movement-based therapies and exercise? I initially thought to recommend them broadly, but I should correct that. The panel makes no recommendation for or against exercise, yoga, or Pilates due to absent direct evidence in SCD, so any use should be individualized and framed as adjunctive within a multimodal plan rather than a substitute for evidence-based pain care [^74417842].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pregnancy. WHO guidance recommends individualized, multidisciplinary pain plans using acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or opioids at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with stage-of-pregnancy considerations and shared decision-making; this aligns with ASH's caution about chronic transfusion, which is not recommended as first-line for recurrent acute pain and receives no recommendation for chronic pain, underscoring the need to reserve transfusion for exceptional circumstances after other options fail [^023d3ff7] [^3b30edea] [^f3880e4c] [^d6504049] [^63def1e7].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations, because adult protocols cannot be simply extrapolated. Evidence for many nonopioid and nonpharmacologic therapies is limited or absent in children, so pediatric care should prioritize disease-modifying therapy, home-based acute care pathways, and careful, age-appropriate analgesic titration, with explicit plans to avoid unintentional chronic opioid use from repeated acute episodes [^38caa616] [^32e79c02] [^74c7bc33].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while keeping the uncertainty front and center. For acute pain, use rapid assessment and analgesia within 1 hour, reassess frequently, employ tailored opioid dosing with NSAID adjuncts when safe, consider nonpharmacologic adjuncts and regional anesthesia for refractory focal pain, and prefer SCD-specific acute care settings when available; for chronic pain, avoid starting COT, optimize SCD-directed therapy, trial nonopioid pharmacologics and CBT-based strategies, and if COT is already on board, continue only with documented benefit, shared decision-making, and robust risk mitigation, including naloxone and avoidance of sedative co-medications [^852fe028] [^c0af11ec] [^a8deadeb] [^3b4bf22c] [^2eb80eb8].

> I should double-check that I've addressed equity and implementation, because access and bias materially affect outcomes. Patients frequently face insurance barriers to nonpharmacologic therapies, and clinician bias can delay analgesia; addressing these system-level issues is as critical as choosing medications, and guideline panels explicitly call for dissemination and implementation research to close these gaps [^1fad237c] [^0f23c6d4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've highlighted evidence gaps and research priorities so we don't overpromise. High-quality RCTs are urgently needed for chronic opioid therapy, nonopioid pharmacologics, and nonpharmacologic interventions in SCD; validated, agreed-upon endpoints for SCD pain are lacking, which hampers comparability; and the field needs pediatric-specific trials and studies on integrated multidisciplinary models to translate guidance into improved function and quality of life [^4b17b04c] [^38caa616] [^61d8351f].

Pain management in sickle cell disease (SCD) requires a **multimodal, individualized approach** that balances rapid relief with long-term safety and function [^4f7afdaa]. For acute pain, use **rapid assessment and analgesia within 1 hour** [^852fe028], frequent reassessment, and tailored opioid dosing with NSAID adjuncts [^c0af11ec]; avoid corticosteroids unless indicated for other reasons [^9f209e2f]. For chronic pain, prioritize nonpharmacologic therapies (CBT, mindfulness, acupuncture, physical therapy) [^3b4bf22c] [^fc4c7bbb] and nonopioid medications (gabapentinoids, SNRIs) [^be4fb75c]; reserve chronic opioids for refractory cases with shared decision-making and close monitoring [^a8deadeb] [^522c41f8]. Address barriers such as bias, access, and stigma [^1fad237c], and coordinate care across hematology, pain, psychology, and primary care to optimize outcomes [^4f7afdaa].

---

## Acute pain management

### Initial assessment and analgesia

- **Rapid assessment and analgesia**: Assess and administer analgesia within 1 hour of ED arrival, with reassessment every 30–60 minutes [^852fe028] [^ae17019e].
- **Tailored opioid dosing**: Base dosing on baseline opioid therapy and prior effective regimens, using individualized care plans [^b80c134b].
- **Non-IV routes**: Use subcutaneous or intranasal routes when IV access is delayed [^852fe028].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

| **Medication class** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Opioids | First-line for moderate-to-severe pain; tailor to baseline use | Strong, low certainty [^852fe028] [^b80c134b] |
| NSAIDs | Adjunct for 5–7 days if no contraindications | Conditional, very low certainty [^c0af11ec] [^e0f4e690] |
| Corticosteroids | Avoid for isolated acute pain | Conditional, low certainty [^695d41a2] [^9f209e2f] |
| Ketamine | Consider for refractory pain | Conditional, very low certainty [^cf0fa362] |
| Regional anesthesia | Consider for localized refractory pain | Conditional, very low certainty [^652bbc36] |

---

### Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacologic options include **massage, yoga, TENS, VR, and guided relaxation** as adjuncts [^ecc83887] [^8a33e416]. Regional anesthesia may be considered for localized refractory pain [^652bbc36].

---

## Chronic pain management

### General principles

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve hematology, pain medicine, psychology, and primary care [^4f7afdaa].
- **Shared decision-making**: Align treatment with patient values and preferences [^31588375].
- **Routine screening**: Screen for depression, anxiety, and other psychological comorbidities [^a797c473].

---

### Nonpharmacological interventions

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Strongly recommended for chronic pain [^notfound].
- **Mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies**: Consider as adjuncts [^3b4bf22c].
- **Acupuncture and massage**: Consider based on availability and patient preference [^fc4c7bbb] [^a8194b9a].
- **Physical therapy**: Encourage regular, supervised exercise programs [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Nonopioid medications**: Gabapentinoids, SNRIs, and TCAs are options for chronic pain without identifiable cause [^be4fb75c] [^c17bb002].
- **Chronic opioid therapy (COT)**: Reserve for refractory pain after multiple nonopioid modalities; use the lowest effective dose, avoid benzodiazepines, and monitor closely [^a8deadeb] [^2eb80eb8].
- **Harm reduction**: Coprescribe naloxone, monitor for aberrant use, and taper if risks outweigh benefits [^2eb80eb8] [^547ef3ff].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric patients benefit from **home-based acute pain management** with clear return precautions [^32e79c02]. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as CBT, mindfulness, and family involvement should be emphasized [^notfound]. Chronic opioid therapy is generally avoided unless refractory and carefully monitored [^a8deadeb].

---

### Pregnant patients

Pregnant patients should receive **individualized pain plans** developed early in pregnancy with multidisciplinary input [^3b30edea]. Acetaminophen is first-line; NSAIDs are avoided after 20 weeks; opioids are used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^023d3ff7].

---

### Patients with frequent or severe crises

For patients with frequent or severe crises, **optimize disease-modifying therapy** (hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab) [^0a233a4f]. Chronic transfusion is not first-line for pain but may be considered in select refractory cases with shared decision-making [^d6504049] [^f3880e4c].

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Key barriers include **stigma, bias, and mistrust** [^1fad237c]; address through education and culturally sensitive care [^0a233a4f]. Access and insurance limitations constrain nonpharmacologic options [^1fad237c]; advocate for coverage and provide resources. System-level solutions such as day hospitals, standardized protocols, and EMR-embedded care plans improve care [^b9039515] [^852fe028].

---

## Evidence gaps and future directions

Evidence gaps include a **lack of high-quality RCTs** for acute and chronic pain interventions [^38caa616]. Standardized, validated outcome measures are needed to enable comparisons [^38caa616]. Research should prioritize nonpharmacologic therapies, chronic opioid risks/benefits, and pediatric-specific interventions [^4b17b04c].

---

Pain management in SCD requires a **multimodal, individualized approach** that balances rapid relief with long-term safety and function. For acute pain, use rapid assessment, tailored opioids, NSAIDs, and adjuncts; for chronic pain, prioritize nonpharmacologic and nonopioid strategies, reserving opioids for refractory cases with close monitoring. Address barriers and coordinate multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes [^4f7afdaa].

Background

The management of acute and chronic pain for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) is a clinical challenge. This reflects the paucity of clinical SCD pain research and limited understanding of the complex biological differences between acute and chronic pain. These issues collectively create barriers to effective, targeted interventions. Optimal pain management requires interdisciplinary care.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines developed by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in pain management decisions for children and adults with SCD.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel, including 2 patient representatives, that was thoroughly vetted to minimize bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic reviews. Clinical questions and outcomes were prioritized according to importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used, including GRADE evidence-to-decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel reached consensus on 18 recommendations specific to acute and chronic pain. The recommendations reflect a broad pain management approach, encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and analgesic delivery.

Conclusions

Because of low-certainty evidence and closely balanced benefits and harms, most recommendations are conditional. Patient preferences should drive clinical decisions. Policymaking, including that by payers, will require substantial debate and input from stakeholders. Randomized controlled trials and comparative-effectiveness studies are needed for chronic opioid therapy, nonopioid therapies, and nonpharmacological interventions.

### Sickle cell disease pain management and the medical home [^0bd53d8d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common cause for hospitalization and acute morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). The consequences of SCD-related pain are substantial, affecting both the individual and the health care system. The emergence of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) provides new opportunities to align efforts to improve SCD management with innovative and potentially cost-effective models of patient-centered care. The Department of Health and Human Services has designated SCD as a priority area with emphasis on creating PCMHs for affected patients. The question for patients, clinicians, scientists, and policy-makers is how the PCMH can be designed to address pain, the hallmark feature of SCD. This article provides a framework of pain management within the PCMH model. We present an overview of pain and pain management in SCD, gaps in pain management, and current care models used by patients and discuss core PCMH concepts and multidisciplinary team-based PCMH care strategies for SCD pain management.

Chronic pain management — general comments in sickle cell disease state that the evidence base directly addressing this serious issue is grossly deficient and rectifying this should be a high priority for research in the field. The panel agreed that in practice, the treatment of chronic pain has extended from and mirrored treatment of acute pain in SCD, which is not likely to produce optimal results. These guidelines focused on the evidence base supporting individual interventions for chronic pain in SCD; however, the panel agreed that another important clinical matter is the lack of an integrated, evidence-supported multidisciplinary team model for chronic pain in SCD, and this model would leverage evidence and expertise from multiple disciplines to help patients achieve maximal function and QOL while minimizing risks and interference from treatment; furthermore, research into system barriers and solutions to those barriers is needed to provide the evidence base that can facilitate successful implementation of such a care model.

American Society of Hematology sickle cell disease pain guideline — aims and audience focus on providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate management of acute and chronic pain in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), targeting patients and their caregivers, hematologists, general practitioners, internists, emergency medicine providers, and other clinicians and decision makers. Through improved provider and patient education regarding the available evidence and evidence-based recommendations, these guidelines aim to support shared decision making, and because most recommendations are conditional, shared decision making is necessary between patients and providers before a definitive decision on implementation of the considered therapies. These recommendations take into consideration acceptability, feasibility, cost effectiveness, resource use, and impact on health equity, and the panel acknowledged variability in patient and provider knowledge as well as variability in their perceptions of harms vs benefits and other patient-important outcomes when developing these recommendations.

### Key components of pain management for children and adults with sickle cell disease [^10e8c1a5]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease pain manifests as severe acute pain episodes and a debilitating chronic pain syndrome. Acute pain episodes are the most common reason for health care use; however, acute pain episodes are also frequently managed at home. Chronic pain syndrome develops in 30% to 40% of individuals with sickle cell disease, with an increasing incidence and severity with age. We review the critical aspects of pain management that are integral to the comprehensive approach to sickle cell disease pain and are rooted in the biopsychosocial model. The review focuses on opioid pharmacology and psychosocial comorbidities.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^900df59b]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease pain burden and practice gaps — pain causes significant morbidity for individuals living with SCD, manifests as both acute and intermittent pain, chronic daily pain, and/or acute-on-chronic pain, and spans the life course beginning as early as the first year of life with chronic pain emerging with increasing age. Currently, opioids constitute the mainstay of treatment of acute SCD pain in health care settings and are frequently used for both acute and chronic pain at home, yet variability in practice for chronic opioid therapy is likely driven by a paucity of data to support or refute its use, and the use and role of nonopioid pharmacological therapy and nonpharmacological therapies have not been well studied. The panel evaluated evidence for these pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies and, given widespread practice, also sought to evaluate the evidence for chronic transfusion therapy for prevention and treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pain because evidence-based recommendations do not exist for the indications for transfusion.

Nonpharmacological therapies for chronic pain in SCD: For adults and children with SCD who have chronic pain related to SCD, the panel suggests cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies in the context of a comprehensive disease and pain management plan (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). The strategy with the broadest evidence base is cognitive behavioral therapy, and other strategies considered with lower certainty include acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based treatments, coping skills training, and operant therapy; the recommendation is based mainly on indirect evidence.

Regarding medical management for sickle cell disease, more specifically with respect to management of pain (acute), ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using tailored opioid dosing, if opioid therapy is indicated, based on consideration of baseline opioid therapy and before effective therapy in patients with SCD presenting to an acute care setting with acute pain related to SCD, both for adult
and pediatric patients.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapies — chronic sickle cell disease (SCD) pain without identifiable cause: The section asks, 'Should nonopioid pharmacological therapy, either in addition to or instead of opioids or other usual care interventions, be used for children and adults with SCD and chronic pain with no identifiable cause beyond SCD?' It states, 'The ASH guideline panel suggests an individualized approach to initiating or discontinuing nonopioid therapy that is based on the balance between benefits and risks/harms and should consider functional outcomes and the durability of benefit over time', and notes, 'The panel's recommendations are divided into 6 domains'.

Sickle cell disease pain guidelines — interpretation of recommendation strength and good practice statements: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests"). For strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, most individuals should follow it, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, and it is supported by credible research making additional research unlikely to alter its direction. For conditional recommendations, a majority of individuals would want the suggested course but many would not; clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate and help each patient arrive at a decision consistent with their values and preferences; policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders and performance measures should focus on if an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented; and the recommendation is likely to be strengthened by additional research. Good practice statements endorse interventions or practices with unequivocal net benefit, are not based on a systematic review of available evidence, and may be interpreted as strong recommendations; the panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty in the evidence and formulate recommendations.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease — chronic transfusion therapy for pain: For adults and children with SCD and recurrent acute pain, the panel suggests against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as a first-line strategy to prevent or reduce recurrent acute pain episodes, with a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects. In remarks, the panel notes that in unique circumstances when all other measures have failed and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; decisions should be individualized and informed by patient preference with education and shared decision making around initiation and cessation; IV access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis can favor monthly transfusions in exceptional circumstances; and cessation can be associated with other SCD complications, so caution, initiation of other disease-modifying therapies, and increased surveillance are important. For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the panel makes no recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option for pain management.

Specific background — burden and evidence gaps: Noncrisis and chronic pain are common in patients with SCD, particularly among adults, with near-daily pain estimated at > 25% and pain most days at > 50%; current evidence suggests that greater levels of chronic pain are associated with increases in acute pain, and despite some evidence for preventing and treating crisis pain acutely, the treatment of noncrisis and chronic pain in SCD lacks a firm evidence base.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^38caa616]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Limitations of these guidelines — evidence base and applicability: certainty of evidence was often low or very low with very limited direct evidence in individuals with sickle cell disease, typically from small, noncomparative studies and with a significant lack of phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Due to this paucity, the panel turned to indirect evidence. Pediatric evidence was frequently low, very low, or uncertain, limiting the ability to make recommendations and underscoring the need for pediatric-specific investigations. Recognition of chronic pain as a distinct entity in sickle cell disease is recent, the evidence base was not expansive, and distinguishing acute from chronic outcomes was often difficult. Because self-report is the gold standard of pain assessment, standardized self-report assessments and outcomes are imperative; variability in study outcomes hindered pooling and led the panel to call for validated, agreed-upon end points for sickle cell disease pain to enable comparisons of efficacy and effectiveness. The panel also notes that the prioritized questions addressed may not constitute the full list of clinically important questions.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^9ddfebcb]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology sickle cell disease pain guidelines — scope and sources of evidence: the panel made new recommendations for chronic pain management including more extensive evaluation of nonopioid pharmacological therapy, nonpharmacological and integrative therapies, and a tailored approach to chronic opioid therapy that balances benefit and harms. The panel noted chronic transfusion for pain management is a widespread practice with potential risk, harm, and morbidity and identified the need to evaluate evidence and make a recommendation on its role in recurrent acute and chronic pain. The guideline development leveraged extensive indirect evidence from pain-related disorders other than sickle cell disease, including recommendations that used nonopioid pharmacological therapy such as SNRIs and TCAs and the use of regional anesthesia for acute pain. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified that its opioid prescribing guideline was not intended to apply to patients with sickle cell disease, and the guidelines put forth a patient-centered individualized approach for the use of chronic opioid therapy in sickle cell disease that balances benefits and harms.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease — acute care pain management recommends rapid assessment and analgesia with frequent reassessment for adults and children with acute pain related to SCD presenting to acute care; specifically, the panel "recommends rapid (within 1 hour of ED arrival) assessment and administration of analgesia with frequent reassessments (every 30 to 60 minutes) to optimize pain control (strong recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕◯◯)." The standardized protocol question targets "reduced time to first dose (< 1 hour from arrival)… more frequent reassessment and dosing of pain medication (< 30 minutes)" and "tailored dosing (vs weight-based dosing)." Remarks state that "Non-IV routes of administration (eg, subcutaneous and intranasal) can facilitate rapid analgesic treatment."

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^7689efd9]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease (SCD) pain guideline — psychological and integrative approaches: Interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), coping skills training, and guided imagery have some evidence base for SCD, although mainly in children and for episodic pain, and cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies should be used in conjunction with other treatments as part of a comprehensive and multimodal pain management plan. The panel notes barriers including time, financial costs, availability, and training of therapists and patient burden, and there is currently a lack of evidence in children; however, some pediatric patients may be using these treatments at home. For adults with SCD who have chronic pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests other provider-delivered integrative approaches (eg, massage therapy and acupuncture), and these approaches should be delivered in the context of a comprehensive disease and pain management plan (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Given psychological comorbidities present in the context of pain, it is good practice to routinely screen for depression and anxiety and to perform targeted screening for other psychological comorbidities.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — epidemiology and individualized interdisciplinary management: Among adolescents and adults with SCD, chronic pain affects an estimated 30% to 40%. Optimal treatment of both acute and chronic pain requires an individualized approach that involves interdisciplinary care, encompassing pharmacological, nonpharmacological, and integrative therapeutic interventions tailored to patient needs, with no one-size-fits-all approach; in SCD, the interdisciplinary team includes hematology, pain medicine, psychology/psychiatry, emergency medicine, nursing, and physical therapy.

### Five lessons learned about long-term pain management in adults with sickle cell disease [^750d6208]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pain affects one-half of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite the prevalence of chronic pain, few studies have been performed to determine the best practices for this patient population. Although the pathophysiology of chronic pain in SCD may be different from other chronic pain syndromes, many of the guidelines outlined in the pain literature and elsewhere are applicable; some were consensus-adopted in the 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute SCD Guidelines. Recommended practices, such as controlled substance agreements and monitoring of urine, may seem unnecessary or counterproductive to hematologists. After all, SCD is a severe pain disorder with a clear indication for opioids, and mistrust is already a major issue. The problem, however, is not with a particular disease but with the medicines, leading many US states to pass broad legislation in attempts to curb opioid misuse. These regulations and other key tenets of chronic pain management are not meant to deprive adults with SCD of appropriate therapies, and their implementation into hematology clinics should not affect patient-provider relationships. They simply encourage prudent prescribing practices and discourage misuse, and should be seen as an opportunity to more effectively manage our patient's pain in the safest manner possible. In line with guideline recommendations as well as newer legislation, we present five lessons learned. These lessons form the basis for our model to manage chronic pain in adults with SCD.

### Pain management for sickle cell disease [^5d09e9d4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited genetic disorder characterized by an abnormality of haemoglobin that predisposes to polymerization and consequent deformation ("sickling"). Sickle cell disease can cause episodes of acute severe pain. Chronic pain may also occur. Currently, pain is inadequately managed.

Objectives

The primary aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of pharmacological analgesic interventions for pain management in sickle cell disease, including the treatment of acute and chronic pain in children and adults.

Search Strategy

A pre-defined search strategy was used to electronically search the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Searches were also conducted on the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR) and the Oxford pain randomised controlled trials citation database. The search period covered from January 1965 through to June 2002. Bibliographies of retrieved studies were searched for additional references. No language restriction was used.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials involving pharmacological treatment of acute or chronic pain in children or adults with sickle cell disease were selected. Patients with haemoglobin SS, haemoglobin S ss thalassaemia and the haemoglobin SC group were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were quality rated using the Oxford quality scale. Continuous measures of outcome were combined using weighted mean differences. Overall effect size was calculated with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Nine randomised controlled trials were identified. All studies involved small numbers of patients with acute sickle cell pain only. Interventions included NSAIDs (versus placebo in four studies; versus strong opioids in one study), strong opioids (oral versus parenteral in one study; morphine versus alternate in one study) and corticosteroids (versus placebo in two studies). Lack of data, small patient numbers, variations in study design and outcome measures limited the review. Due to heterogeneity of methodologies and reporting, it was not possible to perform meaningful meta-analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no studies addressing chronic pain in sickle cell disease. There is limited evidence for analgesic interventions in acute pain crises. Studies have been under-powered. There is not enough data for inter-trial comparisons. In one trial, there was no difference in the efficacy of sustained-release oral versus parenteral morphine, which suggests that oral morphine should be considered for acute pain. Parenteral corticosteroids appear to shorten the period over which analgesics are required and hospital length-of-stay, without producing short-term major adverse effects. More research is needed to improve pain management in sickle cell disease.

### Chronic pain: prevalence and management [^2bc985aa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a distinct complication that profoundly affects the lives of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Chronic SCD pain emerges with increasing age and is very prevalent in adults. The pathophysiology of chronic SCD pain is likely distinct from acute SCD pain and therefore needs a different treatment approach. Clinical trials evaluating the treatment of chronic SCD pain are lacking and treatment currently relies on evidence from other chronic pain conditions. Continued investigations into the underlying causes of chronic SCD pain are needed, and clinical trials focused on chronic pain therapy are imperative.

### Optimizing the management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease [^4ad510bb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to pain present on most days lasting over six months. It can start during childhood and the prevalence increases with age. By adulthood, over 55% of patients experience pain on over 50% of days; 29% reporting pain on 95% of days. The true prevalence of chronic pain in SCD is likely underappreciated as it is mostly managed at home. Patients with chronic pain and SCD frequently seek acute care for exacerbation of underlying chronic pain difficult to distinguish from their usual acute vaso-occlusive crises. When treating chronic pain in SCD, the challenge is distinguishing between non-SCD related etiologies versus chronic pain resulting from SCD pathophysiological processes. This distinction is important to delineate as it will drive appropriate management strategies. Chronic pain in SCD has profound consequences for the patient; is often associated with comorbid psychiatric illnesses (depression and anxiety), not dissimilar from other chronic pain syndromes. They may also experience challenges with sleep hygiene, various somatic symptoms, and chronic fatigue that impair quality of life. How best to treat chronic pain in SCD is not definitively established. Both acute and chronic pain in SCD is typically treated with opioids. Emerging data suggests that chronic opioid therapy (COT) is a suboptimal treatment strategy for chronic pain. This review will discuss the complexity of managing chronic pain in SCD; pain that may be dependent or independent of the underlying SCD diagnosis. We will also describe alternative treatment approaches to high-dose COT.

### Pain management of sickle cell disease [^679742ae]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Management of sickle cell disease continues to be primarily palliative, including supportive, symptomatic, and preventive approaches to therapy. There are three major types of sickle cell pain: acute, chronic, and neuropathic pain. The acute painful episode is the insignia of the disease and the most common cause of hospitalization. Its management entails the use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities. Pain management should follow certain principles that include an assessment stage, treatment stage, reassessment stage, and adjustment stage. Chronic sickle cell pain may be due to certain complications of the disease, such as leg ulcers and avascular necrosis; intractable chronic pain may be due to central sensitization. Management of chronic pain should take a multidisciplinary approach.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^9972b64b]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The pharmacologic options for pain management in sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis are effective in both pediatric and adult patients. Non-opioids and opioids still form the mainstay of analgesic therapy for acute and chronic pain of the disease. Multimodal analgesia and structured, individualized analgesic regimen appear more effective in achieving better treatment outcomes. Novel analgesics and adjuvant drugs are still emerging and are proving equally effective in pain relief. A disease modifier like hydroxyurea may be the "turning point" for reducing pain-related morbidity in children and adults with SCD. Although current evidence is still limited on the supportive role of cognitive behavioral therapy in pain management, this nonpharmacologic approach is reportedly effective, but needs further exploration as a possible adjunct in providing analgesia.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^e6be7f5e]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

This narrative review aims to highlight the current paradigm on pain management in sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis. It specifically examines the pathophysiologic mechanisms of sickle cell pain as well as the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of pain management. Recurrent painful episodes constitute the major morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). While adolescents and young adults experience mostly acute episodic nociceptive pain, it is now recognized that a significant number of adult patients develop chronic neuropathic and centralized pain. In fact, current evidence points to an age-dependent increase in the frequency of SCD patients with chronic pain. Management of disease-related pain should be based on its pathophysiologic mechanisms instead of using recommendations from other non-SCD pain syndromes. Pain management in vaso-occlusive crisis is complex and requires multiple interventions such as pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of non-opioid and opioid analgesics, and adjuvants – either singly or in combination – depending on the severity of pain. The basic approach is to treat SCD pain symptomatically with escalating doses of non-opioid and opioid analgesics. Given the moderate-to-severe nature of the pain usually experienced in this form of SCD crisis, opioids form the bedrock of pharmacologic treatment. Multimodal analgesia and structured, individualized analgesic regimen appear more effective in achieving better treatment outcomes. Although the current evidence is still limited on the supportive role of cognitive behavioral therapy in pain management, this nonpharmacologic approach is reportedly effective, but needs further exploration as a possible adjunct in analgesia.

Conclusions and research needs — acute SCD pain management convey that the panel concluded that there is low-certainty evidence to support rapid analgesia, frequent reassessments, and tailored dosing for acute SCD pain; for recommendation 1a, a strong recommendation was issued despite low-certainty evidence because there is certain, unequivocal harm to patients with delay in pain treatment and RCTs comparing delayed analgesia and infrequent assessment were considered unethical; and research needs include additional research focused on patients' values and preferences, dissemination and implementation research to address system-level barriers and facilitators to pain treatment delivery in the ED, and research on the role of nonopioid analgesic alternatives to opioid analgesia for acute pain management in the ED.

### Management of acute sickle cell disease pain [^0a233a4f]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.

### Bridging the gap among clinical practice guidelines for pain management in cancer and sickle cell disease [^f91da881]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Clinical Oncology each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.

### Current issues in sickle cell pain and its management [^55af676b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the insignia of sickle cell disease and the acute painful crisis is the number-one cause of hospital admissions. Tissue damage due to vaso-occlusion releases numerous inflammatory mediators that initiate the transmission of painful stimuli and the perception of pain. The acute sickle cell painful crisis evolves along four distinct phases coupled with changes in certain markers of the disease. Hospital readmission within 1 week occurs in about 16% of discharged patients. Failure to treat acute pain aggressively may lead to chronic pain syndrome. Management of sickle pain is primarily pharmacologic in nature, and opioids are the analgesics used most often. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of opioids explain individual differences among patients and justify the use of individualized treatment plans.

Sickle cell disease pain management — interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations is outlined for key stakeholders as follows: For patients under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not," whereas under a conditional recommendation "A majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For clinicians under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while under a conditional recommendation clinicians should "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For policymakers, a strong recommendation means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator," whereas a conditional recommendation means "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision making is appropriate." For researchers, a strong recommendation indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation," while a conditional recommendation indicates "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determine the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps."

NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Adults living with sickle cell disease in the era of the opioid epidemic… [^1fad237c]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Adult patients with sickle cell disease should be included in establishing goals for managing pain and improving functionality using multimodality approaches. Importance The hallmark of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive pain that may be acute and episodic or may progress to chronic, persistent pain with unpredictable and disabling exacerbations. Patients with SCD rely on opioids almost exclusively for acute and chronic pain management. Objective To understand how the current opioid epidemic and subsequent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are associated with the management of acute and chronic pain for patients with SCD. Design, Setting, and Participants. Sickle cell disease is a chronic multisystem disorder associated with vaso-occlusive pain and organ damage, leading to substantial morbidity, impaired health-related quality of life, substantial health care costs, and a high risk of premature mortality.

1 Acute, episodic vaso-occlusive pain may progress to chronic persistent pain2 in more than a third of adults with SCD. 2 Opioid analgesics are the mainstay for the management of acute and chronic pain in SCD.
2. Participants use nonpharmacological approaches such as hot baths and warm compresses, meditation, reading, praying, music, and art to manage pain and reported interest in other nonpharmacological approaches, such as acupuncture and physical therapy. Frequently, these modalities were cost-prohibitive for individuals with Medicaid. One participant stated, "Yes, I really liked the acupuncture but the crazy thing; my insurance company would not pay for that. The guidelines recommend that clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if the expected benefits to both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patients, and that if opioids are used, they should be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy.

Furthermore, they recommend that before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function, and only continue opioid therapy if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety. Participants also considered physical therapy and acupuncture as potential treatments for managing pain, but access to these interventions may be limited by lack of coverage by Medicaid. 33 In 4 states, Medicaid covers acupuncture for back pain and migraine, but no state covers this intervention for SCD. 34–37 There are limited data available on the efficacy of acupuncture in the management of pain in SCD. 38.

American Society of Hematology 2020 SCD acute pain — panel considerations for recommendations 2a to 2d emphasize nonopioid options and feasibility: The panel agreed that identifying nonopioid pharmacological treatments that have benefit for the treatment of acute pain in patients with SCD was a priority, and patients and caregivers place a high value on options that may be effective and opioid sparing. The panel discussed lack of perceived efficacy of opioids for acute SCD pain and risks including tolerance, dependence, addiction, and chronic pain. Evidence was largely of low or very low certainty, there were no data on cost effectiveness, and feasibility depends on resource and technical requirements affecting equity and acceptability; for example, some institutions do not allow subanesthetic ketamine infusions on a general medical floor and instead require intensive care unit placement and administration only by pain medicine physicians or anesthesiologists.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) chronic opioid therapy (COT) — evidence limits, individualized approach, and care considerations are emphasized: The panel concluded that the balance of benefits vs harms varies and that these recommendations emphasize the individualized treatment approach (ie, not one size fits all) required for the management of chronic pain. The panel acknowledges that the evidence is insufficient to determine the efficacy and/or effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain in individuals living with SCD, and indirect evidence is also insufficient and supports risk for harms. The decision to initiate, continue, or taper COT should be contingent on regular risk assessment, and shared decision making between the provider and patient with ongoing reassessment of the above issues. The panel concluded that there is an important need to engage patients in a discussion about the use of COT for the treatment of chronic SCD pain before its initiation, including discussion of the risks of COT and of the insufficient evidence that addresses the benefits of COT, and that this should be done proactively with all patients when they are in their baseline state of health. The panel also acknowledges that individuals living with SCD who are receiving COT require frequent monitoring. The panel concluded that patient function should be assessed from the shared patient/clinician perspective, and the use of standardized patient-reported outcome tools that assess patient functioning is encouraged. The panel concluded that engaging patients in a discussion about COT and the complex management approach required to consider COT should be considered, including coprescribing naloxone, prescribing the minimum effective dose of opioids, and avoiding coprescribing benzodiazepines; collaboration with pain specialists and implementation of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary care should also be considered, if available.

Remarks specify that this is "based largely on indirect evidence from adult patients without SCD affected with fibromyalgia," that "Fibromyalgia was selected by panel consensus as the entity most closely aligned with chronic pain in SCD with no identifiable cause," and that "The significant lack of pediatric data for the use of gabapentinoids for pain management could not support a recommendation for this age group."

### How would you treat this patient with acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6473b2a4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease is prevalent in large numbers of patients in the United States and has a significant global impact. Its complications span numerous organs and lead to reduced life expectancy. Acute and chronic sickle cell pain is a common cause of patient suffering. The American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on management of acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease in 2019. Several of the recommendations are conditional and leave specific decisions to the treating physician. These include conditional recommendations about the use of ketamine for acute pain and the initiation and discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Here, 2 hematologists discuss these guidelines and make contrasting recommendations for the management of acute and chronic pain for a patient with sickle cell disease.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease — chronic opioid therapy (COT) management: For adults and children with chronic pain from sickle cell disease (SCD) who are receiving COT, are functioning poorly, or are at high risk for aberrant opioid use or toxicity, the panel suggests against continuation of COT as a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects. Patients on COT should avoid benzodiazepines, sedating medications, and alcohol; require careful monitoring of functional status and risk for aberrant opioid use as a precursor to dose reduction or weaning; assessment of function is encouraged using standardized patient‑reported outcome tools; and weaning or withdrawal should be done carefully because it is potentially higher risk in SCD. Good practice statements add to implement harm reduction strategies for patients on COT (strongly consider coprescribing naloxone, avoid coprescribing opioids and benzodiazepines, and prescribe the lowest effective opioid dose), consider collaboration with pain medicine specialists, consider consulting an addiction medicine physician when there is valid and substantial evidence of aberrant opioid use, provide patient‑centered education regarding COT risks, and routinely screen for depression and anxiety with targeted screening for other psychological comorbidities. Acute pain events may still be treated with opioid analgesia if this serves the overall plan, but this should be done in conjunction with the primary outpatient management team, and nonopioid medications and integrative therapies should also be offered.

Sickle cell disease acute pain — continuous basal opioid infusion in addition to on-demand opioids with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has no direct evidence of benefit or harm in hospitalized individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Therefore, the panel concluded that the benefit of basal opioid infusion in addition to on-demand opioids as a treatment of acute SCD pain is largely unknown, and indirect evidence reviewed above suggests an increased risk of respiratory depression but was derived primarily from postoperative surgical patients who were likely opioid naive, making the data less relevant to SCD. Ultimately, because the risk for harm has not been studied in patients with SCD and no studies have investigated the benefit, a recommendation in either direction could not be made, and the panel has put forth a nonrecommendation for this question. The panel also noted no important uncertainty about patient values, with patients placing significant importance on pain relief and improved functioning with fewer negative adverse effects and risks for harm.

Recommendation 10 — chronic transfusion therapy for recurrent acute pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is supported by very low certainty evidence: the systematic review identified 7 studies; of these, there were 4 RCTs enrolling a total of 439 children and 72 pregnant women and 3 studies comparing rates before and after starting transfusions (31 children and 15 adults). The only studies to include a substantial proportion of people with recurrent acute pain at entry were small (13 to 17 participants), and none reported on HRQOL outcomes. In the transfused arms, the rate of acute pain episodes decreased by 17 to 61 per 100 person-years in children and from 50% to 16% during pregnancy. The panel discussed the fact that monthly blood cell transfusion has a moderate risk of harm and a very high burden, and overall determined that the balance of effects favors the comparison, leading to a conditional recommendation against the intervention.

### Impact of sickle cell disease on patients' daily lives, symptoms reported, and disease management strategies: results from the international sickle cell world assessment survey (SWAY) [^de8500c8]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, 66% of patients scored 5‐7 on the Likert scale (indicating that they agreed or strongly agreed with a given statement) when reporting that their treatment effectively managed their symptoms (n = 1393/2123) and controlled their SCD (n = 1394/2123). However, patients had concerns about the short‐term (n = 1086/2123 [51%]) and long‐term (n = 1283/2123 [60%]) side effects of their treatments. Patientsʼ concerns over specific side effects were not explored in the survey. Of the patients currently taking any pain management medication (n = 1353), 72% would like an alternative medication (Table S7). Most patients (n = 1507/2145 [70%]: HI, n = 853/1204 [71%]; LMI, n = 654/941 [70%]) were confident (score 5‐7) in the assessment/treatment they received from their HCP (Figure S8): the majority were managed by an SCD specialist (n = 1296 [60%]: HI, n = 849/1204 [71%]; LMI, n = 447/941 [48%]) (Table S8).

The most commonly selected treatment goal was to improve QoL (n = 1187/2145, 55%); selected by 55% (n = 668/1204) of patients in HI countries and 55% (n = 519/941) in LMI countries. Other common treatment goals were to prevent worsening of SCD (n = 930 [43%]: HI, n = 577 [48%]; LMI, n = 353 [38%]), reduce the number of severe pain crises (n = 638 [30%]: HI, n = 386 [32%]; LMI, n = 252 [27%]), improve overall symptoms (n = 618 [29%]: HI, n = 339 [28%]; LMI, n = 279 [30%]), and improve long‐term survival (n = 602 [28%]: HI, n = 338 [28%]; LMI, n = 264 [28%]).

Sickle cell disease chronic pain — COT management, withdrawal, and episodic pain considerations: Collaboration with a pain specialist should be strongly considered for additional or alternative pain management strategies. Weaning and/or withdrawal from COT is potentially a higher-risk entity in patients with SCD and should be done carefully. Acute pain events may still be treated with opioid analgesia if this serves the overall pain treatment plan, but this should be done in conjunction with the primary outpatient management team, and nonopioid medications and integrative therapies should also be considered. To reduce unintentional COT, providers should make efforts to reduce or eliminate scheduled opioid doses between acute episodic pain events.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease (SCD) pain guideline — initiation of chronic opioid therapy (COT): It is good practice to deliver patient-centered education regarding the potential to develop chronic pain and the nonopioid pain treatment options that are outlined in recommendations 6, 7, and 8. For adults and children with SCD and emerging and/or recently developed chronic pain, the ASH guideline panel suggests against the initiation of COT unless pain is refractory to multiple other treatment modalities (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks emphasize optimization of SCD management, that in those whose pain has been refractory to multiple other interventions, COT should be considered after risk stratification using a validated tool, documentation of failure criteria and a plan for opioid cessation before initiation, and that the lowest effective opioid dose should be prescribed. Additional safety notes include avoiding benzodiazepines, sedating medications, and alcohol; that patients on doses of > 120 mg of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) are at risk for hormonal alterations; and that doses > 100 mg of MME are associated with an increase in risk of overdose compared with doses < 20 mg of MME in other non-SCD pain populations. Providers should be aware that frequent episodic pain can lead to unintentional COT and should make efforts to reduce or eliminate scheduled opioid doses between acute episodic pain events, with documentation of goals of care in the medical record.

### The pediatric clinician's evidence-based strategies for anticipatory management and treatment of acute pain at home for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease [^32e79c02]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Acute pain episodes are the most common complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) in children and adolescents, mostly occurring at home and requiring prompt and effective management to prevent progression and comorbidities. Optimal management includes avoidance of common triggers and school-based interventions. Evidence-based strategies for managing acute SCD pain at home emphasize the role of pediatric clinicians in early recognition, assessment, and treatment. We provide a stepwise approach with initial nonpharmacologic methods such as massage, heat application, and hydration with or without pain medication. We also provide red flag symptoms necessitating triage from home to medical facility.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^5498934a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy with potential life-threatening complications that affect millions of people worldwide. Severe and disabling acute pain, referred to as a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is a fundamental symptom of the disease and the primary driver for acute care visits and hospitalizations. Despite the publication of guidelines for VOC management over the past decade, management of VOCs remains unsatisfactory for patients and providers.

Recent Findings

Acute SCD pain includes pain secondary to VOCs and other forms of acute pain. Distinguishing VOC from non-VOC pain may be challenging for both patients and clinicians. Further, although opioids have been the gold-standard for VOC pain management for decades, the current highest standard of care for all acute pain is a multimodal approach that is less dependent on opioids, and, instead incorporates analgesics and adjuvants from different mechanistic pathways. In this narrative review, we focus on a multimodal pharmacologic approach for acute SCD pain management and explore the evidence for existing non-opioid pharmacological adjuncts. Moreover, we present an explanatory model of pain, which is not only novel in its application to SCD pain but also captures the multidimensional nature of the SCD pain experience and supports the need for such a multimodal approach. This model also highlights opportunities for new investigative and therapeutic targets – both pharmacological and non-pharmacological.

Summary

Multimodal pain regimens that are less dependent on opioids are urgently needed to improve acute pain outcomes for individuals with SCD. The proposed explanatory model for SCD pain offers novel opportunities to improve acute pain management for SCD patients.

### Ethical issues in the management of sickle cell pain [^0882795e]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Care providers who manage patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often face several questions. Most prominent among these pertain to the importance of pain and its treatment. The duties of the health care providers concerning pain management are often not well defined and vary considerably among providers and institutions. Despite the availability of national guidelines that address the ethical issues of pain management, patients with SCD often receive suboptimal pain control, especially during acute painful episodes. Although there are many reasons for this situation, an important aspect of the problem pertains to the complexity of applying ethical standards to specific patients with sickle cell pain. Decisions are frequently made according to perceptions and circumstances without taking ethical principles into consideration. The purpose of this paper is to present the range of ethical principles pertinent to sickle pain management and discuss specific examples of physician-patient interactions where ethical dilemmas occur.

### Medical management… [^bff9a236]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Acute pain in patients with sickle cell disease is caused by ischemic tissue injury resulting from the occlusion of microvascular beds by sickled erythrocytes during an acute crisis. Chronic pain occurs because of the destruction of bones, joints and visceral organs as a result of recurrent crises. The effect of unpredictable recurrences of acute crises on chronic pain creates a unique pain syndrome. 2, 3 Acute bone pain from microvascular occlusion is a common reason for emergency department visits and hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease. Pain Patterns in the Vaso-occlusive Crisis A vaso-occlusive crisis most commonly involves the back, legs, knees, arms, chest and abdomen. Medical Management Acute sickle cell crises are managed primarily with drug therapy. Psychologic supportive care is also important. The standard treatment approach includes opioid analgesics, adequate hydration, rest, and cognitive and behavioral therapies.

4 Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary team that includes a family physician, a hematologist, nurses, a psychiatrist, a physical therapist, a pain specialist and social workers. These team members work together to provide empathetic, consistent, longitudinal care in a trustworthy environment. SPECIFIC PAIN MANAGEMENT Many drug regimens have been effective in the treatment of acute pain in sickle cell disease. Pain management should follow the three-step "analgesic ladder" recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of cancer-related pain. 18 The choice of analgesic and the dosage used should be based on the severity of pain in the individual patient. MEPERIDINE VS. MORPHINE In the past, moderate to severe pain in sickle cell disease was usually treated with meperidine administered parenterally or, more commonly, intramuscularly.

Compared with morphine, however, meperidine has a number of properties that make it a poor opioid analgesic for repeated use in most patients with sickle cell disease. Patient-controlled analgesia offers several unique advantages in the treatment of severe pain occurring in a vaso-occlusive crisis. 15, 23, 24 One study 24 found that the intermittent fixed schedule and the patient-controlled method were equally efficacious in providing adequate analgesia. Patient-controlled analgesia prevents fluctuation in blood drug levels and may reduce the time between the perception of pain and the administration of the analgesic. This approach reduces overmedication and excessive sedation. It also provides patient autonomy and decreases the nursing time required for analgesic administration.

### Management of vasoocclusive pain events in sickle cell disease [^575f37a7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Vasoocclusive pain events (VOEs) are the primary cause of morbidity and account for most emergency department visits and hospitalizations for patients with SCD in the United States and Europe. The nature of VOE makes its management extremely challenging. There are no large controlled trials of analgesic regimens for VOE, and smaller trials have generally failed to produce an optimal course of therapy. Therefore, treatment recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and anecdotal experience. Although VOEs are not life-threatening, inadequate treatment may result in unnecessary morbidity and life-threatening complications. Health care providers caring for patients with SCD must be well informed about the management of VOE. This continuing medical education article will provide a summary of the management of acute pain events in SCD with particular emphasis on adequate analgesia.

Chronic nonopioid therapy for chronic sickle cell disease (SCD) pain without an identifiable cause — the panel emphasizes individualized decision-making with very low certainty of evidence, noting indirect data and patient value considerations. The panel states that data supporting these recommendations rely heavily on indirect evidence and that there is very low certainty in the evidence about effects for patients with SCD; it concluded that the decision to initiate and continue chronic nonopioid therapy should be individualized and based on a balance of benefits, harms, risk assessment, and shared decision making. The panel concluded these interventions should be considered either as a sole pharmacological agent or in combination with an opioid to reduce the total opioid dose. Benefits data are absent in children and adolescents and harms in these groups are largely unknown; amine reuptake inhibitors, including selected SNRIs and TCAs, have warnings that these drugs may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents. Patients place significant importance on pain relief and improved functioning with the fewest adverse effects, and the panel notes feasibility but potential barriers and inequities in access. The ASH guideline panel suggests considering chronic nonopioid therapy.

### 2019 sickle cell disease guidelines by the American Society of Hematology: methodology, challenges, and innovations [^2cc72fb5]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) convened 5 guideline panels to develop clinical practice recommendations addressing 5 management areas of highest importance to individuals living with sickle cell disease: pain, cerebrovascular complications, pulmonary and kidney complications, transfusion, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Panels were multidisciplinary and consisted of patient representatives, content experts, and methodologists. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted systematic reviews based on a priori selected questions. In this exposition, we describe the process used by ASH, including the GRADE approach (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) for rating certainty of the evidence and the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework. We also describe several unique challenges faced by the guideline panels and the specific innovations and solutions used to address them, including a curriculum to train patients to engage in guideline development, dealing with the opioid crisis, and working with indirect and noncomparative evidence.

### Beyond IV push: alternative methods for management of acute pain in SCD [^6a986090]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) involves multiple, complex downstream effects of vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and inflammation, ultimately resulting in severe and sudden pain. Historically, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the cornerstone of treatment for acute SCD pain. However, given the evolving understanding of the complexity of pain pathways in SCD and the desire to avoid NSAID and opioid-induced side effects, a multimodal approach is needed to effectively treat acute SCD pain. In this article we review recent research supporting the utilization of nonopioid pharmacologic interventions and nonpharmacologic interventions while also describing the research questions that remain surrounding their use and efficacy and effectiveness in the management of acute SCD pain. Furthermore, we review care delivery processes shown to improve acute SCD pain outcomes and highlight areas where more work is needed. Through this comprehensive approach, alternative mechanistic pathways may be addressed, leading to improved SCD pain outcomes.

Remarks specify that NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective COX inhibitors; that patient-specific assessment of harms, including renal, vascular, and gastrointestinal toxicity, anticoagulation requirements, and cardiovascular disease, will help identify patients who are appropriate for NSAID therapy and tailor the selection of the drug/class of NSAID; and that patients specifically at increased risk of renal toxicity need to be identified and, if comorbidities such as peptic ulcer disease, renal dysfunction, or full-dose anticoagulation are significant risk factors, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk.

No recommendation — chronic monthly transfusion therapy for chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD): For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the ASH guideline panel chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option to prevent or reduce recurrent pain episodes. Remarks state that in unique circumstances when all other measures to control recurrent pain episodes have failed (eg, hydroxyurea, other disease-modifying therapies) and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; the decision should be influenced primarily by patient preference where patients appreciate the uncertainty in benefit over the burden and risks of monthly transfusion; integration of education and informed shared decision making around initiation and/or cessation of chronic transfusion therapy are important; access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis are also considerations that could favor monthly transfusions in the exceptional circumstances noted above; and because the cessation of chronic transfusions can be associated with other SCD complications, it is important to ensure evaluation if cessation of chronic transfusion is considered, including initiation of other disease-modifying therapies and increased surveillance.

### Pain syndromes in sickle cell disease: an update [^99c7a61a]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Pain has a critical role in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients may suffer from several pain syndromes, which may be or not may be associated with other clinical complications, such as anemia, organ failures, and infections.

Design

Data for review were identified by using PubMed to search MEDLINE, limiting the search to abstract/articles in English, Italian, French, and Dutch. The key words pain, sickle cell disease, anemia, hemoglobin, hemoglobinopathy, analgesics, opioids, morphine, acetaminophen, paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hematology, and quality of life were variously combined in the title, abstract, and key word search list. The abstract database of most hematological congresses and the bibliographies of most relevant articles were also considered.

Results

There are two major types of SCD pain: acute and chronic. Sometimes, mixed and neuropathic pain can be also observed. Acute pain is mostly related to vaso-occlusion. Chronic pain may be due to some SCD complications, such as leg ulcers and avascular necrosis.

Conclusions

Pain management in the SCD setting needs multidisciplinary approaches, given the several syndromes and the pathogenic mechanisms that are likely involved. Pain management is not standardized and often difficult, so that many patients with SCD are still poorly treated. Further efforts to develop care plans and treatment protocols as well as management guidelines are required.

### Sickle cell disease: a review of nonpharmacological approaches for pain [^82d8db5d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening condition that affects more than seven million people worldwide. The most common complication experienced by persons living with SCD is pain. Evidence supports the use of nonpharmacologic therapies in managing psychological and social complications of pain in persons with SCD, but there is little consensus if these approaches can also be applied for the treatment of pain in SCD.

Objectives

To describe and synthesize the use of nonpharmacological therapies for reducing pain of any type and origin in persons with SCD.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Databases were searched using the following terms: sickle cell, pain, and nonpharmacological therapies. Interventions were graded for methodological quality and categorized as 1) peer-support group therapies, 2) educational/psychological therapies, and 3) skill-based therapies.

Results

Twenty-eight nonpharmacological interventions for persons with SCD were examined. Of these studies, a wide variety of nonpharmacological interventions were tested. Twelve studies yielded significant improvements in pain, three studies reported no positive effect or differences between experimental and control conditions on pain or a pain-related outcome, and one study reported a negative or detrimental intervention effect.

Conclusion

Approximately half of the studies reviewed demonstrated success in alleviating pain, suggesting that patients are able to use nonpharmacological interventions to reduce pain with some degree of success. Questions still remain regarding the efficacy and generalizability of these interventions for persons with SCD.

Recommendation 2b — corticosteroids for acute SCD pain indicates that for adults and children presenting for acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests against corticosteroids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks clarify that steroids should still be used when appropriate for other medical indications such as asthma, and that systemic corticosteroid exposure, particularly cessation of steroids, has been associated with rebound pain and other complications; therefore decisions for other indications should be made in collaboration with experts in SCD.

Basal opioid infusions in addition to on-demand opioid treatment — research needs: Because of the absence of data on efficacy, effectiveness, and harms and the inability of the panel to make a recommendation, the panel discussed research priorities for people with SCD, including study of benefits and harms, comparative-effectiveness research using existing data to determine benefits and/or harms of basal opioid infusions, and safety registries to monitor adverse events in hospitals that administer basal opioid infusions in addition to on-demand opioid PCA strategies.

American Society of Hematology 2020 sickle cell disease — movement-based therapies for chronic pain — no recommendation: No recommendation is made for physical activities, exercise, or combined meditation/movement programs (including aerobic exercise, yoga, and Pilates) for treatment of chronic pain because the systematic review identified no direct studies in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and relied on indirect evidence from chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. Indirect evidence included 1 systematic review on Pilates showing a reduction in pain intensity in chronic low back pain, 6 systematic reviews on physical activity reporting small improvements in pain intensity and disability (2 in fibromyalgia and 4 in chronic low back pain), and 2 reviews on core stability exercise with conflicting results. Therefore, no recommendation could be made for or against these therapies; there was no direct evidence of benefit, with only speculative indirect evidence of improved pain control and functional disability in other chronic pain conditions.

### WHO recommendations on the management of sickle-cell disease during pregnancy, childbirth and the interpregnancy period [^3b30edea]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sickle cell disease, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (pain management), WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to collaborate with pregnant patients with SCD to develop individualized pain-management plans as early in pregnancy as possible, basing the plan on the severity and frequency of pain crises, the patient's views and preferences, and including a multidisciplinary team approach to care.
