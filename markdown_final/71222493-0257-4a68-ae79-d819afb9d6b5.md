## Question

calcium requirement for osteoporosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calcium requirements for osteoporosis, specifically how they differ between primary prevention and treatment, what the evidence says about benefits and harms, and how to translate this information into practical dosing advice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the distinction between primary prevention and treatment of established osteoporosis. Then, I should verify the recommended total calcium intake targets by age and sex. Next, I will review the evidence for benefits and harms of calcium supplementation, including fracture outcomes and adverse effects. After that, I need to check how vitamin D status modifies calcium recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered guidance on diet-first strategies, supplement dosing, monitoring, and special populations, and I will double-check for any internal inconsistencies that need correction.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope, because I need to ensure I am not conflating primary prevention with treatment of established osteoporosis. Primary prevention applies to community-dwelling adults without osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency, whereas treatment applies to patients with confirmed osteoporosis or those receiving pharmacologic therapy, and the evidence base and recommendations differ meaningfully between these groups, so I should keep them separate in my reasoning [^114s4MHD] [^113d5URw].

> I should confirm the recommended total calcium intake targets by age and sex, and I need to verify that these refer to total intake from diet plus supplements. For adults 19–50 years, 1,000 mg/day is appropriate; for women ≥ 51 years and for all adults ≥ 71 years, 1,200 mg/day is recommended; for men 51–70 years, 1,000 mg/day is advised, rising to 1,200 mg/day after age 70, which aligns with IOM/NAM and endocrine society guidance and is echoed by AACE/ACE and NAMS [^114UNZto] [^111V79yZ] [^1125ECco].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence for benefit in primary prevention, because I should not overstate it. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to support routine calcium supplementation for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults, and specifically recommends against low-dose combinations such as ≤ 400 IU vitamin D with ≤ 1,000 mg calcium for postmenopausal women given no benefit and increased kidney stone risk, so routine calcium pills are not advised for primary prevention in this population [^112noAMp] [^111RTyG4] [^116gvxq5]. Hold on, I should also review meta-analytic data; a large meta-analysis found no fracture reduction with vitamin D alone, whereas combined calcium and vitamin D reduced hip fracture risk by about 16%, but this signal is inconsistent across trials and not sufficient to overturn the USPSTF's primary prevention stance in community-dwelling adults [^117UkEoz] [^114KPAtG].

> Next, I should review the evidence for established osteoporosis and treatment settings, because that is where calcium is more clearly indicated. Guidelines consistently recommend ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D as adjuncts to pharmacologic osteoporosis therapy, largely to prevent treatment-related hypocalcemia and to support skeletal mineralization, even though calcium alone does not reliably reduce fractures and the magnitude of BMD gains from calcium is small and nonprogressive beyond one year [^113d5URw] [^113a1955] [^114VpDcu] [^1137xVeb]. Let me reconsider the magnitude of benefit; meta-analyses show small BMD increases of about 1–2% and modest, inconsistent fracture reductions with supplements, reinforcing that calcium is supportive rather than a stand-alone anti-fracture therapy [^1137xVeb] [^114KPAtG].

> I need to check the safety profile carefully, because harms can offset small benefits. Calcium supplements are associated with increased kidney stone risk, with the WHI showing a 17% increase when total calcium approached 2,100 mg/day, and some meta-analyses have signaled a small increase in cardiovascular events with calcium supplements, although this remains controversial and not uniformly observed; gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation are common, and very high total calcium intake may be associated with increased mortality in observational cohorts, so I should counsel caution with excess supplementation [^1117yH8D] [^1163j6Mp] [^113nCf3X] [^1163xWiY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; given these risks, a diet-first approach with judicious, low-dose supplementation only when needed is prudent [^1163j6Mp].

> I should confirm how vitamin D status modifies calcium advice, because absorption and skeletal response are vitamin D dependent. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older adults and impairs intestinal calcium absorption; ensuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of at least 20 ng/mL, and in many guidelines 30 ng/mL, improves calcium utilization, and pooled analyses suggest fracture benefits from vitamin D emerge at intakes around 800 IU/day or higher in older adults, particularly when combined with calcium, although vitamin D alone has not consistently reduced fractures in community settings [^112pqMmK] [^111V79yZ] [^111Wwyny] [^117UkEoz] [^1115esJi]. But wait, what if vitamin D is already sufficient; even then, calcium without vitamin D has weaker evidence for fracture reduction, reinforcing the need to address both nutrients together when supplementation is used in high-risk groups [^1115esJi].

> Now, I will translate this into practical, diet-first counseling, and I should double-check typical dietary shortfalls. Most older adults consume roughly 600–900 mg/day of calcium, so aiming for 1,000–1,200 mg/day typically requires about 1–2 additional servings of dairy or high-calcium nondairy foods daily; supplements should be reserved to bridge the gap, and many patients need no more than 500–600 mg/day of supplemental calcium to reach targets, which helps avoid excess intake and related harms [^111bdQyg] [^111Rh7Pe] [^1125ECco]. Let me verify absorption guidance; calcium carbonate is best taken with meals and in divided doses of ≤ 500–600 mg per dose, while calcium citrate is less dependent on gastric acid and may be preferred in patients on acid suppression or with GI intolerance, and these formulation nuances matter for safety and efficacy [^115wa3RN].

> I should confirm the supplementation strategy for established osteoporosis and during pharmacotherapy, because this is where calcium is most clearly warranted. In patients with osteoporosis or those on antiresorptives or anabolics, guidelines recommend ensuring a total calcium intake of 1,000–1,200 mg/day and vitamin D sufficiency to mitigate hypocalcemia risk and support treatment response; in men, the same 1,000–1,200 mg/day total target applies, ideally from diet with supplements added only as needed [^113d5URw] [^113a1955] [^111V79yZ]. Hold on, I should verify whether higher calcium doses improve outcomes; evidence does not show added benefit beyond 1,200–1,500 mg/day and suggests potential harm above this range, so I should cap total intake accordingly in routine care [^1163j6Mp] [^111Rh7Pe].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts where recommendations may differ, and I need to ensure I am precise. For glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, rheumatology guidelines advise age-appropriate calcium targets consistent with RDAs and emphasize optimizing calcium and vitamin D status given the catabolic bone effects of steroids, which supports the same 1,000–1,200 mg/day framework with attention to deficiency correction [^114pu5A6]. For frail, institutionalized elderly with low dietary calcium and vitamin D, combined calcium and vitamin D has shown the clearest fracture benefit signals, aligning with the observation that benefits are more pronounced when baseline insufficiencies are corrected and adherence is high [^112jxWt4] [^111Wwyny].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance, and I should double-check that I am not overstating benefits. For primary prevention in community-dwelling adults, the balance favors diet-only strategies and does not support routine calcium supplementation given insufficient fracture benefit and increased kidney stone risk; for established osteoporosis or during pharmacotherapy, ensuring total calcium intake of 1,000–1,200 mg/day with vitamin D sufficiency is recommended as adjunctive care to prevent hypocalcemia and support skeletal mineralization, acknowledging that calcium's direct anti-fracture effect is modest and inconsistent [^112noAMp] [^111RTyG4] [^113d5URw] [^114KPAtG]. I should confirm the practical guardrails: avoid exceeding 1,200–1,500 mg/day total calcium, prefer dietary sources, and use the lowest effective supplement dose in divided servings to minimize GI and renal risks [^1163j6Mp] [^115wa3RN].

> But wait, I initially thought some authorities advise 1,300 mg/day for all women over 50; hold on, I should verify and correct that. The IOM sets 1,200 mg/day for women ≥ 51 and for all adults ≥ 71, and although some summaries cite 1,300 mg/day for older women, this appears to conflate Australian/New Zealand guidance with U.S. recommendations; the U.S. consensus is 1,200 mg/day for women ≥ 51 and men ≥ 71, so I should align with 1,200 mg/day rather than 1,300 mg/day in U.S. practice [^114UNZto] [^116ZqV7U] [^112JMrwP].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are clear and actionable. Total calcium intake of 1,000–1,200 mg/day is appropriate for most older adults, with 1,200 mg/day for women ≥ 51 and adults ≥ 71. Prioritize diet first and add supplements only to bridge deficits, generally not exceeding 500–600 mg/day of supplemental calcium, divide doses to ≤ 500–600 mg, pair with adequate vitamin D, monitor for GI side effects and kidney stones, and reassess periodically as diet and medications change [^112JMrwP] [^111Rh7Pe] [^115wa3RN]. For patients with osteoporosis or on osteoporosis drugs, confirm calcium and vitamin D adequacy at baseline and during therapy to prevent hypocalcemia and support treatment efficacy, recognizing calcium's supportive rather than standalone anti-fracture role [^113d5URw] [^113a1955].

---

Calcium intake of **1,000–1,200 mg/day** (total from diet plus supplements) is recommended for adults with osteoporosis [^114UNZto], with **800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D** to ensure absorption and safety [^112JMrwP] [^112pqMmK]. Supplements are used to meet the target only when dietary intake is insufficient [^1125ECco], and total calcium intake should not exceed 2,000–2,500 mg/day to avoid adverse effects [^111Rh7Pe] [^112UNaKz]. Combined calcium and vitamin D reduces fracture risk in older adults [^117UkEoz], but high-dose calcium supplements alone may increase cardiovascular and renal risks, so **diet-first strategies are preferred** [^113nCf3X] [^117TVijA].

---

## Recommended calcium intake for osteoporosis

Recommended calcium intake for osteoporosis is **1,000–1,200 mg/day** for adults ≥ 50 years, including postmenopausal women and older men [^114UNZto] [^113DUpmT]. For adults < 50 years, intake is **1,000 mg/day** for optimal bone health and osteoporosis prevention [^114UNZto].

---

## Evidence supporting calcium intake recommendations

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Higher calcium intake is associated with modest increases in BMD, which may reduce fracture risk [^115QpSGV] [^1137xVeb].

- **Fracture risk reduction**: Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduces fracture risk, particularly in older adults [^112jxWt4] [^117UkEoz].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Calcium and vitamin D are recommended as adjuncts to osteoporosis pharmacotherapy to prevent hypocalcemia and enhance treatment efficacy [^113a1955] [^111Wwyny].

---

## Sources of calcium

Calcium can be obtained from **dietary sources** — dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), leafy greens (kale, broccoli), fortified foods (orange juice, cereals), and nuts/seeds — and from **calcium supplements** (calcium carbonate or citrate) when dietary intake is insufficient [^1125ECco] [^115wa3RN].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of calcium supplementation

- **Kidney stones**: High-dose calcium supplements (> 1,000 mg/day) increase kidney stone risk [^1163j6Mp] [^111Rh7Pe].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular risk with high-dose calcium supplements, though evidence is mixed [^113nCf3X] [^1163j6Mp].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Constipation, bloating, and nausea may occur with supplements [^113nCf3X] [^111Rh7Pe].

---

## Upper intake limits and safety considerations

The **tolerable upper intake level (UL)** is 2,000–2,500 mg/day for adults; intakes above this increase adverse-effect risk [^111Rh7Pe] [^112UNaKz]. Individualization is important — tailor calcium intake to dietary intake, age, sex, and comorbidities to minimize risks [^112JMrwP] [^111Rh7Pe].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Dietary assessment**: Evaluate dietary calcium intake before prescribing supplements [^112JMrwP].

- **Supplementation**: Use supplements to meet the 1,000–1,200 mg/day target only when dietary intake is insufficient [^116thToY] [^1125ECco].

- **Vitamin D**: Ensure adequate vitamin D intake (800–1,000 IU/day) to facilitate calcium absorption and reduce fracture risk [^113VgCL7] [^112pqMmK].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for adverse effects, especially kidney stones and gastrointestinal symptoms [^1163j6Mp] [^111Rh7Pe].

---

Calcium intake of **1,000–1,200 mg/day** is recommended for osteoporosis, with vitamin D to ensure absorption; use supplements only when diet is insufficient, avoid exceeding the UL, and monitor for adverse effects.

Introduction

Osteoporotic fractures are frequent in elderly populations, especially in women, and are associated with high healthcare costs and individual suffering. With ageing populations, the burden of osteoporotic fractures on society will increase in the coming yearsand the prevention of osteoporotic fractures is therefore a major public health issue. The importance and optimal level of calcium intake to compensate for skeletal calcium lossesand for the prevention of osteoporosis and fractures have been much debated and remain unclear. This is reflected by the wide range of daily calcium recommendations for individuals older than 50 years: at present 700 mg in the UK,800 mg in Scandinavia,1200 mg in the United States, and 1300 mg in Australia and New Zealand.

It is problematic to make recommendations regarding calcium intake based on the results from clinical trials and previous cohort studies. Meta-analyses of randomised trials found that supplemental calcium gave modestor no reductionin risk of fracture. Both the habitual dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D status may affect the outcome and are rarely accounted for in the design of calcium supplementation trials. Nor do observational data provide clear evidence, as emphasised by meta-analyses with differing results, on the association between calcium intake and fracture risk. To improve precision, prospective studies with repeated dietary surveys and large numbers of participants are needed.

Against this background, we aimed to investigate associations between long term dietary intake of calcium with risk of fracture of any type, with hip fractures, and with osteoporosis, in a large, population based prospective study of Swedish women.

Osteoporosis affects approximately 8 million women and 2 million men in the United States. The associated fractures are a common and preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in up to 50 percent of older women. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older and women 60 to 64 years of age who have increased fracture risk. Some organizations recommend considering screening in all men 70 years and older. For persons with osteoporosis diagnosed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry or previous fragility fracture, effective first-line treatment consists of fall prevention, adequate intake of calcium (at least 1,200 mg per day) and vitamin D (at least 700 to 800 IU per day), and treatment with a bisphosphonate. Raloxifene, calcitonin, teriparatide, or hormone therapy maybe considered for certain subsets of patients.

Vitamin D and calcium supplementation for fracture prevention — trial evidence and conclusions: The large Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial (n = 36 282), which studied daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and 1000 mg of calcium, reported no significant reduction in any fracture outcome; thus, the USPSTF concluded that supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium does not prevent fractures. Studies of supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium (alone or combined) showed inconsistent results and were frequently underpowered to detect differences; thus, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium to prevent fractures is inadequate.

Given recent concerns that calcium supplements may raise risk for cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, women should aim to meet this recommendation primarily by eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calcium supplements only if needed to reach the RDA goal (often only approximately 500 mg per day in supplements is required).

Calcium intake targets and fracture-risk evidence — For adults aged 50 years and older, the recommended calcium intake is 1,200 mg/day, and AACE, NOF, the IOM (now NAM), and the Endocrine Society recommend that women aged 51 years or older consume 1,200 mg per day of calcium from all sources. A recent meta-analysis from the NOF showed a 15% reduced risk of total fractures (SRRE, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98) and a 30% reduced risk of hip fractures (SRRE, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.87). The average daily calcium intake among American adults is about half of what is recommended, with a median of approximately 600 mg/day, and a dietary history to assess calcium intake prior to recommending calcium supplements is important.

---

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^117TVijA]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

On the basis of the trial data summarised here, we do not think further randomised controlled trials of calcium supplements with or without vitamin D with fracture as the endpoint in the general population are needed. In the population of frail elderly women with low dietary calcium intake and low vitamin D concentrations studied by Chapuy and colleagues, co-administered CaD was clearly beneficial. Important adverse events such as cardiovascular events, however, were not reported, and it remains uncertain whether the benefit was due to vitamin D or calcium or both. Trials to compare the effects of CaD with vitamin D monotherapy in this population group and also to assess whether reduction in fracture risk with anti-resorptive agents requires co-administration of either vitamin D or CaD would be valuable. Surrogate endpoints, such as bone mineral density, allow biological effects of agents to be assessed in much smaller randomised controlled trials. The effects of increasing dietary calcium intake on bone mineral density in the general population and in specific subgroups considered most likely to benefit from this intervention should be examined before large trials with fracture as an endpoint are considered, though it should not be assumed that short term changes in bone density will be sustained or translate into fracture prevention.

Conclusions

In summary, our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents fractures. Calcium supplements have small inconsistent benefits on fracture reduction but probably have an unfavourable risk:benefit profile. There was no risk reduction in fracture at any site in pooled analyses of the randomised controlled trials of calcium supplements at lowest risk of bias, and there was evidence of publication bias in small-moderate sized trials. Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with calcium supplements or through dietary sources.

### WITHDRAWN: calcium supplementation on bone loss in postmenopausal women [^115QJe7L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although calcium is one the simplest and least expensive strategies for preventing osteoporotic fractures calcium supplementation is nevertheless not without controversy (Kanis 1989; Nordin 1990). The Food and Drug Administration in the US has permitted a bone health claim for calcium-rich foods, and the NIH in its Consensus Development Process approved a statement that high calcium intake reduces the risk of osteoporosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of calcium on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Controlled Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 2001, and examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

Selection Criteria

Trials that randomized postmenopausal women to calcium supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet and reported bone mineral density of the total body, vertebral spine, hip, or forearm or recorded the number of fractures, and followed patients for at least one year were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality and extracted data for each trial. For each bone density site (lumbar spine, total body, combined hip and combined forearm), we calculated the weighted mean difference in bone density between treatment and control groups using the percentage change from baseline. We constructed regression models in which the independent variables were year and dose, and the dependent variable was the effect size. This regression was used to determine the years across which pooling was appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed. For each fracture analysis we calculated a risk ratio.

Main Results

Fifteen trials, representing 1806 participants, were included. Calcium was more effective than placebo in reducing rates of bone loss after two or more years of treatment. The pooled difference in percentage change from baseline was 2.05% (95% CI 0.24 to 3.86) for total body bone density, 1.66% (95% CI 0.92 to 2.39) for the lumbar spine at 2 years, 1.60% (95% CI 0.78 to 2.41) for the hip, and 1.91% (95% CI 0.33 to 3.50) for the distal radius. The relative risk of fractures of the vertebrae was 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.09); the relative risk for non-vertebral fractures was 0.86 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.72).

Authors' Conclusions

Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density. The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures, but it is unclear if calcium reduces the incidence of non vertebral fractures.

### Osteoporosis diagnosis and medical treatment [^116PhuKy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, the presence of either low bone mineral density or a history of a fragility fracture, is known to be associated with an increased risk of future fracture. Fracture prevention is possible through use of both nonpharmacologic and prescription treatments. Despite recent controversy regarding the safety of calcium supplementation and the appropriate dosing of calcium and vitamin D, calcium and vitamin D remain an important part of bone health. However, prescription osteoporosis treatments should be considered for those at higher risk for fracture, and there are currently several treatment options available.

### Reducing fracture risk with calcium and vitamin D [^113BDzPM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50–75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden and risk factors: Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living and 20% to 30% of patients will die. Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assistance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living. Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures; Seventeen to 19% of falls result in fractures, and nearly all hip fractures are related to a fall. Most fractures (71%) occur among women, and an estimated 74% of all fractures that occur in women are among those 65 years or older.

### Calcium and vitamin D in osteoporosis [^113j9Tqk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are useful adjunctive therapies in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Peak BMD is optimally achieved with sustained optimal calcium and vitamin D intakes. Calcium and vitamin D intakes continue to be important after the third decade and into senescence. Although calcium and vitamin D are not therapies to be used alone to prevent early postmenopausal bone loss, they assume more prominent roles in late menopause and in the elderly to preserve bone health with advancing age. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an important adjunctive therapy to use together with antiresorptive therapies.

### A pooled analysis of vitamin D dose requirements for fracture prevention [^112pqMmK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

The results of meta-analyses examining the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and fracture reduction have been inconsistent.

Methods

We pooled participant-level data from 11 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of oral vitamin D supplementation (daily, weekly, or every 4 months), with or without calcium, as compared with placebo or calcium alone in persons 65 years of age or older. Primary end points were the incidence of hip and any nonvertebral fractures according to Cox regression analyses, with adjustment for age group, sex, type of dwelling, and study. Our primary aim was to compare data from quartiles of actual intake of vitamin D (including each individual participant's adherence to the treatment and supplement use outside the study protocol) in the treatment groups of all trials with data from the control groups.

Results

We included 31,022 persons (mean age, 76 years; 91% women) with 1111 incident hip fractures and 3770 nonvertebral fractures. Participants who were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D, as compared with those assigned to control groups, had a nonsignificant 10% reduction in the risk of hip fracture (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80 to 1.01) and a 7% reduction in the risk of nonvertebral fracture (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.99). By quartiles of actual intake, reduction in the risk of fracture was shown only at the highest intake level (median, 800 IU daily; range, 792 to 2000), with a 30% reduction in the risk of hip fracture (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86) and a 14% reduction in the risk of any nonvertebral fracture (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96). Benefits at the highest level of vitamin D intake were fairly consistent across subgroups defined by age group, type of dwelling, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and additional calcium intake.

Conclusions

High-dose vitamin D supplementation (≥ 800 IU daily) was somewhat favorable in the prevention of hip fracture and any nonvertebral fracture in persons 65 years of age or older. (Funded by the Swiss National Foundations and others.).

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115SXLZA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

New U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned 2 systematic evidence reviews and a meta-analysis on vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium to assess the effects of supplementation on bone health outcomes in community-dwelling adults, the association of vitamin D and calcium levels with bone health outcomes, and the adverse effects of supplementation.

Population

These recommendations apply to noninstitutionalized or community-dwelling asymptomatic adults without a history of fractures. This recommendation does not apply to the treatment of persons with osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in premenopausal women or in men. (I statement)The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with greater than 400 IU of vitamin D3 and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women. (I statement)The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women.

Uncertainties and Future Research Needs

The Committee identified a large number of uncertainties surrounding the DRI values, as well as extensive research needs. A particular priority is rigorous, large-scale, randomized clinical trials to test the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal outcomes, as well as to identify threshold effects and possible adverse effects where present. Elucidating the biology of the diverse effects of vitamin D, as well as effects of sun exposure, adiposity, body composition, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors on these associations, is also of great importance.

Calcium supplementation and bone health

A recent large meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled trials reported that calcium supplements lowered the risk of any fracture by a modest but statistically significant 11% (n = 58 573; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Even so, the authors concluded that the evidence for calcium supplements on bone health was weak and inconsistent.

Other large meta-analyses found that calcium supplementation was most effective for preventing hip fractures when it was combined with Vit D. Indeed Vit D plays a major role in intestinal calcium absorption and bone health (figure 2). Additionally, calcium absorption is, in part, dependent on adequate stomach acid, and both these parameters tend to decrease with age. Drugs that markedly reduce stomach acid, such as proton pump inhibitors, have been shown to reduce calcium absorption and increase risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

Figure 2
Total hipbone mineral density by quartiles of calcium intake, stratified by 25(OH) vitamin D. Vitamin D status strongly modifies the bone building effects of oral calcium intake.

A large meta-analysis focusing on calcium intake and fracture risk found that in women (seven prospective cohort studies = 170 991 women, 2954 hip fractures), there was no association between total calcium intake and hip fracture risk (pooled RR per 300 mg total = 1.01; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05). In men (five prospective cohort studies = 68 606 men, 214 hip fractures), the pooled RR per 300 mg of calcium daily was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.03).

Monosupplementation with calcium, especially using the most commonly prescribed formulations (calcium carbonate and calcium citrate) might drive down the absorption of phosphate, thereby contributing to bone demineralisation secondary to abnormal calcium to phosphate ratios. The recently updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has stated that there is insufficient evidence that calcium and Vit D prevent fractures in premenopausal women or in men who have not experienced a prior fracture. Indeed, the USPSTF now recommends against daily calcium supplementation for primary prevention of fragility fractures; stating, 'the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined'.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XLCAb]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The large number of randomised controlled trials that studied increased calcium intake and BMD and the consistency of the results across different populations in studies using higher or lower doses of calcium and in studies of dietary calcium sources or calcium supplements does not reveal any obvious gaps in the evidence. Any future trials conducted should have a strong rationale as to why the results are likely to differ from the large body of existing trial evidence. It is usually recommended that anti-resorptive agents are co-prescribed with calcium and vitamin D, although randomised controlled trials of such agents have shown reductions in risk of fractureand the expected increases in BMDwithout the co-administration of calcium and vitamin D. Randomised controlled trials clarifying the role of calcium and vitamin D in individuals using anti-resorptive agents might be valuable. In subgroup analyses, we stratified trials by thresholds of baseline dietary calcium intake (800 mg/day) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (50 nmol/L). The clinical consequences of low calcium intake or vitamin D status such as osteomalacia, however, probably occur only at much lower thresholds, and there might also be interactions between calcium intake and vitamin D status. Analyses of individual patient data would be valuable in exploring these issues further.

Conclusions

In summary, increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increases BMD by a similar amount to increases in BMD from calcium supplements. In each case, the increases are small (1–2%) and non-progressive, with little further effect on BMD after a year. Subgroup analyses do not suggest greater benefits of increasing calcium intake on BMD in any subpopulation based on clinically relevant baseline characteristics. The small effects on BMD are unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in fractures. Therefore, for most individuals concerned about their bone density, increasing calcium intake is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Osteoporosis: the role of micronutrients [^116b7jSy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be a major public health threat. Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although the results are not always consistent. Higher doses than the current US recommendation (600 IU) of vitamin D in the elderly (age ≥ 65 y) may actually be required for optimal bone health (800–1000 IU/d). The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes; however, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is just being investigated. Vitamin D has been related to falls, with supplementation reducing the number of falls. There are clear fracture benefits demonstrated in randomized clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be easily met by a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate intakes for magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially important nutrients. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes (easily monitored by serum 25(OH)D) for optimal bone health, as well as the prevention of falls and fractures. In addition, a healthy diet that includes 5 servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111edT18]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether increasing calcium intake from dietary sources affects bone mineral density (BMD) and, if so, whether the effects are similar to those of calcium supplements.

Design

Random effects meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, Pubmed, and references from relevant systematic reviews. Initial searches were undertaken in July 2013 and updated in September 2014.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements (with or without vitamin D) in participants aged over 50 with BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, total body, or forearm as an outcome.

Results

We identified 59 eligible randomised controlled trials: 15 studied dietary sources of calcium (n = 1533) and 51 studied calcium supplements (n = 12,257). Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increased BMD by 0.6–1.0% at the total hip and total body at one year and by 0.7–1.8% at these sites and the lumbar spine and femoral neck at two years. There was no effect on BMD in the forearm. Calcium supplements increased BMD by 0.7–1.8% at all five skeletal sites at one, two, and over two and a half years, but the size of the increase in BMD at later time points was similar to the increase at one year. Increases in BMD were similar in trials of dietary sources of calcium and calcium supplements (except at the forearm), in trials of calcium monotherapy versus co-administered calcium and vitamin D, in trials with calcium doses of ≥ 1000 versus < 1000 mg/day and ≤ 500 versus > 500 mg/day, and in trials where the baseline dietary calcium intake was < 800 versus ≥ 800 mg/day.

Conclusions

Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources or by taking calcium supplements produces small non-progressive increases in BMD, which are unlikely to lead to a clinically significant reduction in risk of fracture.

### Dietary calcium intake and bone loss over 6 years in osteopenic postmenopausal women [^111QCypK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Calcium intakes are commonly lower than the recommended levels, and increasing calcium intake is often recommended for bone health.

Objective

To determine the relationship between dietary calcium intake and rate of bone loss in older postmenopausal women.

Participants

Analysis of observational data collected from a randomized controlled trial. Participants were osteopenic (hip T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5) women, aged > 65 years, not receiving therapy for osteoporosis nor taking calcium supplements. Women from the total cohort (n = 1994) contributed data to the analysis of calcium intake and bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline, and women from the placebo group (n = 698) contributed data to the analysis of calcium intake and change in BMD. BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) of the spine, total hip, femoral neck, and total body were measured three times over 6 years.

Results

Mean calcium intake was 886 mg/day. Baseline BMDs were not related to quintile of calcium intake at any site, before or after adjustment for baseline age, height, weight, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking status, and past hormone replacement use. There was no relationship between bone loss and quintile of calcium intake at any site, with or without adjustment for covariables. Total body bone balance (i.e., change in BMC) was unrelated to an individuals' calcium intake (P = 0.99).

Conclusions

Postmenopausal bone loss is unrelated to dietary calcium intake. This suggests that strategies to increase calcium intake are unlikely to impact the prevalence of and morbidity from postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women [^117H7nUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non-vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) -0.04 g/cm 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.03; I² = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm 2, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; I² = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low-certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (-0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0; moderate-certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral). The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.

Discussion

There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of increasing calcium intake in the diet from randomised controlled trials as only two small trials of dietary sources of calcium have reported fracture outcomes. Some 42 cohort studies, however, have assessed relation between dietary calcium intake, milk or dairy intake and fracture. Most analyses (≥ 75%) found no associations, and where there were relations reported, most relative risks were between 0.5 and 2.0, which are considered weak associations in observational studies. The recommended dietary calcium intake for older adults is 1200 mg/day. Most studies, however, did not report reduced risk of fracture in individuals with this level of calcium intake compared with lower intakes. Thus, observational research does not support a hypothesis of dietary "calcium deficiency" in which there are reductions in fracture risk from increasing dietary calcium intake across the range of intakes (< 300- > 1200 mg/day) in studies in this review.

In 26 randomised controlled trials, calcium supplements reduced the risk of total fracture by 11% and vertebral fracture by 14% but had no effect on forearm or hip fracture. The results, however, were not consistent. There was no effect of calcium supplements on any fracture outcome in the largest trials at lowest risk of bias. Only one trial in frail elderly women in residential care with low dietary calcium intake and vitamin D concentrations showed significant reductions in fracture risk. Funnel plots were also asymmetric with more small-moderate sized studies than expected reporting risk reductions in total, vertebral, and forearm fracture with calcium supplements, raising the possibility of publication bias. Results from randomised controlled trials of calcium monotherapy were similar to those with CaD, with no evidence of additional benefit of vitamin D on risk. These results suggest that widespread untargeted use of calcium supplements in older individuals is unlikely to result in meaningful reductions in incidence of fracture.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scope and evidence update — vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults states that persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review and recommendation statement, explains that the recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that low-dose supplementation provides no benefit, and adds that evidence for fracture prevention with vitamin D doses greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate. The USPSTF also notes that evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone and that newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation while also suggesting no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.

3 Management of Osteoporosis

3.1 Lifestyle Factors

Achieving optimal PBM is important to protect against future osteoporosis — PBM is usually achieved by age 40 in women. To reduce the future risk of developing osteoporosis and for optimal bone maintenance, addressing lifestyle factors that may impact BMD is important.

3.1.1 Dietary Calcium Intake

The RDI of calcium for women under 50 years is 1000 mg/day and 1300 mg/day in > 50 years, equivalent to 3–4 servings of dairy. However, only 19% of older adults meet this recommendation. Patient education is vital to achieve calcium RDI, and calcium supplements advised for those unable to reach targets.

3.1.2 Vitamin D

Vitamin D is important for gastrointestinal calcium absorption and bone mineralisation. The major source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure, however balancing detrimental solar UV effects with vitamin D absorption can be difficult. Maintaining vitamin D status > 50 nmol/L is recommended for bone health at all ages, with appropriate sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation ‐ if required, 800–1000 international units per day is usually sufficient.

3.1.3 Protein

Adequate intake of dietary protein is important for acquisition and maintenance of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, to prevent bone loss and sarcopenia. The RDI of protein for adults is 0.8 g/kg/day data, however protein needs are increased in older adults and in pregnant and breastfeeding women. In pregnancy, RDI increases to 1.1 g/kg/day and 1.3 g/kg/day for breastfeeding women. In older adults, intake of 1–1.2 g/kg/day is recommended for bone health and to prevent sarcopenia.

3.1.4 Weight‐Bearing Exercise

Progressive resistance training and weight‐bearing impact exercises have beneficial effects to increase and maintain bone density, structure and strength in all age‐groups. Muscle resistance (strength) training should be regular (minimum twice per week), moderate to vigorous intensity and progressively increase in resistance load. Weight‐bearing impact exercises (e.g. jumping) should be performed most days and include moderate‐to‐high loads in a variety of movements. Balance training in isolation does not improve BMD but may aid in falls prevention. In frail patients, supervision is recommended for exercise programs to reduce falls risk. Walking, cycling and swimming are insufficient to impact and improve BMD, though they have other cardiovascular benefits.

### Calcium supplementation and osteoporosis prevention… [^112CJi2Q]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Background: An estimated 10 million Americans have osteoporosis. Annual health care expenditures on osteoporotic fractures exceed those of breast cancer. One inexpensive preventive measure for osteoporosis is calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation. Although earlier clinical trials have shown effectiveness of calcium in reducing fracture rates, this has not been confirmed in subsequent large trials. Tang and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of calcium therapy, with or without vitamin D supplementation, to prevent osteoporotic bone loss and fracture. This Study: The authors searched multiple electronic databases to identify relevant studies. The reference lists of these studies, plus review articles and abstracts, were also examined.

Studies were excluded if they had no control or placebo group, used diet or complex nutritional supplements as the calcium source, combined calcium with other anti-osteoporotic therapy, or enrolled patients with secondary osteoporosis. Data were abstracted from the eligible studies by two independent reviewers, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results: Of the more than 7, 800 references identified, 29 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was a total of 63, 897 study participants; 92 percent were women with a mean age of 67. 8 years. Calcium was used alone in 16 trials. Vitamin D was combined with calcium in the remaining 13 trials.

Overall, the 17 trials using fracture as an outcome reported a consistent and highly significant 12 percent risk reduction in patients treated with calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation, and the 24 trials studying bone mineral density reported highly significant reductions in bone loss at the hip and spine. Treatment effect did not vary by sex, site of fracture, or history of fracture, but effects were higher in studies with better adherence. Risk reductions were significantly greater for patients older than 70 years compared with younger participants, and institutionalized patients benefited significantly more than those living in the community. Daily calcium doses of 1, 200 mg or more and vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more were associated with significantly better results than lower doses; the addition of vitamin D did not significantly improve the treatment effect.

Treatment effects were higher in patients who had low vitamin D levels and/or calcium intake before the study. Conclusion: The authors conclude that calcium, with or without the addition of vitamin D, shows significant evidence of benefit in the prevention of osteoporotic bone loss and fracture in older patients.

### Calcium and vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis-a clinical update [^1123vJ4h]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an essential component of the management of osteoporosis, supported by a strong scientific rationale. The types of individuals who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplements are those: (i) patients with documented osteoporosis receiving antiresorptive or anabolic treatment; (ii) patients receiving glucocorticoids; and (iii) individuals with or at high risk of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiencies, in particular older women and men. This article describes the evidence base that supports targeting these groups. Benefits are most apparent when 800 IU day(-1) vitamin D is complemented with a dose of 1000–1200 mg day(-1) elemental calcium. Compliance is also key to optimizing clinical efficacy.

### Calcium and vitamin D [^113iovz5]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone maintenance and for treatment-induced bone augmentation. Deficiencies of both nutrients are very common in the age group most afflicted by osteoporosis. Calcium enhancement of estrogen's effects now have been clearly demonstrated. Additionally, all currently approved bone active agents have been tested only in the presence of extra calcium, and newer anabolic agents create a skeletal need for mineral that will require even higher levels of calcium repletion. Prudent nutritional support for osteoporosis prevention and treatment consists of 30 to 40 mmol Ca/d together with sufficient vitamin D to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 80 nmol/L (i.e., approximately 25 microg vitamin D/d).

Recommendations

Promoting early education and a bone healthy lifestyle

Clinical care for osteoporosis typically occurs late in adult life, as bone mineral density (BMD) naturally decreases and risk for fracture increases substantially with age. However, there is value in starting conversations and encouraging individuals to adopt proactive measures to build bone and reduce risk for fracture much earlier in life, especially while bones are still developing.

Adolescence is a critical period for bone mineral accrual, as 40%–60% of adult PBM is accrued during the adolescent years. It is estimated that a 10% increase in the PBM of children and adolescents can reduce the risk of an osteoporotic fracture during adulthood by 50%. In women, the rate of bone accrual peaks in early adolescence (11–14 years old), though bones slowly continue to build in the years immediately following, until PBM is achieved in young adulthood (25–35 years old). Preventive measures initiated during childhood and adolescence when bone mass is still being accrued can have lifelong benefits.

Diet and exercise are two established ways to increase, maintain, and support BMD throughout the lifespan, while also mitigating fall and fracture risk. Calcium plays a critical role in building and maintaining healthy bone, and vitamin D facilitates proper absorption of calcium. Although both are available as supplements, dietary intake is the preferred way to satisfy the daily consumption recommendations. Dairy products have a particularly high calcium content and are invaluable to a calcium-rich diet. However, it is difficult to achieve sufficient circulating levels of vitamin D from diet alone.

Thus, the National Academy of Medicine recommends, and clinical societies that engage bone health also endorse, vitamin D supplementation for all children, adolescents, and young adults. Since the release of this recommendation in 2010, investigations continue to elucidate associations between vitamin D and bone health outcomes.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137xVeb]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether increasing calcium intake from dietary sources affects bone mineral density (BMD) and, if so, whether the effects are similar to those of calcium supplements.

Design Random effects meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data sources Ovid Medline, Embase, Pubmed, and references from relevant systematic reviews. Initial searches were undertaken in July 2013 and updated in September 2014.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements (with or without vitamin D) in participants aged over 50 with BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, total body, or forearm as an outcome.

Results We identified 59 eligible randomised controlled trials: 15 studied dietary sources of calcium (n = 1533) and 51 studied calcium supplements (n = 12 257). Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increased BMD by 0.6–1.0% at the total hip and total body at one year and by 0.7–1.8% at these sites and the lumbar spine and femoral neck at two years. There was no effect on BMD in the forearm. Calcium supplements increased BMD by 0.7–1.8% at all five skeletal sites at one, two, and over two and a half years, but the size of the increase in BMD at later time points was similar to the increase at one year. Increases in BMD were similar in trials of dietary sources of calcium and calcium supplements (except at the forearm), in trials of calcium monotherapy versus co-administered calcium and vitamin D, in trials with calcium doses of ≥ 1000 versus < 1000 mg/day and ≤ 500 versus > 500 mg/day, and in trials where the baseline dietary calcium intake was < 800 versus ≥ 800 mg/day.

Conclusions Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources or by taking calcium supplements produces small non-progressive increases in BMD, which are unlikely to lead to a clinically significant reduction in risk of fracture.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111RTyG4]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025. Within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living, and 20% to 30% of patients will die.

Objective

To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults (defined as not living in a nursing home or other institutional care setting). The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture.

Findings

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D or greater than 1000 mg of calcium to prevent fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium increases the incidence of kidney stones.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (D recommendation) These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

### Osteoporosis: part I. evaluation and assessment [^112FGvX9]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis afflicts 75 million persons in the United States, Europe and Japan and results in more than 1.3 million fractures annually in the United States. Because osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs, family physicians must identify the appropriate timing and methods for screening those at risk. Prevention is the most important step, and women of all ages should be encouraged to take 1,000 to 1,500 mg of supplemental calcium daily, participate in regular weight-bearing exercise, avoid medications known to compromise bone density, institute hormone replacement therapy at menopause unless contraindicated and avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol intake. All postmenopausal women who present with fractures as well as younger women who have risk factors should be evaluated for the disease. Physicians should recommend bone mineral density testing to younger women at risk and postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than being postmenopausal. Bone mineral density testing should be recommended to all women 65 years and older regardless of additional risk factors. Bone mineral density screening should be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment only if the results would influence the choice of therapy or convince the patient to take appropriate preventive measures.

### Therapy of osteoporosis with calcium and vitamin D [^113VKrhZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Inadequate intakes of vitamin D and calcium lead to reduced calcium absorption, higher bone remodeling rates, and increased bone loss. Vitamin D insufficiency has also been linked to reduced muscle function and increased risk of falling. The mechanisms for the performance and muscle effects are not well understood. Administering vitamin D to those with inadequate vitamin D status has been shown to lower fracture rates in some trials but not in others. The purpose of this presentation is (1) to examine how calcium and vitamin D work in concert, (2) to consider key evidence that increasing vitamin D intake will affect risk of falls and fractures, and (3) to estimate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level needed to achieve maximum fracture protection.

Risk assessment and preventive medication — determinants and evidence summary: Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures, and absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit, while evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting; if future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).

### IOM recommends increased calcium intakes… [^112UNaKz]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The first in a series of reports on Dietary Reference Intakes by the Institute of Medicine covers the nutrients associated with bone growth and osteoporosis. The report, "Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride, " recommends intake levels for U. S. and Canadian individuals and population groups and, for the first time, sets upper level guidelines to reduce the risk of adverse health effects from consuming too much of a nutrient. The new guidelines have different age categories, nutritional measures and recommended intake levels. The most significant changes in the report were seen with calcium. According to the new guidelines, Americans and Canadians should consume between 1, 000 and 1, 300 mg of calcium per day.

Children and adolescents nine to 18 years of age and adults over the age of 50 years need calcium in the higher range, a substantial increase from the amount recommended in previous guidelines for these age groups. The calcium recommendations were set at levels associated with maximum retention of body calcium, because bones that are rich in calcium are known to be less susceptible to fractures. In addition to calcium consumption, other factors that are thought to affect bone retention of calcium and risk of osteoporosis include high rates of growth in children during specific periods, hormonal status, exercise genetics and other diet components. and a tolerable upper intake level were established for calcium. The upper limit for calcium is 2, 500 mg per day for all persons one year of age and older.

The upper limit figure is not intended by the IOM to be a recommended level of intake, and the IOM stresses that there is no established benefit for individuals to consume nutrients at levels above the RDA or AI. The tolerable upper intake level refers to total intakes from food, fortified food and nutrient supplements. The EAR is an intake that meets the estimated nutrient need of one half of the individuals in a specific group. The DRIs were derived by a panel of experts appointed by the National Academy of Sciences who spent one year reviewing the scientific studies of the various nutrients associated with bone growth and osteoporosis. The panel considered the roles of these nutrients in decreasing the risk of chronic and other diseases and conditions and interpreted the current data on intakes in the U. S. and Canadian population groups.

Fundamental measures for bone health — lifestyle and nonpharmacologic strategies emphasize nutrition, exercise, fall-risk reduction, and functional training. "Several lifestyle modifications may improve musculoskeletal integrity and balance, preserve bone strength, and prevent future fractures". These include "adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D; lifelong participation in regular, weight-bearing, resistance, and balance-improving exercises to minimize falls; avoiding use of tobacco and excessive use of alcohol; and elimination of potential risk factors for falling". This "bone healthy" lifestyle is "important for everyone", and "Patients with osteoporosis may benefit from physical therapy or other activities and other nonpharmacologic measures to improve strength and reduce the risk of falls and fractures". Goals include "Optimize skeletal development and maximize peak bone mass at skeletal maturity; Maintain skeletal mass and prevent age-related bone loss; Preserve the structural integrity of the skeleton; Prevent falls and fractures".

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QpSGV]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

The absence of any interaction with baseline dietary calcium intake or a dose-response relation suggests that increasing intake through dietary sources or through supplements does not correct a dietary deficiency (in which case greater effects would be seen in those with the lowest intakes or the highest doses). An alternative possibility is that increasing calcium intake has a weak anti-resorptive effect. Calcium supplements reduce markers of bone formation and resorption by about 20%, and increasing milk intake also reduces bone turnover by a similar amount. Suppression of bone turnover by this amount might lead to the small observed increases in BMD.

Increases in BMD of about 1–2% over one to five years are unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in fractures. The average rate of BMD loss in older post-menopausal women is about 1% a year. So the effect of increasing calcium intake is to prevent about one to two years of normal BMD loss, and if calcium intake is increased for more than one year it will slow down but not stop BMD loss. Epidemiological studies suggest that a decrease in BMD of one standard deviation is associated with an increase in the relative risk of fracture of about 1.5–2.0. A one standard deviation change in BMD is about equivalent to a 10% change in BMD. Based on these calculations, a 10% increase in BMD would be associated with a 33–50% reduction in risk of fracture. Therefore, the 1–2% increase in BMD observed with increased calcium intake would be predicted to produce a 5–10% reduction in risk of fracture. These estimates are consistent with findings from randomised controlled trials of other agents. The modest increases in BMD with increased calcium intake are smaller than observed with weak anti-resorptive agents such as etidronateand raloxifene. Etidronate, however, does not reduce vertebral or non-vertebral fractures, and raloxifene reduces vertebral but not non-vertebral fractures. In contrast, potent anti-resorptive agents such as alendronate, zoledronate, and denosumab increase BMD by 6–9% at the spine and 5–6% at the hip over three years. These changes are associated with reductions of 44–70% in vertebral fracture, 35–41% in hip fracture, and 15–25% in non-vertebral fractures. The magnitude of fracture reduction predicted by the small increases in BMD we observed with increased calcium intake are also consistent with the findings of our systematic review of calcium supplements and fracture. We observed small (< 15%) inconsistent reductions in total and vertebral fracture overall but no reductions in fractures in the large randomised controlled trials at lowest risk of bias and no reductions in forearm or hip fractures.

Clinical considerations — general management in adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis: Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating adults with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures, noting that there are many available risk assessment tools with varying predictive value, which were not evaluated in the systematic review or in this guideline.

Calcium safety and upper limits — In a Swedish prospective longitudinal cohort, calcium intake of more than 1,500 mg/day was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.67) for all-cause mortality, and a large study raised concerns about nephrolithiasis although the absolute risk of kidney stones was small (2.5% in the calcium-supplemented group versus 2.1% in the control group) with a mean total calcium intake of ∼2,100 mg. A study of more than 9,000 participants followed for 10 years found that postmenopausal women taking 500 to 1,000 mg of supplemental calcium had a significant survival advantage over women not taking supplements, while low dietary calcium intake (< 700 mg/day compared with 1,400 mg/day) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risks and a meta-analysis found no effect of calcium supplements on cardiovascular risk. In summary, studies to date suggest that dietary calcium may be preferred over supplemental calcium and that total calcium intake should not exceed 1,500 mg/day; increasing calcium intake beyond the recommended levels has not been shown to be useful and may be harmful.

Key Points for Practice
- Routine exercise, including aerobic and resistance activities, helps prevent bone loss; exercise also helps prevent falls in older adults.
- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to reduce fracture risk.
- Bone density screening is recommended for all postmenopausal patients 65 years and older. Younger patients with an estimated fracture risk of greater than 8. 4% also benefit from screening. Osteoporosis Prevention Exercise helps prevent bone loss and is an important consideration in osteoporosis prevention counseling. Resistance and high-impact or weight-bearing exercises are most effective and are safe in patients with osteopenia. A walking regimen also may be helpful. The National Academy of Medicine recommends 600 IU daily of vitamin D from food in patients up to 70 years of age and 800 IU in those older than 70 years.

For calcium, they recommend 1, 000 mg daily for adults up to 50 years of age, increasing to 1, 200 mg daily for those older than 50 years. Because supplements do not reduce fractures, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against supplementing with 1, 000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D in postmenopausal women. The evidence is insufficient for larger doses and supplementation in premenopausal women. Osteoporosis Screening Bone density screening is recommended in postmenopausal patients 65 years and older to decrease fractures. For younger patients with at least one risk factor, screening is recommended if the fracture risk is greater than 8. 4% using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Risk factors include alcohol use; body mass index less than 20 kg per m. 2 or weight less than 127 lb; parental history of hip or spine fracture; smoking; secondary bone loss from medical conditions (i.e., anorexia nervosa, diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2, diminished ovarian reserve or primary ovarian insufficiency, gastric bypass, HIV, hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis Osteoporosis is diagnosed in a patient with any of the following: T-score of −2. 5 or less for hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, or distal third of radius History of fragility fracture, including incidental or asymptomatic vertebral fracture T-score between −1. 0 and −2. 5 and increased risk of fracture determined by risk assessment tool.

Calcium supplement formulations and dosing — Calcium carbonate has a generous calcium content (40%), may cause gastrointestinal complaints, requires gastric acid for absorption, and is best absorbed when taken with meals, whereas calcium citrate has a lower calcium content (21%), absorption is not dependent on gastric acid, and it may be less likely to cause GI complaints; in addition to tablets, chewable supplements as well as gummy preparations are available. For optimal absorption, calcium supplementation should not exceed 500 to 600 mg per dose, irrespective of the preparation, and for patients requiring more than 600 mg of calcium supplement daily, the dose should be divided.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111Rh7Pe]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Nutrition — calcium and vitamin D in postmenopausal women notes that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed daily intakes of calcium for postmenopausal women were 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg, with an upper limit of 2,000 mg. Average dietary calcium intake in postmenopausal women in the United States and Canada is 700 mg to 800 mg, about one-third from dairy, so an average dairy-free diet contains up to 500 mg. Few healthy women need to take more than 500 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM-recommended daily intake. No serious adverse events have been observed with dietary calcium intake of less than 600 mg, and larger daily intakes are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and constipation. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Calcium and Vitamin D Study the average dietary calcium intake was about 1,100 mg daily, and adding 1,000 mg of a calcium supplement daily increased the risk of kidney stones by 17%. Although a clinical trial and a meta-analysis raised the possibility that a supplement of 1,000 mg daily (total daily intake approximately 2,000 mg) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, that association was not observed in the WHI, and a subsequent meta-analysis found that 2,000 mg to 2,500 mg per day was not associated with cardiovascular risk in healthy adults. In the absence of proof of benefit, a total daily calcium intake of more than 1,200 mg is not recommended for healthy postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis.

### Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis, and therapy [^111Yb22R]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas.

Participants

From March 27–29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research.

Evidence

MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks.

Conclusions

Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.

USPSTF recommendation — burden of osteoporotic fractures in U.S. adults is substantial: Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in 2005 with incidence projected to more than 3 million by 2025; nearly half of women older than 50 years will experience a fracture; from 2004–2014 hip fractures accounted for approximately 300 000 hospitalizations annually; during the first 3 months after a hip fracture mortality risk is 5 to 8 times that of peers without fracture; and nearly 20% subsequently receive long-term care.

### The role of calcium in peri-and postmenopausal women: consensus opinion of the North American Menopause Society [^114e1H1A]. Menopause (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) established a goal to review the published medical data and develop an evidence-based consensus opinion regarding the role of calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

In building this consensus opinion, NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines. As part of that process, NAMS appointed a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of calcium. Their advice was used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in developing this consensus opinion.

Results

Adequate calcium intake (in the presence of adequate vitamin D intake) has been shown to prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk in peri- and postmenopausal women. Although calcium is not as effective as antiresorptive agents (e.g., estrogen, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, or bisphosphonates), it is an essential component of antiresorptive agent therapy for osteoporosis. Calcium has also been associated with beneficial effects in several nonskeletal disorders, primarily hypertension, colorectal cancer, obesity, and nephrolithiasis, although the extent of those effects and mechanisms involved have not been fully explored. Estimates of adequate intakes of calcium for peri- and postmenopausal women are based on evidence relating to osteoporosis prevention. At least 1,200 mg/day of calcium is required for most women; levels greater than 2,500 mg/day are not recommended. To ensure adequate calcium absorption, a daily intake of 400–600 IU of vitamin D is recommended, either through sun exposure or through diet or supplementation. Since no accurate test to determine calcium deficiency exists, clinicians should focus instead on ensuring that a woman consumes enough calcium to meet the recommended levels.

Conclusion

Although the most definitive role for calcium in peri- and postmenopausal women is in bone health, it is clear that adequate calcium intake has implications that encompass a woman's overall health. Based on the available evidence, a strong statement can be made regarding the importance of ensuring adequate calcium intake in all women, particularly those in peri- or postmenopause.

### Vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115esJi]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are recommended for the prevention of fracture, but previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting results, with uncertainty about optimal doses and regimens for supplementation and their overall effectiveness.

Objective

To assess the risks of fracture associated with differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in observational studies and the risks of fracture associated with supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium in RCTs.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and other RCT databases were searched from database inception until December 31, 2018. Searches were performed between July 2018 and December 2018.

Study Selection

Observational studies involving at least 200 fracture cases and RCTs enrolling at least 500 participants and reporting at least 10 incident fractures were included. Randomized clinical trials compared vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium with control.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two researchers independently extracted data according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and assessed possible bias. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Data extraction and synthesis took place between July 2018 and June 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Any fracture and hip fracture.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (39 141 participants, 6278 fractures, 2367 hip fractures), each increase of 10.0 ng/mL (ie, 25 nmol/L) in 25 (OH)D concentration was associated with an adjusted RR for any fracture of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.96) and an adjusted RR for hip fracture of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.86). A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (34 243 participants, 2843 fractures, 740 hip fractures) of vitamin D supplementation alone (daily or intermittent dose of 400–30 000 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 8.4 ng/mL) did not find a reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98–1.14) or hip fracture (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98–1.32), but these trials were constrained by infrequent intermittent dosing, low daily doses of vitamin D, or an inadequate number of participants. In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (49 282 participants, 5449 fractures, 730 hip fractures) of combined supplementation with vitamin D (daily doses of 400–800 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 9.2 ng/mL) and calcium (daily doses of 1000–1200 mg) found a 6% reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99) and a 16% reduced risk of hip fracture (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone was associated with reduced risk of fracture, but daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium was a more promising strategy.

### Vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UkEoz]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the available evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation for reducing the risk of fracture?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of vitamin D alone (11 randomized clinical trials with 34 243 participants) showed no significant association with risk of any fracture or of hip fracture. In contrast, daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium (6 randomized clinical trials with 49 282 participants) was associated with a 16% reduced risk of hip fracture.

Meaning

In this study, neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone was associated with reduced risk of fracture, but daily treatment with both vitamin D and calcium was a more promising strategy.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1145srXR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — calcium intake recommendation and supporting evidence: We recommend that men with or at risk for osteoporosis consume 1000–1200 mg calcium daily, ideally from dietary sources, with calcium supplements added if dietary calcium is insufficient. Evidence notes no benefit for BMD from calcium/vitamin D supplementation in well-nourished men with mean dietary calcium intake > 1000 mg/d, but increases in BMD were seen in healthy older men given calcium and vitamin D supplements; calcium- and vitamin D-fortified milk increased BMD and improved femoral bone structure in older men. Observational data indicate dietary calcium was not related to fractures in men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, whereas low dietary calcium intake was associated with higher fracture risk in a cohort of Australian men.

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^1163xWiY]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Older men and women are recommended to take at least 1000–1200 mg/day of calcium for bone health and prevention of fractures. The average intake in the diet in Western countries is 700–900 mg/day, and lower in Asia and Africa, meaning that most older people would need to take calcium supplements to meet these recommendations. These guidelines for calcium intake have been widely implemented, and, in some Western countries, more than 30–50% of older women take calcium supplements. Clinical trials of calcium supplements at doses of 1000 mg/day, however, have reported adverse effects, including cardiovascular events, kidney stones, and hospital admissions for acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Consequently, older people have been encouraged to improve bone health by increasing their calcium intake through food rather than by taking supplements. This advice assumes that increasing dietary calcium intake to the recommended level of > 1200 mg/day prevents fractures without causing the adverse effects of calcium supplements.

We assessed the evidence supporting the recommendation to increase dietary calcium intake to prevent fractures and compared the anti-fracture efficacy of increasing calcium intake through dietary sources with the anti-fracture efficacy of calcium supplements. We undertook a systematic review of studies of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements in older adults (> 50) with fracture as an endpoint. We primarily focused on the results of randomised controlled trials, but when insufficient evidence from such trials was available, we considered results of observational studies.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. VII. meta-analysis of calcium supplementation for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^116jJXMZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize controlled trials examining the effect of calcium on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1998 and the Cochrane Controlled Register up to 2000, and we examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings. We contacted osteoporosis investigators to identify additional studies, and primary authors for unpublished data.

Study Selection

We included 15 trials (1806 patients) that randomized postmenopausal women to calcium supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet and reported bone mineral density of the total body, vertebral spine, hip, or forearm, or recorded the number of fractures, and followed patients for at least 1 yr.

Data Extraction

For each trial, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and extracted data.

Data Synthesis

We found calcium to be more effective than placebo in reducing rates of bone loss after two or more years of treatment. The pooled difference in percentage change from baseline was 2.05% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24–3.86] for total body bone density, 1.66% (95% CI 0.92–2.39) for the lumbar spine, 1.64% (95% CI 0.70–2.57) for the hip, and 1.91% (95% CI 0.33–3.50) for the distal radius. The relative risk (RR) of fractures of the vertebrae was 0.77, with a wide CI (95% CI 0.54–1.09); the RR for nonvertebral fractures was 0.86 (95% CI 0.43–1.72).

Conclusions

Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density. The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures, but do not meaningfully address the possible effect of calcium on reducing the incidence of nonvertebral fractures.

### Americans are not meeting current calcium recommendations [^115yb49y]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent research has raised doubts about the efficacy of calcium supplementation in preventing fractures; however, adequate calcium intake remains important.

Objective

Using data from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we assessed dietary and supplemental calcium consumption among US men and women according to risk of osteoporosis and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

Design

We categorized risk of osteoporosis as high (having an osteoporosis diagnosis or treatment), moderate (aged > 50 y), or low (aged 19–50 y). Main study outcomes included milligrams of dietary and supplemental calcium intake, likelihood of meeting national calcium adequate intake (AI) levels, and likelihood of taking supplemental calcium.

Results

Mean (95% CI) total calcium consumption was 944 (846, 1043) mg in the high-risk group, 821 (788, 854) mg in the moderate-risk group, and 846 (812, 871) mg in the low-risk group. Overall, 40% of the sample met the calcium AI amount and 48% reported taking supplemental calcium. After adjustment for daily caloric intake, the greater likelihood of meeting calcium AI levels was associated with [odds ratio (95% CI)] low [versus moderate, 1.5 (1.2, 1.7)] and high [versus moderate, 1.9 (1.3, 2.6)] osteoporosis risk, female sex [1.6 (1.3, 1.8)], non-Hispanic white ethnicity [versus nonwhite, 1.9 (1.7, 2.3)], and education beyond high school [versus less than high school, 1.5 (1.2, 1.9)]. These same factors were also associated with an increased likelihood of taking supplemental calcium, except for a consistent increase with higher osteoporosis risk.

Conclusion

Many Americans — particularly men, ethnic minorities, and the socially disadvantaged — are not meeting the current recommendations for adequate calcium intake through diet alone or with supplements.

### Calcium supplements: benefits and risks [^115zM1Uq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium is an essential element in the diet, but there is continuing controversy regarding its optimal intake, and its role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Most studies show little evidence of a relationship between calcium intake and bone density, or the rate of bone loss. Re-analysis of data from the placebo group from the Auckland Calcium Study demonstrates no relationship between dietary calcium intake and rate of bone loss over 5 years in healthy older women with intakes varying from < 400 to > 1500 mg day(-1). Thus, supplements are not needed within this range of intakes to compensate for a demonstrable dietary deficiency, but might be acting as weak anti-resorptive agents via effects on parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. Consistent with this, supplements do acutely reduce bone resorption and produce small short-term effects on bone density, without evidence of a cumulative density benefit. As a result, anti-fracture efficacy remains unproven, with no evidence to support hip fracture prevention (other than in a cohort with severe vitamin D deficiency) and total fracture numbers are reduced by 0–10%, depending on which meta-analysis is considered. Five recent large studies have failed to demonstrate fracture prevention in their primary analyses. This must be balanced against an increase in gastrointestinal side effects (including a doubling of hospital admissions for these problems), a 17% increase in renal calculi and a 20–40% increase in risk of myocardial infarction. Each of these adverse events alone neutralizes any possible benefit in fracture prevention. Thus, calcium supplements appear to have a negative risk-benefit effect, and so should not be used routinely in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.

### Effect of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation on fall prevention: a systematic review and updated network meta-analysis [^114oYDE5]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls and fall-related injuries are common and potentially preventable causes of functional disability, morbidity, and increased health-care utilization among older individuals. It was reported that one of every three individuals over 65 years of age has experienced at least one fall, with 5–6% of falls resulting in a fracture. Therefore, fall prevention is paramount for preventing fractures and reducing morbidity and mortality. Fall prevention guidelines have recommended vitamin D as a component of multifactorial interventions along with other strategies such as gait and balance training, home assessment and modifications, reduction or withdrawal of psychotropic drugs, treatment of impaired vision, management of postural hypotension, treatment of heart rate and abnormal heart rhythm, suitable footwear, and education.

Vitamin D supplements are commonly taken to maintain bone health. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommends a daily intake of 800 to 1000 units of vitamin D for adults aged 50 years and older. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 International Unit (IU) for adults < 70 years of age and 800 IU for those ≥ 70 years of age.

However, previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown inconsistent effectiveness of vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation in fall prevention, which may be attributed to differences in vitamin D doses, mode of administration, and other regimen design features. Previous systematic review and meta-analyses also had different recommendations. A recent meta-analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation had no impact on the incidence of fractures or falls nor clinically meaningful effects on bone mineral density. On the other hand, Wu et al. found that vitamin D combined with calcium, but not vitamin D2 or D3 alone, significant lowered the risk of falls. Similarly, Thanapluetiwong et al. showed that vitamin D3 decreased the incidence of falls only when supplemented with calcium, but neither of the two articles conducted subgroup analysis of different vitamin D doses. Kong et al. revealed that 800–1000 IU/d of vitamin D was associated with lower risks of falls. Ling et al. reported that combined supplementation of vitamin D (daily doses of 700–1000 IU) and calcium resulted in 12% reduction in the risk of falls. Furthermore, Wei et al. found that 700–2000 IU/d of vitamin D was correlated with a lower risk of falls among ambulatory and institutionalized older adults.

### Prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113a9RqG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone strength and increased risk for fractures. Fragility fractures are associated with serious clinical consequences, including chronic pain, skeletal deformities, loss of independence, and increased mortality. Although osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated, many who are treated take medication incorrectly or do not continue it long enough to benefit. Measures to prevent osteoporosis include a healthy lifestyle, with regular physical activity, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, and avoidance of cigarette smoking and excess alcohol. Patients at risk for osteoporosis can be diagnosed with a simple bone density test before the first fracture occurs. Pharmacologic agents for patients at high risk for fracture can reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — primary prevention of fractures with vitamin D and calcium in community-dwelling adults: The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women (I statement). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women (I statement). These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

### Calcium supplementation on bone loss in postmenopausal women [^1143imE9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although calcium is one the simplest and least expensive strategies for preventing osteoporotic fractures calcium supplementation is nevertheless not without controversy (Kanis 1989; Nordin 1990). The Food and Drug Administration in the US has permitted a bone health claim for calcium-rich foods, and the NIH in its Consensus Development Process approved a statement that high calcium intake reduces the risk of osteoporosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of calcium on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Controlled Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 2001, and examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

Selection Criteria

Trials that randomized postmenopausal women to calcium supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet and reported bone mineral density of the total body, vertebral spine, hip, or forearm or recorded the number of fractures, and followed patients for at least one year were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality and extracted data for each trial. For each bone density site (lumbar spine, total body, combined hip and combined forearm), we calculated the weighted mean difference in bone density between treatment and control groups using the percentage change from baseline. We constructed regression models in which the independent variables were year and dose, and the dependent variable was the effect size. This regression was used to determine the years across which pooling was appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed. For each fracture analysis we calculated a risk ratio.

Main Results

Fifteen trials, representing 1806 participants, were included. Calcium was more effective than placebo in reducing rates of bone loss after two or more years of treatment. The pooled difference in percentage change from baseline was 2.05% (95% CI 0.24 to 3.86) for total body bone density, 1.66% (95% CI 0.92 to 2.39) for the lumbar spine at 2 years, 1.60% (95% CI 0.78 to 2.41) for the hip, and 1.91% (95% CI 0.33 to 3.50) for the distal radius. The relative risk of fractures of the vertebrae was 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.09); the relative risk for non-vertebral fractures was 0.86 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.72).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density. The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures, but it is unclear if calcium reduces the incidence of non vertebral fractures.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^116FLEB6]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis

Recent evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of trials in community living older adults found that vitamin D or calcium supplementation did not reduce the risk of hip fracture or total fracture, whereas another meta-analysis reported that while vitamin D alone did not reduce fracture risk, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation decreased the relative risk of hip fracture (16%) and all fractures (6%) among older adults. Ongoing research is assessing the effect of high dose vitamin D supplements on several health outcomes, including fractures, but a recent three year trial of 400, 4000, or 10 000 IU/day reported that the higher doses reduced volumetric bone density, suggesting potential for harm. In the absence of clear evidence on supplementation, it is prudent to ensure that dietary recommendations on calcium and vitamin D intakes are met through food and supplementation.

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^116ykzHb]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results in context

Overall, there is little evidence currently to suggest an association between calcium intake and fracture risk or that increasing calcium intake through dietary sources will alter risk. Although calcium supplements produced some small inconsistent reductions in fractures, the doses used of 500–1600 mg/day gave an average total daily calcium intake of 1780 mg/day (range 1230–2314 mg/day). This is considerably higher than the dietary calcium intake in the highest quarter or fifth in the prospective observational studies. If calcium supplements are correcting dietary "calcium deficiency" it might be necessary to increase dietary calcium intake to about 1800 mg/day to achieve equivalent effects to calcium supplements. Dietary manipulation to increase calcium intake by ≥ 1000 mg/day or to achieve total daily intakes of this size is unlikely to be sustainable.

The pooled analyses of all randomised controlled trials showed reductions in risk with calcium supplements for all fractures (by 11%) and vertebral fractures (by 14%). The incidence of vertebral fracture and any fracture in the control groups in our pooled analyses was 1.5% and 12%, respectively, after a participant weighted average duration of follow-up of 6.2 and 5.5 years, respectively. With these values and the observed risk reductions from the meta-analyses, the number needed to treat (NNT) with calcium to prevent one vertebral fracture is 489 for 6.2 years and to prevent one fracture at any site is 77 for 5.5 years. These benefits are unlikely to be attractive for an individual and would be even smaller for individuals at lower risk of fracture, who are often advised to take calcium supplements, or if relative risks from the randomised controlled trials at lowest risk of bias were used in the calculations. There was no benefit from calcium supplements for hip fractures, which have the greatest clinical consequences.

### Dietary calcium intake and risk of fracture and osteoporosis: prospective longitudinal cohort study [^111MUVpr]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

The large size of this study enabled us to define a threshold of dietary calcium intake with better precision than in previous studies. The results from previous prospective cohort studies on the relation between dietary calcium intake and fracture risk are contradictory. British women older than 50 years had an increased risk of fractures (self reported five years after study entry) at calcium levels below 700 mg compared with a reference level of 1200 mg. Other large prospective cohort studiesand one meta-analysisreported no association between calcium intake and fracture risk.

Vitamin D enhances the renal conservation and intestinal absorption of calcium. Our results suggest that the optimal level for calcium intake for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture is higher when dietary vitamin D intake is low. This finding has not been shownor investigatedin previous prospective studies but accords with findings in randomised co-supplementation trials. Circulating vitamin D levels are only to a lesser extent determined by the dietary intake of vitamin D. Nonetheless, dietary calcium intake was only associated with bone mineral density in women with serum vitamin D values less than 50 nmol/L in the large NHANES III cohort.

### Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women [^111z9NC4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, a disease of increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly common as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. Vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with a mean age of approximately 63 years. In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes of between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200–1300 mg of calcium daily, with increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and decreased nonvertebral fractures. The decreases in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. There are insufficient available data supporting a benefit from vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.

### Osteoporosis: part II. nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment [^11599h6k]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Family physicians will frequently encounter patients with osteoporosis, a condition that is often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Treatment of the fracture can be initiated without further diagnostic testing. Thereafter, treatment of osteoporosis includes (1) prevention of further bone loss through weight-bearing exercise, tobacco and alcohol avoidance, hormone replacement therapy in women, and raloxifene and calcium supplementation; (2) treatment of fracture-related pain with analgesics and calcitonin; (3) building bone mass when feasible with alendronate; and (4) modifying behaviors that increase the risk of falls. Patients without fracture who are at risk for osteoporosis can also benefit from these preventive measures. Furthermore, women of all ages should be encouraged to maintain a daily calcium intake of 1,000 to 1,500 mg and to participate in weight-bearing exercise for 30 minutes three times weekly to reduce their risk of falls and fractures. Persons at risk should avoid medications known to compromise bone density, such as glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and chronic heparin therapy.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nCf3X]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Maintaining a calcium intake of at least 1000–1200 mg/day has long been recommended for older individuals to treat and prevent osteoporosis. Calcium supplements are commonly taken to achieve such intakes, which are considerably higher than the average intake of calcium in the diet in older people in Western countries, around 700–900 mg/day. Recently, concerns have emerged about the risk-benefit profile of calcium supplements. The small reductions in total fracturesseem outweighed by the moderate risk of minor side effects such as constipation, coupled with the small risk of severe side effects such as cardiovascular events, kidney stones, and admission to hospital with acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Consequently, some experts have recommended that older people increase their calcium intake through their diet and take supplements only when that is not feasible. In a systematic review of calcium intake and fractures, we concluded that there was no evidence of an association between increased dietary calcium intake and lower risk of fracture. We identified only two small randomised controlled trials of dietary calcium intake that reported fracture as an outcome. Numerous cohort studies, however, assessed the relation between dietary calcium, milk or dairy intake, and risk of fracture, and most reported neutral associations.

The putative mechanism by which calcium intake affects bone health is by increasing bone mineral density (BMD). BMD is a surrogate endpoint for fracture risk that allows biological effects to be explored in randomised controlled trials of modest size. We investigated whether the results of randomised controlled trials with BMD as an endpoint support the recommendations to increase dietary calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements in older adults (aged > 50) to determine whether increasing intake from dietary sources has effects on BMD and, if so, whether they are similar to the effects of calcium supplements on BMD.

### Vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zYBPA]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the available evidence from completed RCTs provided no support for the effects of vitamin D alone on prevention of fracture, but most of these RCTs were constrained by methodological problems. Meta-analyses of ongoing RCTs assessing the effects of higher daily doses of vitamin D on fracture risk are needed before making recommendations on the use of vitamin D for prevention of fracture. Further RCTs are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of higher daily doses of vitamin D with calcium in high-risk individuals for prevention of fracture.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114v5tN6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — calcium intake and safety reports that the Institute of Medicine recommends a calcium intake of 1000 mg/d for men aged 51–70 and 1200 mg/d for men (and women) older than 70. In clinical trials for osteoporosis in men, calcium (500–1000 mg/d) and vitamin D [400–1200 IU/d (10–30 μg/d)] supplementation was provided for all subjects. A meta-analysis in women showed that calcium supplements may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction but no other cardiovascular end points or death, and this finding has not been confirmed in men. In older women, calcium supplementation increases the risk of kidney stones; although the prevalence of kidney stones is higher in men than in women, no increase in kidney stones has been demonstrated in men at the level of calcium intake recommended for optimal bone health. An observational study suggested a higher risk of metastatic prostate cancer in men receiving high doses of supplemental calcium (1500–2000 mg/d), but this has not been substantiated in clinical trials.

### The role of calcium in osteoporosis drug therapy [^115x68t4]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Great advances have been made in the field of osteoporosis treatment and prevention in recent years that have led to the availability of powerful new drugs. These drugs are viewed by patients and physicians as a major breakthrough in the management of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, this view has led many to ignore the importance of concurrent calcium supplementation to ensure the maximum benefit from these drugs, as evidenced by the recent decline in use of calcium supplements. As the majority of patients fail to consume the minimum recommended dietary intake of calcium, it is critical to recommend calcium supplements to raise total daily calcium intake to the levels needed to ensure maximum efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Furthermore, osteoporosis drug labeling should be strengthened to encourage proper use of these drugs in combination with calcium supplements.

Discussion

Principal findings

Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources slightly increased bone mineral density (BMD) (by 0.6–1.8%) over one to two years at all sites, except the forearm where there was no effect. Calcium supplements increased BMD to a similar degree at all sites and all time points (by 0.7–1.8%). In the randomised controlled trials of calcium supplements, the increases in BMD were present by one year, but there were no further subsequent increases. Thus the increases from baseline at both two and over two and half years at each site were similar to the increases at one year. The increases in BMD with dietary sources of calcium were similar to the increases with calcium supplements, except at the forearm, in both direct comparisons of the two interventions in multi-arm studies and in indirect comparisons of the two interventions through subgroup analyses. The increases in BMD were similar in trials of calcium monotherapy and CaD, consistent with a recent meta-analysis reporting that vitamin D monotherapy had no effect on BMD. There were no differences in changes in BMD in our subgroup analyses between trials with calcium doses of ≥ 1000 mg/day and < 1000 mg/day or doses of ≤ 500 mg/day and > 500 mg/day, and in populations with baseline dietary calcium intake of < 800 mg/day and ≥ 800 mg/day. Overall, the results suggest that increasing calcium intake, whether from dietary sources or by taking calcium supplements, provides a small non-progressive increase in BMD, without any ongoing reduction in rates of BMD loss beyond one year. The similar effect of increased dietary intake and supplements suggests that the non-calcium components of the dietary sources of calcium do not directly affect BMD.

### Use of calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures and bone loss in people aged 50 years and older: a meta-analysis [^112jxWt4]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether calcium supplementation can reduce osteoporotic fractures is uncertain. We did a meta-analysis to include all the randomised trials in which calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D, was used to prevent fracture and osteoporotic bone loss.

Methods

We identified 29 randomised trials (n = 63 897) using electronic databases, supplemented by a hand-search of reference lists, review articles, and conference abstracts. All randomised trials that recruited people aged 50 years or older were eligible. The main outcomes were fractures of all types and percentage change of bone-mineral density from baseline. Data were pooled by use of a random-effect model.

Findings

In trials that reported fracture as an outcome (17 trials, n = 52 625), treatment was associated with a 12% risk reduction in fractures of all types (risk ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.95; p = 0.0004). In trials that reported bone-mineral density as an outcome (23 trials, n = 41 419), the treatment was associated with a reduced rate of bone loss of 0.54% (0.35–0.73; p < 0.0001) at the hip and 1.19% (0.76–1.61%; p < 0.0001) in the spine. The fracture risk reduction was significantly greater (24%) in trials in which the compliance rate was high (p < 0.0001). The treatment effect was better with calcium doses of 1200 mg or more than with doses less than 1200 mg (0.80 vs 0.94; p = 0.006), and with vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more than with doses less than 800 IU (0.84 vs 0.87; p = 0.03).

Interpretation

Evidence supports the use of calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation, in the preventive treatment of osteoporosis in people aged 50 years or older. For best therapeutic effect, we recommend minimum doses of 1200 mg of calcium, and 800 IU of vitamin D (for combined calcium plus vitamin D supplementation).

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^112Bc37V]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.
