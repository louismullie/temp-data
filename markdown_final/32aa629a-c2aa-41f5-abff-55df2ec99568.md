## Question

How long can you take ondansetron for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long ondansetron can be taken for in various situations, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, postoperative nausea and vomiting, radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, acute gastroenteritis, cyclic vomiting syndrome, gastroparesis, pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, and general outpatient nausea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and their recommended durations. Then, I should verify off-label uses and what high-quality guidelines say about duration in those contexts. Next, I will consider safety constraints that might limit duration, such as QT risk, hepatic impairment, and cumulative exposure. Finally, I will synthesize practical, scenario-specific duration recommendations and note any exceptions or monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications and their standard durations, because that anchors the answer. For highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a single 24 mg oral dose 30 minutes before chemotherapy is recommended, with no routine continuation beyond 24 hours, and efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been established for the 32 mg IV regimen, which is no longer recommended due to QT concerns, so duration is effectively 1 day in this setting [^112Wdnaj] [^112NZeYy]. For moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, the labeled regimen is 8 mg orally 30 minutes before chemotherapy, then 8 mg again 8 hours later, followed by 8 mg twice daily for 1 to 2 days after chemotherapy completion, so total duration is typically 2 to 3 days depending on the post-chemotherapy extension [^116NgoL3] [^111NkfDj]. For postoperative nausea and vomiting, ondansetron is given as a single dose either 16 mg orally 1 hour before induction or 4 mg IV at induction or at the end of surgery, with no routine continuation beyond the immediate perioperative window, so duration is a single dose in most cases [^114ra1SG] [^117G8BkC]. For radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, dosing is 8 mg 1 to 2 hours before each fraction, with additional 8 mg doses every 8 hours for 1 to 2 days after completion of radiotherapy, aligning duration with the number of radiotherapy days plus 1 to 2 additional days, which commonly totals 3 to 7 days in practice [^111NkfDj] [^114WFaWq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off-label uses. I should verify what major guidelines say. For acute gastroenteritis, pediatric and adult emergency care literature supports short-course ondansetron to facilitate oral rehydration, typically one dose in the ED with, in some studies, up to three additional daily doses for a total of 1 to 3 days, and routine longer courses are not recommended because benefits are front-loaded and prolonged use adds little value while increasing exposure [^1144S6Gi] [^111eKudx]. For cyclic vomiting syndrome, expert guidelines suggest ondansetron as an abortive during acute episodes with very low certainty evidence; in practice, use is intermittent and episode-limited rather than chronic daily therapy, often spanning 1 to 3 days during attacks, and there is no recommendation for continuous daily prophylaxis with ondansetron in CVS [^1124yvEg] [^115qhuV8]. For gastroparesis, some compendia list 4 to 8 mg orally two to three times daily as a symptomatic option, but high-quality guideline support is limited; when used, it is generally chronic or intermittent for symptom flares, so duration is individualized and often long term, though I should emphasize the evidence base is weaker here and requires careful monitoring for adverse effects with ongoing use [^111yLqQZ]. For nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, ondansetron is sometimes used off-label after failure of first-line agents; when used, it is typically short course and symptom-driven rather than scheduled for weeks, and decisions should weigh potential fetal risks and maternal benefit in shared decision-making, so duration is usually days, not weeks, unless refractory cases are carefully managed by obstetrics [^113nKxGj] [^114qcfpJ].

> I need to check safety constraints that might limit how long ondansetron can be taken, because duration is not purely an efficacy question. Ondansetron can prolong the QT interval in a dose-dependent fashion, and although routine ECG monitoring is not required for every patient, caution is warranted with concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte abnormalities, bradyarrhythmias, or congenital long QT syndrome; this risk becomes more salient with repeated or higher exposures, arguing against unnecessary prolonged use when alternatives exist [^111AZTSp] [^112GSeKt]. In severe hepatic impairment, the total daily dose should not exceed 8 mg due to reduced clearance and prolonged half-life, which indirectly constrains duration because cumulative exposure rises quickly; in renal impairment, no adjustment is recommended, but the label notes no experience beyond first-day administration, so prolonged courses in significant renal disease warrant extra caution even if not absolutely contraindicated [^113UMsgv] [^111SBiMt]. But wait, what if someone proposes continuous daily ondansetron for months? I should double-check that there is no supportive chronic safety data; indeed, outside of selected chronic off-label contexts like gastroparesis, robust data for months-long daily ondansetron are lacking, reinforcing that prolonged therapy should be exceptional, indication-specific, and monitored [^112MpZYh].

> Let me synthesize scenario-specific durations, and I will correct myself if I overgeneralize. For chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, duration is 1 to 3 days depending on emetogenic risk, with single-day prophylaxis for highly emetogenic regimens and 2 to 3 days for moderately emetogenic regimens, consistent with FDA labeling and oncology guidance [^112Wdnaj] [^116NgoL3]. For postoperative nausea and vomiting, duration is a single perioperative dose, with redosing generally not helpful if prophylaxis fails, so routine continuation is not advised [^117G8BkC] [^113wYZFE]. For radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, duration mirrors the treatment course plus 1 to 2 additional days, commonly totaling 3 to 7 days depending on fractionation, which aligns with labeled regimens [^111NkfDj] [^114WFaWq]. For acute gastroenteritis, short-course therapy of 1 to 3 days is reasonable to facilitate rehydration, with no indication for longer daily use beyond the acute illness window [^1144S6Gi] [^111eKudx]. For cyclic vomiting syndrome, use is intermittent and attack-limited, typically 1 to 3 days during episodes, rather than chronic daily therapy [^1124yvEg] [^114xTAjb]. For gastroparesis, when used, therapy may be chronic or as-needed for flares, but this is off-label and should be individualized with attention to adverse effects and limited high-quality evidence [^111yLqQZ]. For pregnancy-related nausea, use is generally short course and rescue-oriented after failure of first-line agents, with duration tailored to symptom control and obstetric oversight [^113nKxGj] [^114qcfpJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ondansetron is never used beyond a week in any setting, but I should verify that exception. In gastroparesis, some patients do receive repeated or chronic ondansetron for refractory nausea, acknowledging the limited evidence base and the need to monitor for QT effects, constipation, and hepatic considerations, so my earlier blanket statement was too rigid and needs this nuance added [^111yLqQZ]. I also need to ensure I note that for multiday chemotherapy, contemporary guidance emphasizes using the 5-HT3 antagonist daily during chemotherapy and for 2 days thereafter, which fits the 2 to 3 day post-chemo window already described, and longer-acting options like granisetron transdermal may reduce pill burden without extending ondansetron beyond its evidence-based window [^113VPKqc].

> Next, I should review practical guardrails clinicians use to decide when to stop. If symptoms resolve, stop; if symptoms persist beyond the expected window for the indication, reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative antiemetics or causes rather than reflexively extending ondansetron, especially given the lack of benefit from redosing after failed prophylaxis in PONV and the plateau in efficacy with repeated 5-HT3 dosing in some CINV contexts [^113wYZFE] [^112DPBwz]. I should confirm that for breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, agents like olanzapine are preferred over simply giving more ondansetron, which supports limiting ondansetron duration and pivoting to different mechanisms when control is inadequate [^116wXUrG].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and reference-aligned. Most ondansetron courses are short, typically 1 to 3 days, tightly linked to the precipitating event such as a chemotherapy cycle, radiotherapy fractionation, surgical episode, or acute gastroenteritis illness, with explicit stop criteria and avoidance of unnecessary continuation. Exceptions include selected chronic off-label uses like gastroparesis where duration is individualized and risk-mitigated, and pregnancy-related nausea where use is intermittent and supervised, all under the umbrella of QT risk awareness and hepatic dosing limits [^111NkfDj] [^1144S6Gi] [^111yLqQZ] [^113UMsgv].

Ondansetron is intended for **short-term use only**, with typical courses of 1–3 days for chemotherapy [^116NgoL3], radiotherapy [^114WFaWq], or postoperative nausea [^115tXq66]. For acute gastroenteritis, a single dose or a short 1–3 day course is recommended [^1144S6Gi] [^111ryig8]. Chronic or prolonged use is not recommended due to **QT prolongation risk** [^111AZTSp] and other adverse effects; if longer therapy is needed, use the lowest effective dose with ECG monitoring and regular clinical review [^112GSeKt].

## Recommended duration of ondansetron use by indication

| **Indication** | **Recommended duration** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) | 1–2 days after chemotherapy completion | FDA-approved regimen: 8 mg PO/IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy, repeated 8 hours later, then 8 mg BID for 1–2 days [^116NgoL3] [^111NkfDj] |
| Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting | 1–2 days after radiotherapy completion | FDA-approved regimen: 8 mg PO/IV 1–2 hours before radiotherapy, then 8 mg every 8 hours for 1–2 days [^111NkfDj] |
| Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) | Single dose pre- or post-induction | FDA-approved regimen: 4 mg IV or 16 mg PO as a single dose [^117BgFxg] [^114ra1SG] |
| Acute gastroenteritis | Single dose or 1–3 days | Pediatric and adult guidelines support short-course use to reduce vomiting and facilitate oral rehydration [^1144S6Gi] |
| Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) | Short-term use during acute episodes | Conditional recommendation for 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) during acute episodes; duration individualized [^1124yvEg] |
| Gastroparesis | Short-term or intermittent use | Off-label; duration individualized based on response and tolerability [^114NBADF] |

## Risks associated with prolonged use

Prolonged ondansetron use increases the risk of:

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Dose-dependent risk, especially with IV formulations or in patients with risk factors [^112GSeKt] [^111AZTSp].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Rare but serious, particularly with other serotonergic drugs.
- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Rare but reported.
- **Hepatic impairment**: Severe hepatic impairment requires dose limitation to 8 mg/day [^113UMsgv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Short-term use**: Guidelines consistently recommend short-term use (≤ 3 days) for most indications, with therapy individualized for chronic conditions.
- **Monitoring**: ECG monitoring is advised for patients with risk factors for QT prolongation or when higher doses are used.
- **Alternative therapies**: For chronic nausea/vomiting, consider alternatives (e.g. metoclopramide, promethazine, or NK1 antagonists) to minimize ondansetron exposure [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Use only if benefits outweigh risks; limited safety data, especially in the first trimester [^notfound].
- **Pediatric patients**: Short-term use is supported; monitor for QT prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms [^113FsTzT].
- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk of QT prolongation; use caution and monitor ECG when indicated [^112GSeKt].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General use**: 1–3 days for most indications (CINV, radiotherapy, PONV, acute gastroenteritis).
- **Chronic conditions**: Individualized, intermittent use with regular clinical review and ECG monitoring when indicated.
- **Avoid prolonged use**: Due to QT prolongation and other adverse effects; consider alternatives for chronic symptoms.

---

Ondansetron is intended for **short-term use** (1–3 days) in most indications, with individualized, intermittent use for chronic conditions. Prolonged use should be avoided due to QT prolongation and other adverse effects; when longer therapy is necessary, use the lowest effective dose with appropriate monitoring.

Discussion and conclusions

The major finding of this study is that palonosetron did not show significant effects on cardiac repolarization, as measured by the QTc interval in an ICH E14 compliant, moxifloxacin-controlled clinical trial. There were also no effects on HR, atrioventricular conduction (PR interval), depolarization (QRS interval duration), or wave morphology. In addition, there was no evidence of any relationship between palonosetron concentration and QT/QTc parameters over a wide concentration range. This study is also in agreement with recently published data in cancer patients, where palonosetron did not show changes in heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) duration.

In contrast, other 5-HT 3 RAs have been reported to cause QTc interval prolongation. A comparative study reported that both dolasetron and ondansetron prolonged the QTc interval. Dolasetron was found to predominantly alter ventricular depolarization (QRS interval duration), whereas ondansetron primarily affected ventricular repolarization as measured by a prolongation of QT and JT. Moreover, two studies comparing granisetron and ondansetron in children reported significant prolongation of the QTc interval with granisetron, but not with ondansetron.

This study was designed using E14 Guidelines to accurately evaluate the potentially significant implications of cardiovascular toxicity, with the specific aim of detecting the persistent and late electrophysiological variations observed with other 5-HT 3 RAs, following the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of palonosetron that is ninefold greater than the current standard dose (2.25 vs 0.25 mg IV). No significant QTc interval prolongations were detected at any time point during the entire study observation period. Supratherapeutic doses of ondansetron and dolasetron both showed a significant dose-dependent effect on the QTc interval for up to 4 h post-administration, corresponding to a steady-state condition.

Investigating supratherapeutic dosages may be of particular interest considering the pharmacokinetic profile of palonosetron. Compared with first-generation 5-HT 3 RAs, palonosetron has a substantially longer half-life (40 h), which together with its differential receptor binding properties may be associated with its long lasting effects. Despite the long exposure to palonosetron, the present thorough QT/QTc E14-compliant trial demonstrated no dose-related cardiotoxicity.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^113tFSV4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Dopamine receptor antagonists — droperidol for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis: the recommended dose is 0.625–1.25 mg (A1) and the optimal timing is the end of surgery (A1). Meta-analyses support its efficacy; in bimaxillary surgery, droperidol 0.3–1 mg had equal efficacy as granisetron 1.0 mg, although both were less effective than a droperidol and granisetron combination. Safety and regulatory notes include an FDA black box warning in 2001 for risk of sudden cardiac death; at PONV doses, QT prolongation potential is similar to ondansetron and, when combined with ondansetron, the risk is comparable to either drug alone. Observational data report no increase in ventricular tachycardia with droperidol 0.625 mg, akathisia risk comparable between ondansetron 4 mg, droperidol 0.625 mg, and droperidol 1.25 mg, and a low rate (0.9%) of adverse events such as extrapyramidal effects (B1).

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, was confirmed.

Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

OVERDOSAGE

There is no specific antidote for ondansetron overdose. Patients should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy. Individual intravenous doses as large as 150 mg and total daily intravenous doses as large as 252 mg have been inadvertently administered without significant adverse events. These doses are more than 10 times the recommended daily dose.

In addition to the adverse events listed above, the following events have been described in the setting of ondansetron overdose: "Sudden blindness" (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes' duration plus severe constipation occurred in 1 patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose. Hypotension (and faintness) occurred in a patient that took 48 mg of ondansetron tablets. Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4-minute period, a vasovagal episode with transient second-degree heart block was observed. In all instances, the events resolved completely.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^113FsTzT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TRADE‐OFFS: BALANCING BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ONDANSETRON

The assessment has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary editorial board of the DPF consisting of pediatricians, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacologists.

Benefits clinically relevant?

Improved efficacy of oral rehydration preventing hospital admission is considered clinically relevant. Drug therapy should only be considered if the child is at high risk for dehydration and oral rehydration is not successful.

Residual risks acceptable?

The multidisciplinary board discussed if pre‐emptive ECG testing is indicated for use in gastroenteritis. Daily practice is quite pragmatic: parents are asked for their family history of cardiac events and comedications. If negative, ondansetron is prescribed without ECG. Domperidone may also induce a prolonged QT interval. For domperidone, an ECG is only recommended when listed risk factors (hypokalemia/ poor renal function/ diabetes mellitus/ QT prolonging or comedication resulting in increased blood levels/ high doses/ pre‐existent prolonged QT time or long QT syndrome) are present. The same approach is considered acceptable to mitigate the risk of QT prolongation in ondansetron. Caution is needed in infants < 3 months old, as clinical monitoring of the drug effect is indicated.

Comparison with alternatives

Metoclopramide and domperidone are contraindicated due to the high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in infants. Hence, domperidone and metoclopramide are still considered to be unsuitable. Ondansetron is considered a safer alternative.

Conclusion on balance

The benefits only outweigh the risks when oral rehydration therapy alone is insufficient and the child is at risk of dehydration. Ondansetron should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms without (imminent) dehydration.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1136YQ6X]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 8 — For acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes not responding to outpatient abortive therapies in children and adolescents, the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) with a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects. Ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings and is considered probably effective, especially in those patients with lower-intensity attacks; decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety that can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and may also facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine that may facilitate sleep. Alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant. Background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a distressing and debilitating side effect of chemotherapeutic regimens that can profoundly affect quality of life. Different agents, including metoclopramide and corticosteroids, have been historically used to help patients control side effects but with limited efficacy. At present, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (RAs) are considered to be a central part of an effective prophylactic regimen against CINV. Combination regimens including 5-HT 3 RAs are currently recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

The 5-HT 3 RAs dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron are also indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); 5-HT 3 RAs are administered at the end of surgery conducted under total anesthesia. Indeed, the combination of a 5-HT 3 RA with dexamethasone and droperidol is sometimes used in high-risk PONV patients.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine, and sotalol) but also noncardiac medications from a variety of therapeutic classes, including 5-HT 3 RAs, have been associated with prolongation of cardiac repolarization as measured by the corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). These drugs have the potential to influence the I kr cardiac potassium channel, thereby resulting in increased repolarization time. To date, the primary clinical implication of repolarization changes is the increased risk of possible fatal cardiac events, i.e. torsades de pointes. Therefore, there is a regulatory mandate to define the potential of QTc interval prolongation induced by noncardiac drugs. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines, effective from November 2005, was developed to help drive adequate trials in healthy volunteers in order to ascertain the effects on QTc interval prolongation of new nonantiarrhythmic medications.

### Improving ondansetron use and oral rehydration instructions for pediatric acute gastroenteritis [^1144S6Gi]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Paediatric AGE represents a significant healthcare burden, including 1.5 million office visits, 200 000 hospitalisations and 300 deaths annually in the USA. Mild to moderate dehydration is a common sequelae optimally addressed through oral rehydration therapy. Ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3-serotonin antagonist, is effective at improving the success of oral rehydration and can be a safe and effective component of AGE therapy. It decreases vomiting, the need for intravenous fluid resuscitation, and hospitalisations for AGE. It has an excellent safety profile, with no attributed mortality, and only rare dysrhythmias in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, with no clinical examples since the 32 mg intravenous dosage was discontinued. In paediatric emergency department trials, intravenous ondansetron did not cause QTc prolongation on serial ECGs taken up to 1-hour postadministration. Given the extreme rarity of significant adverse events, joint guidelines published by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases encourage prescribing a short course of the medication. Previous studies conducted in emergency departments show improved outcomes in line with our aims of ondansetron use. Retrospective studies in paediatric patients with AGE found a decrease in return visits and shorter length of visitassociated with increased ondansetron use. A recent meta-analysis further supports the use of ondansetron in paediatric AGE, reinforcing ondansetron's benefits of decreasing use of intravenous rehydration, duration of nausea/emesis, and need for hospitalisation. Rutman et al implemented a clinical pathway emphasising oral rehydration and ondansetron for paediatric AGE and showed sustained decrease in intravenous fluid use and length of emergency room stay. Additionally, an economic analysis estimated an annual savings of US$65 000 000 in the USA based on routine administration of oral ondansetron to eligible paediatric patients with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting or dehydration.

5-HT3 receptor antagonists for vomiting prevention — An analysis found 10 out of 28 single drugs lowered the risk of vomiting, and three of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (RAs) included ramosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron. Tropisetron was ranked as one of the ten most clinically effective single drugs compared to placebo but had a lower certainty of evidence, while palonosetron was minimally effective with also a lower certainty of evidence. The recommended and high doses of granisetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron were similarly effective but more effective than lower doses of each agent; therefore, the use of recommended doses of these drugs should be adequate for vomiting prevention, though the 5-HT3 RA's class of drugs increased the risk of headache.

Droperidol — dosing and comparative effectiveness for antiemetic rescue are summarized as follows: Doses less than 1 mg have been found effective, and a dose of 0.625 mg was recommended by the panel. In a systematic review (SR) of antiemetic use after failed prophylaxis, droperidol 1–1.25 mg had equal efficacy as ondansetron 4–8 mg and both were better than propofol, and sedation occurred in 25% of patients who received droperidol.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114PmC1L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Most of the cases of QTc interval prolongation and related transient arrhythmias described in the literature have been observed in the PONV setting with either dolasetron or ondansetron. The addition of certain risk factors (e.g. congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, or female gender) have been suggested as potential inducers for torsades de pointes. The prescribing information for both dolasetron and ondansetron carries a cardiovascular warning. A more recent study in healthy volunteers, designed on the basis of the E14 guidance, found that under controlled conditions, both droperidol and ondansetron, either alone or in combination, induced marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drugs did not significantly increase QTc interval prolongation compared to droperidol alone.

Palonosetron is a unique 5-HT 3 RA that is characterized by a half-life of about 40 h compared to the first-generation 5-HT 3 RAs such as ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron (4–9 h). The present study investigated the effects of single increasing intravenous (IV) doses (0.25 mg, 0.75, and supratherapeutic 2.25 mg) of palonosetron on the ECG profile in healthy volunteers compared to placebo and a positive control, namely oral moxifloxacin (400 mg). The study was designed, conducted, analyzed, and interpreted in accordance with the recommendations of the ICH E14 Guidelines as a "thorough QT/QTc study".

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^111pt9Yu]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that ondansetron is beneficial to treat vomiting in the adult and adolescent acute care population and the first to specifically evaluate acute gastroenteritis. Treatment with an oral agent has the advantage of avoiding intravenous drug administration and fluid replacement. A bimodal release antiemetic tablet has the dual benefit of rapid onset of efficacy and prolonged duration of activity compared with currently available oral preparations. The sustained therapeutic action of bimodal release ondansetron contrasts with shorter acting preparations whose effect may wear off before another dose is taken, risking early recurrence of nausea or vomiting.

Compared with shorter acting preparations, time-release formulations have the advantages of dosing convenience, less fluctuation in blood levels, and better health outcomes across a number of disease states. Although not studied in gastroenteritis to our knowledge, simplification of dosing regimens and reduction in tablet burden with a once daily administration has been shown to improve adherence compared with conventional formulations with short half-lives that must be given 3 or more times per day. Among the potential disadvantages of a longer acting preparation is the reduced potential for dosage adjustment. In our study, metoclopramide was given to those who failed study treatment, and additional study would be needed to determine optimal rescue strategies for those who do not respond to bimodal release ondansetron.

### Implementing evidence based antiemetic guidelines in the oncology setting: results of a 4-month prospective intervention study [^1156aNHv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

There is a considerable gap between obtaining results in randomized trials and implementing them into practice. This is particularly relevant with the high-cost 5HT3 antiemetics, which include ondansetron, dolasetron and granisetron. Randomized trial data suggests that they should be used as a single daily dose during only the first 24 h of chemotherapy because they offer little benefit over less costly agents beyond this period. In this study, six intervention methods (i.e. multifaceted approach) were combined to change physicians' 5HT3 prescribing patterns to comply with evidence-based antiemetic guidelines. A six-step implementation process was adopted, consisting of guideline dissemination, the use of opinion leaders, interactive educational workshops, therapeutic reminders in the form of preprinted orders, clinical interventions by pharmacists for the event of inappropriate antiemetic orders, and physician audit and feedback. Once implemented, the control of emesis was collected in all patients who were enrolled in the intervention program. Multivariable regression analysis was then used to assess whether prescribing within antiemetic guidelines compromised patient care. A total of 195 inpatients were enrolled in the study over the 4-month intervention period. Overall, 88.7% of granisetron prescriptions fulfilled the guidelines with respect to appropriate indication, dosage, and duration of therapy. The multivariable analysis suggested that granisetron prescribing within guidelines did not compromise the control of acute and delayed emesis. In addition, patients who received evidence-based antiemetic therapy experienced a significant reduction in the severity of acute nausea [risk ratio (RR) = 0.69; P = 0.03]. The results of this guideline implementation study revealed that a pharmacist-driven multifaceted intervention program for such high-cost agents as 5HT3 antiemetics can promote their use in a clinically appropriate manner and can save unnecessary drug costs without compromising the quality of patient care.

IDENTIFIED BENEFITS AND RISKS

Benefits

Ondansetron improves success of oral rehydration therapy and prevents hospitalization. Appropriate dose selection is possible.

Risks

Infants up to 3 months of age have a greater risk for toxicity as exposure to ondansetron may be increased due to reduced clearance in this population. At the same time, when correcting based on reduced clearance only, these children are at risk for underexposure due to the higher Vd. Dose‐dependent prolongation of the QT interval may occur especially in children with congenital long QT interval syndrome. Prolongation of the QT interval is dose dependent. Use of ondansetron has a limited effect on cessation of vomiting.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^111AZTSp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Commonly used chemotherapy regimens, such as those containing anthracyclines, have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Since the adverse cardiac effects of some chemotherapeutic agents can emerge even years after treatment, cardiac toxicity of these agents is increasingly relevant because of the rising pool of long-term cancer survivors. The potential for adverse cardiac events should therefore be an important consideration when selecting an antiemetic agent to be administered as supportive care, so that there is no further increase in the potential risk of cardiac complications due to predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias or to cardiotoxic anticancer regimens.

In registrative pivotal trials of palonosetron in both HEC and MEC settings, ECGs were recorded for palonosetron and the comparators dolasetron and ondansetron in order to perform an integrated data analysis. In this analysis, the prolongation effect of palonosetron on QTc was of 2 ms while for ondansetron and dolasetron comparators, the mean changes from baseline were of a larger magnitude of 4–5 ms.

With respect to dolasetron (Anzemet, IV), a dose-dependent increase in QTc interval prolongation was shown in a thorough QT/QTc study, resulting in its CINV indication being removed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 22 September 2011). Post-marketing cases of torsades de pointes were also identified for ondansetron IV at the dose of 32 mg. A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in which a significant dose relationship with QTc interval prolongation was observed. For this reason, the FDA changed its recommended dose of ondansetron to half of the previously approved dose (a maximum of 16 mg for the IV formulation; 14 November 2014). Published data (ISoP 2011 and 2014) on palonosetron originating from post-marketing spontaneous reporting showed that the number of cardiac events associated with palonosetron was negligible and clinically irrelevant.

Palonosetron caused neither significant clinical prolongation of the QTc interval or adverse cardiac events in this study, indicating, based on ICH E14 guideline principles, that its risk of cardiotoxicity is low and that its use in the prevention of CINV in patients receiving MEC and HEC is apparently safe for cardiac function.

### Oral ondansetron administration to nondehydrated children with diarrhea and associated vomiting in emergency departments in Pakistan: a randomized controlled trial [^113Ymr8E]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Another key difference from previous studies relates to the frequency of vomiting. Our eligibility criteria required greater than or equal to 1 episode of vomiting during the 4 hours preceding triage. Although this criterion has previously been used, the frequency of vomiting in that study exceeded 9 episodes in the preceding 24 hours, whereas participants in our study reported just 4 episodes of vomiting in the preceding 24 hours. Although Roslund et aldid not specify a minimum frequency of vomiting episodes, study participants had a median of 10 episodes before presentation, with a median duration of vomiting of 1 day in the ondansetron group. Danewa et alrequired a minimum of 2 episodes of vomiting within the last 6 hours, and the cohort had a median of 6 episodes. Although our analysis stratified by frequency of vomiting did not reveal a significant difference between groups, the low number of vomiting episodes among participants preceding enrollment and the low proportion of control participants who vomited (24%) during the study, compared with results of previous studies (≈35%), may further explain the lack of beneficial effect identified.

As noted, intravenous rehydration use was lower in our study than we had anticipated. Although that may have been due to the aforementioned clinical features (ie, absence of dehydration and fewer vomiting episodes), ondansetron administration was not our only intervention. We also ensured that caregivers received education on the provision of oral rehydration solution, using appropriate oral rehydration therapy techniques, and they were provided with zinc therapy, as is recommended by WHO. These adjunctive therapies may have played a role in reducing the frequency of intravenous rehydration use.

Our findings highlight the adjunctive, and usually not indicated, use of additional therapies in this population. In addition to the administration of ondansetron to 50% of our study population (as per study protocol), 17% of study participants had received an antiemetic agent before ED arrival and an additional 36% were administered an antiemetic agent after enrollment (ie, outside of study protocol). In the ondansetron study arm, 43 children (14%) received a second dose of ondansetron while in the ED despite the responsible physician's being aware that they had a 50% chance of already having received a dose of ondansetron as part of the study protocol. Thus, there is a clear belief that ondansetron administration is beneficial when administered to children with mild disease.

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^111ryig8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vomiting resulting from acute gastroenteritis is commonly treated with intravenous antiemetics in acute care settings. If oral treatment were beneficial, patients might not need intravenous administered hydration or medication. Furthermore, a long-acting treatment could provide sustained relief from nausea and vomiting.

Objective

To determine whether an experimental long-acting bimodal release ondansetron tablet decreases gastroenteritis-related vomiting and eliminates the need for intravenous therapy for 24 hours after administration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial included patients from 19 emergency departments and 2 urgent care centers in the United States from December 8, 2014, to February 17, 2017. Patients 12 years and older with at least 2 vomiting episodes from presumed gastroenteritis in the previous 4 hours and symptoms with less than 36 hours' duration were randomized using a 3:2 active to placebo ratio. Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis and conducted from June 1, 2017, to November 1, 2017.

Intervention

Bimodal release ondansetron tablet containing 6 mg of immediate release ondansetron and 18 mg of a 24-hour release matrix for a total of 24 mg of ondansetron.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment success was defined as no further vomiting, no need for rescue medication, and no intravenous hydration for 24 hours after bimodal release ondansetron administration.

Results

Analysis included 321 patients (mean [SD] age, 29.0 [11.1] years; 195 [60.7%] women), with 192 patients in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 129 patients in the placebo group. Treatment successes were observed in 126 patients in the bimodal release ondansetron group (65.6%) compared with 70 patients in the placebo group (54.3%), with an 11.4% (95% CI, 0.3%-22.4%) absolute probability difference. The proportion of treatment success was 21% higher among patients who received bimodal release ondansetron compared with those who received a placebo (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00–1.46; p = 0.04). In an analysis including only patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and no major protocol violations, there were 123 treatment successes (69.5%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group compared with 67 treatment successes (54.9%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.53; p = 0.01). Adverse effects were infrequent and similar to the known safety profile of ondansetron.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that a long-acting bimodal release oral ondansetron tablet was an effective antiemetic among adolescents and adults with moderate to severe vomiting from acute gastroenteritis. The drug benefits extended to 24 hours after administration. Bimodal release ondansetron may decrease the need for intravenous access and emergency department care to manage acute gastroenteritis.

Outcomes

Primary Outcome

Percentage of patients needing nasogastric or intravenous rehydration after symptomatic oral treatment failure, defined as vomiting or fluid refusal after the second attempt of ORT.

Secondary Outcomes

1) Percentage of subjects needing hospital admission for the same illness;

2) Percentage of subjects needing observation stay for more than 6 hours for the same illness;

3) Total emesis duration in the 3 allocation groups;

4) Number of episodes of vomiting in the 3 treatment groups during the follow-up period;

5) Percentage of subjects presenting adverse events.

Data regarding the study outcomes will be collected by doctors on call or bedside nurse during the patient stay in the ED (or any other paediatric unit devoted to short observation) using a standardized assessment tool. Patient will be reassessed at 30 minute intervals for a minimum of 6 hours. During the patients' hospital stay, doctors and nurses will be blind to treatment assignment. A telephone follow up call will be made 48 hours after ED discharge using a standard form by a research assistant blind to treatment assignment.

Note: We discussed whether to consider hospital admission as the primary study outcome. Unfortunately, criteria for hospital admission could differ in different hospitals and ED settings and various administrative typologies of hospital admission exist in the study centres, including the "short observation" which may vary across centres in the way it is defined and applied. A recent systematic review on ondansetron confirms that when considering hospitalization as an outcome, there is great heterogeneity. Authors indicate different criteria for hospital admission as a possible explanation. Definition and standardization of hospital admission criteria are difficult due to differences in the administrative and organizational characteristics among participating EDs. Furthermore, nasogastric or intravenous rehydration represent a more objective outcome and represent anyway a good proxy measure of hospital admission.

Randomization

Patients will be randomly assigned in fixed block size of nine to receive ondansetron or domperidone or placebo. Randomisation list will be generated using STATA software and will be stratified according to participating centres. Randomization procedure will be centralized and managed by an independent statistician at the Coordinating Centre. The randomization sequence will be provided to the central pharmacy, which will prepare and dispense to participating hospitals active drugs and placebo. After checking eligibility and failure of first ORS administration, the next available bag containing drug preparations will be opened by the doctor on call or by the bedside nurse and a weigh-appropriate dose will be administered to patients. All study investigators, personnel, and participants will be unaware of the randomization procedure and pharmaceutical preparations assignments.

Ondansetron — Ondansetron was the first 5-HT3 RA on the market and commonly used as the preferred antiemetic for PONV prophylaxis; the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommended dose was 4 mg by slow IV injection or 16 mg of the oral formulation (oral disintegrating tablets, given 1 hour before induction). The IV drug has a mean elimination half-life of 3.1–5.8 hours in adults and is extensively metabolized by the liver, and CYP 2D6 ultrametabolizers are significantly more likely to develop PONV despite ondansetron prophylaxis. In a 2021 Cochrane network meta-analysis (NMA) on drugs for PONV prophylaxis in adults after general anesthesia, 585 randomized trials enrolling 97,516 patients were included to evaluate 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations, and ondansetron was the most investigated single drug followed by dexamethasone. Since the 2020 PONV Guideline, several studies have compared ondansetron 4 mg with dexamethasone 8 mg and concluded that ondansetron 4 mg is more effective for PONV prophylaxis; ondansetron 4 mg is comparable to prochlorperazine 10 mg for PONV prophylaxis, with a trend towards greater risk of side effects in the prochlorperazine group.

A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets and ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets has been unclear in many cases.

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting:

The adverse events in Table 5 have been reported in ≥ 5% of adult patients receiving a single 24-mg ondansetron tablet in 2 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin dose ≥ 50 mg/m2).

The adverse events in Table 6 have been reported in ≥ 5% of adults receiving either 8 mg of ondansetron tablets 2 or 3 times a day for 3 days or placebo in 4 trials. These patients were receiving concurrent moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens.

Table 6. Principal Adverse Events in US Trials: 3 Days of Therapy With 8-mg Ondansetron Tablets (Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy)

Central Nervous System:

There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron.

Hepatic:

In 723 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials, AST and/or ALT values have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of patients receiving ondansetron tablets. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes cannot be clearly determined.

There have been reports of liver failure and death in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear.

Integumentary:

Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.

Other:

Rare cases of anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina (chest pain), hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures have been reported. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron was unclear.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113J55HA]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition — antiemetic dosing and efficacy in CVS indicate that expert experience recommends ondansetron doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg with a usual upper limit of 20 mg/dose, with safe use of doses up to 32 mg reported in children; promethazine and prochlorperazine are described as ineffective compared with ondansetron (22% vs 58%, P < 0.05); when antiemetics fail, expert opinion recommends adding sedatives, with the most effective combination therapy being ondansetron and lorazepam, and an alternative of chlorpromazine and diphenhydramine that provides less antiemetic and more sedative effect.

### Granisetron vs ondansetron: is it a question of duration of 5-HT ₃ receptor blockade? [^112HZk1x]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Additionally, state that, 'there are no data to support the use of higher doses of the same 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists in patients failing the recommended dosage', citing. However, a dose-related response (P < 0.001) for oral dolasetron has been shown between doses of 25 and 200 mg (complete response rates 60.5 and 76.3% for 100 and 200 mg dolasetron, respectively;), despite a recommended dosage for the agent of 100 mg. Similar dose-related effects have also been reported with ondansetron. For example, a Phase I study comparing three doses of intravenous ondansetron t.d.s. (0.015, 0.15 and 0.3 mg kg −1) indicated a trend towards increased efficacy with higher doses (complete response rates were 15, 46 and 58% respectively), though only the 0.015 mg kg −1 dose was shown to be significantly different from the other dose levels. Further studies have reported significantly superior efficacy with a single dose on ondansetron, 32 mg, compared with a single 8 mg dose. Moreover, studies comparing granisetron, 40 and 160 μg kg −1, show a trend towards increased efficacy at the higher dose; 24 h after administration of chemotherapeutic agents, 81% of granisetron, 160 mcg kg −1, were emesis-free compared with 75% receiving granisetron 40 μg kg −1. In addition, patients refractory to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists have been shown to respond well to granisetron, at doses that are higher than generally used, in subsequent chemotherapy cycles.

In conclusion, the effective 'switch' to granisetron in this study may, therefore, be due to a number of factors, but is likely to be attributable primarily to the longer duration of action of granisetron compared with ondansetron rather than the lack of cross resistance between 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists.

Results

Literature search

After screening 7,608 citations, we reviewed 1,014 potentially relevant full-text articles and identified 115 primary publications and five companion reports (reporting on six studies) providing data on 27,787 patients that met our inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Overall, 77 studies were excluded because they reported results suspected or confirmed to be fraudulent. One of the included studies was an unpublished conference abstract.

Randomization and Study Procedures

A computer-generated allocation sequence was used for randomization, and a central call-in center directed stratification by age (< 18 vs ≥ 18 years). The study drug was administered in a 3:2 active to placebo ratio. The experimental drug or a like-appearing placebo tablet was sealed in a box identified only by an assigned study number. After obtaining consent, the on-site clinical investigator contacted the central randomization call-in center and was directed to use the numbered sealed box corresponding to the randomized allocation. No information regarding the contents of the numbered sealed box was provided to the study investigator.

The allocated study tablet was administered before any ED intervention. If the tablet was vomited within 15 minutes of administration, another tablet was given. If vomiting first occurred between 15 and 30 minutes after administration of the first tablet, another tablet was not given and the patient was permitted to continue the study.

Oral ingestion of fluids was encouraged during the ED stay to treat dehydration according to clinical status and the patient's ability to tolerate oral hydration. Additional testing, including imaging or laboratory tests, could be performed any time at the discretion of the treating clinician. Intravenous preparations of other medications, such as antibiotics, were permitted as long as the infusion volume was less than 100 mL. At 4 hours after study drug ingestion, the patient was assessed for discharge, although the duration of ED treatment could exceed 4 hours if needed. Patients who were ED treatment successes were discharged with 3 additional study tablets to take 1 every 24 hours as needed for up to 3 days.

Antipyretic, antidiarrheal, proton pump inhibitor, and antacid medications were permitted at any point during the study. For patients whose treatment failed, metoclopramide was the suggested default rescue medication. Ondansetron and any other 5-HT3 antagonist were not permitted for at least 24 hours after study drug administration.

At discharge, patients were given diary cards to record any episodes of vomiting, bowel movements, and severity of nausea, as well as other symptoms of gastroenteritis, adverse events, and any medications taken, whether for gastroenteritis or other indications. Patients were contacted daily by telephone to retrieve the relevant information.

Primary End Point Definition

The primary end point was treatment success, defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria from 30 minutes through 24 hours after the first dose of study medication: (1) without further vomiting, (2) without rescue medication for nausea or vomiting, and (3) no intravenous hydration.

### Ondansetron to reduce neonatal opioid withdrawal severity a randomized clinical trial [^115q6Nfk]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine if treatment with a 5-HT3 antagonist (ondansetron) reduces need for opioid therapy in infants at risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).

Study Design

A multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial of ninety (90) infants. The intervention arms were intravenous ondansetron or placebo during labor followed by a daily dose of ondansetron or placebo in infants for five days.

Results

Twenty-two (49%) ondansetron-treated and 26 (63%) placebo-treated infants required pharmacologic treatment (p > 0.05). The Finnegan score was lower in the ondansetron-treated group (4.6 vs. 5.6, p = 0.02). A non-significant trend was noted for the duration of hospitalization. There was no difference in need for phenobarbital or clonidine therapy, or total dose of morphine in the first 15 days of NOWS treatment.

Conclusions

Ondansetron treatment reduced the severity of NOWS symptoms; and there was an indication that it could reduce the length of stay.

Clinical Trial Registration

2 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and/or Vomiting 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2. 1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Initial and Repeat Courses of Emetogenic Chemotherapy. Ondansetron Injection is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended for patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients in whom nausea and/or vomiting must be avoided postoperatively, Ondansetron Injection is recommended even when the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low. For patients who do not receive prophylactic Ondansetron Injection and experience nausea and/or vomiting postoperatively, Ondansetron Injection may be given to prevent further episodes.

Dosage and Administration The recommended dosage for adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy is 0. 15-mg/kg per dose for 3 doses. Caution: Dilution of Ondansetron Injection is required in adult and pediatric patients prior to administration. Infuse intravenously over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the start of emetogenic chemotherapy and then repeat 4 and 8 hours after the first dose.

### A randomised trial of ondansetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea [^112Fsp2d]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Our variable dosing regime mirrored clinical practice and we feel gives a better idea of how the drug will perform in clinical practice. It undoubtedly improved response rate and had we chosen a fixed dose many patients would have developed constipation and probably dropped out or had worsening symptoms. As expected, the median number of tablets per day was much lower for ondansetron than placebo, median (IQR) 1 (0.5–1.4) and 2 (1–5), respectively. However, dose titration does complicate analysis since only the stool diaries in the last 2 weeks are truly informative of the response, meaning that we cannot impute data to allow for incomplete diaries, which would be normal practice. These incomplete data led to only 98 subjects being analysed.

Our evaluation time of just 2 weeks was short but in patients with diarrhoea and rapid transit, drug effects tend to be rapid and quickly reversible, for example with loperamide. We found that most subjects returned to their previous bowel habit within the 2-week washout and only 17 patients required longer.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron tablets 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron tablets for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, was confirmed.

Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the US in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron tablets was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron tablets twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron tablets were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

Research agenda for PONV — Future priorities include refinement of risk assessment given wide inter-individual variability in PONV; genome-wide association studies have identified several candidate SNPs in Caucasian and East Asian populations; inflammation may contribute to risk, with early research suggesting that elevated preoperative peripheral blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios may be markers for individual risk; historically, modern approaches started with generic ondansetron, making risk identification actionable with an effective, safe and cost-accessible antiemetic, yet further improvement is still needed in both knowledge and practice.

### The effect of intravenous ondansetron on QT interval in the emergency department [^115PRXBM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ondansetron, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is commonly used in emergency departments to treat nausea and vomiting. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that this medicine may cause QT prolongation, potentially leading to deadly arrhythmias. The objective of this study was to characterize the QT interval prolongation associated with ondansetron use in the Emergency Department.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who presented to the emergency department during a one-year period and were treated with intravenous ondansetron. We investigated the QT prolongation associated with dosages. ECGs were obtained before the medication and 5, 15, and 30 minutes after IV drug administration. Every QT measurement was recorded and compared to the zero point. The severity of drug-induced QT prolongation was determined according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Compliance (ICH). QTc prolongation was categorized as 'negligible' (< 5 ms), 'significant' (> 20 ms), 'potential concern' (> 30 ms), or 'definitely worrying' (> 60 ms).

Results

Of the 435 patients enrolled in the study, 60% (261 patients) were female and the mean age was 39 (± 18). The QT prolongation peaked at the fifth minute and remained consistent at the fifteenth and thirty-first minutes. The maximum prolongation of the mean QT duration occured at the fifth minute (7.9 ± 18.1 ms). No patient revealed any problems with cardiac conduction. The prolonged QT interval was not related to the dose of ondansetron, but QT measurements were higher in the 30th minute in patients treated with 8 mg of ondansetron. The effect of ondansetron administration on QT prolongation was found to be above the 'negligible' but below the 'significant' value, according to the ICH recommendations.

Discussion

In this study, QT prolongation due to ondansetron administration was below the 'important' value according to the recommendations of the ICH. No cases of cardiac arrhythmia were reported in any of the partients. Thus, routine ECG monitoring in patients given ondansetron due to the risk of QTc prolongation does not seem cost-effective when evaluated together with additional factors such as its negative impact on emergency patient flow, waste of personnel and time, and increase in healthcare costs. In the absence of a known risk of cardiac arrhythmia, IV administration of 4 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron doses no risk of QT prolongation in the emergency population.

4.3 Recommendation 8. We conditionally recommend aprepitant to abort symptoms of a CVS episode

Grade: Conditional recommendation, very low‐quality evidence. Vote: > 80% agreement

There is a single open‐label trial of oral aprepitant used as abortive treatment of CVS in children and adolescents who were refractory to conventional treatment. 43 All children > 20 kg were given the standard regimen used in chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) of 125 mg initially during the prodrome, then 80 mg daily for the following 2 days as needed. Oral aprepitant could be retained if administered during a prodrome at least 30 minutes before the onset of vomiting. At the end of 12 months, this recurring abortive regimen significantly reduced the duration of episodes from 5 days to 1 day, the number of vomits from 9 to 4 times per hour, and the number of hospital admissions from 9 to 2.5. Side effects appear to be mild, and the medication was well tolerated. There are no data on the use of intravenous fosaprepitant (phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant) in CVS, although it has been used effectively in moderate and highly emetogenic CINV. 74

Based upon low‐quality evidence in children and adolescents and positive clinical experience, the committee recommends aprepitant as a potentially effective second‐line abortive agent. We recommend using a standard dosing regimen of 125 mg, 80 mg, and 80 mg on three consecutive days with the first dose to be taken as early in the prodrome and before the onset of vomiting. The target individuals in whom abortive aprepitant is recommended include those who are refractory to standard abortive therapy (eg, sumatriptan and ondansetron) and those who have a defined prodrome or a predictable periodicity (episode which occurs in relation to the menstrual cycle) in which aprepitant can be initiated a day or two before the anticipated onset of vomiting. Difficulties with obtaining insurance approval for aprepitant and IV fosaprepitant have been a barrier to its use despite demonstrated efficacy.

Conclusions

Numerous therapeutic options for prevention and treatment of CINV are now available, and many of the alternatives in each class of agents are very similar to each other with regard to efficacy and safety. It is important that clinicians employ optimal CINV prophylaxis right from the start based on current guidelines and clinical trial data to improve patient QoL and prevent chemotherapy delays and discontinuations. The ultimate goal is complete control of all aspects of CINV, including both nausea and vomiting. This will require further evaluation of optimal dosing, timing of administration, and effective combination strategies.

### ONDANSETRON-ondansetron tablet, orally disintegrating… [^1135jYwq]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy‑induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction. Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. Prevention of Chemotherapy‑Induced Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24-mg dose of ondansetron orally in 2 trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy were: headache and diarrhea. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4, the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs. In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase systemic concentrations of high-dose methotrexate. Risk Summary. The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron have been established in pediatric patients 4 years and older for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.

Use of ondansetron in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ondansetron in adults with additional data from 3 open-label, uncontrolled, non-US trials in 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the apparent volume of distribution is increased, resulting in a significant increase in the half-life of ondansetron. Therefore, do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, was confirmed.

Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) treatment comparisons — Dose adjustments may not be needed when treating breakthrough PONV with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists above the doses used for prophylaxis. Newer 5-HT3 agents did not show improved efficacy over ondansetron (A3, moderate certainty). Droperidol 1 to 1.25 mg has comparable efficacy as ondansetron at the recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg (A3, low certainty). Droperidol was found to be more effective than dexamethasone 8 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg (A3, low certainty). Metoclopramide 10 mg is significantly less effective than ondansetron and droperidol (A2, moderate certainty). Propofol 20–40 mg is effective as treatment for PONV (A3, low certainty).

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — use of 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists for acute episodes: The guideline panel suggests using 5‑hydroxytryptamine 3 (5‑HT3) receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and an individualized CVS Action Plan to guide stepwise acute and preventive care may improve outcomes.

### Consensus recommendations for the prevention of vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112DPBwz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In this update of our 2005 document, we used an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents for the prevention of emesis and nausea following anticancer chemotherapies of high emetic risk. A three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant beginning before chemotherapy and continuing for up to 4 days remains the standard of care. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. We conclude that, for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. In trials designed to prove the equivalence of palonosetron to ondansetron and granisetron, palonosetron proved superior in emesis prevention, while adverse effects were comparable. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) rescue after failed prophylaxis — The more important findings of the review were from trials where prophylaxis was given but failed. For patients failing ondansetron prophylaxis, redosing with ondansetron or other 5-HT3 antagonists did not provide further benefits (A3, low certainty). Promethazine 6.25 mg and higher shows to be more effective in patients who failed ondansetron prophylaxis over the redosing of ondansetron (B1, low certainty). For promethazine, there is not an apparent dose response in the range of 6.25–25 mg, hence the lowest dose is recommended. The higher doses of promethazine in this range have been associated with sedation.

Intravenous 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for acute cyclic vomiting syndrome — Recommendation 8 and supporting remarks indicate that the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects); the panel noted that ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings, is considered probably effective especially in those with lower-intensity attacks though part of its apparent efficacy may result from treatment bias or placebo effect, and decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety which can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant oral anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine; alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant; background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

Palonosetron — 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (RA) for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — has a recommended dose of 0.075 mg administered over 10 seconds and an elimination half-life of 40 hours. Using a weight-based dosing strategy, 1mcg/kg palonosetron was more effective than ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg, and it has been suggested that the standardized dose of palonosetron 0.075 mg may lead to pharmacological underdosing in obese patients, with weight-based dosing adjustment more efficacious without an increase in side effects. Palonosetron 0.075 mg was found to be more effective than ondansetron 4 mg in both abdominal and renal transplant surgery patients, and patients who received subsequent redosing of ondansetron 8 mg had comparable PONV risk as those who received a single dose palonosetron, although more headaches were noted in the ondansetron arm (26% vs 8%). Overall, palonosetron appears to be more effective when compared to ondansetron 4 mg or 8 mg; however, when added doses of ondansetron are given, no differences were found between the two drugs (A3).

Breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) — olanzapine studies: A randomized study compared olanzapine (10 mg once daily) plus ondansetron with palonosetron, and with ondansetron alone for the treatment of breakthrough CINV in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and olanzapine plus ondansetron was superior to ondansetron alone and to palonosetron. A single-arm, prospective trial in 19 patients assessed total control and early efficacy using nausea scores at 30, 60, and 120 min after taking olanzapine (5 mg daily for 3 days); nausea was significantly reduced after 30 min (p = 0.0078) and the scale had been reduced by 67% after 60 min, but olanzapine 5 mg did not show the expected effect on the complete disappearance of CINV within 24 h. A well-conducted meta-analysis identified randomized controlled trials comparing olanzapine to other standard antiemetics; in the breakthrough setting, olanzapine was statistically and clinically superior in the "no emesis" endpoint analyzed, and given the possible reduction in side effects, a 5-mg dose of olanzapine could be considered, with additional research required to establish the optimum dose.

Abortive interventions (pharmacological) — The guideline panel recommends using antimigraine agents (e.g. NSAIDs, triptans) for treatment of acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes in children and adolescents with a personal or family history of migraine (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests using NK1-receptor antagonist (i.e., aprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and acute treatment with NK1 receptor antagonist should be continued for 3 consecutive days. The guideline panel suggests using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (i.e., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Methotrexate-induced nausea in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114yGpaU]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Ondansetron has also been shown to be effective in treating MTX-induced nausea in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In an observational study, 9 adults with rheumatoid arthritis were given ondansetron because they had severe nausea that persisted despite receipt of the anti-emetic metoclopramide and switching MTX from oral to intramuscular administration. Following initiation of ondansetron, the intensity and duration of nausea declined dramatically in all patients, and this improvement continued throughout the 24 weeks of follow-up.

Some pediatric rheumatologists are using ondansetron in clinical practice. Among the 84 respondents to the UK provider survey, 21% always or often (> 50% of the time) start an anti-emetic concurrently when starting MTX for the first time. When prescribing an anti-emetic, ondansetron was the first choice for 88% of respondents.

Dosing recommendations for the use of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic medications are provided by the manufacturer. For children ages 4 to 11 years, the recommended dose is 4 mg orally given 30 min prior to emetogenic medication. For children age 12 years or older, the recommended dose is 8 mg orally given 30 min prior to emetogenic medication. Patients may take 1–2 additional doses of ondansetron every 8 h as needed for post-MTX nausea and vomiting.

Behavioral interventions for MTX-induced anticipatory nausea

Behavioral interventions may help increase tolerance to MTX and reduce the occurrence of associative and anticipatory nausea. In a retrospective chart review of children with JIA, investigators reported outcomes for 10 patients who were referred to a pediatric psychologist for behavioral therapy for anticipatory nausea (N = 6) and anxiety (N = 9) related to MTX. Behavioral therapy was adapted to age. Children less than 10 years old received the "Magic Box" method based on systemic desensitization by distraction, and older children received cognitive behavioral therapy. The behavioral therapy intervention was found to be fully effective in 5 children (50%), moderately effective in 2 children (20%), and not effective in 3 children (30%).

### 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists for prevention of late acute-onset emesis [^114ksBEw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the currently available literature on the efficacy of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists in the prevention of late acute-onset chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (12–24 h after cytotoxic treatment).

Data Sources

Primary articles were identified by PubMed search (performed in March 2004) and through secondary sources. Search terms included granisetron, ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, acute, chemotherapy, nausea, and vomiting (a further search was performed for palonosetron in March 2004).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that performed regular assessments (every 2–6 h) of antiemetic control over the first 24 hours with 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Current guidelines recommend the use of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting but do not differentiate between the available agents. However, there is variability in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents, and this has implications for dosing regimen, safety, efficacy, and potential drug-drug interactions. Cytotoxic agents vary in the time profile of their emetic effect; this must be considered when choosing an appropriate 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. The optimal agent should be simple to administer and provide safe and effective antiemetic protection over the whole 24-hour period.

Conclusions

The differences between the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists have important consequences for their dosing and efficacy in the control of late acute-onset chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
