## Question

Reasons for elevated anion gap

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the reasons for an elevated anion gap. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and pathophysiology of the anion gap and why it increases. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies using a reliable framework and verify the completeness of the differential. Next, I will examine special contexts and confounders that can mask or mimic an elevated gap. After that, I should integrate the anion gap with the osmolal gap and delta gap to refine diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized approach to evaluation and management, ensuring I double-check areas where the anion gap can be misleading or artifactual.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. The serum anion gap is calculated as sodium minus the sum of chloride and bicarbonate, and it primarily reflects unmeasured anions such as albumin and, when elevated, organic acids; an increased gap signals accumulation of unmeasured anions from endogenous or exogenous sources, whereas a normal gap implies chloride replaces bicarbonate during acidosis, yielding hyperchloremia rather than unmeasured anion accumulation [^115oS1GG] [^112mhVzE] [^1117qBur].

> Hold on, I should verify the normal range and the need for albumin correction before listing causes. The typical reference range is about 8–12 mEq/L, but interindividual variability and assay differences are substantial, and hypoalbuminemia lowers the baseline gap; therefore, I need to correct the anion gap for albumin, commonly by adding 2.5 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL drop below 4.0 g/dL, to avoid underestimating the true gap in critically ill or cirrhotic patients [^115oS1GG] [^1172rQYh] [^113q513U].

> Next, I will categorize the causes using a practical framework, but wait, let me ensure I'm not missing rare entities. The GOLD MARK mnemonic is more inclusive than MUDPILES and covers the major categories: glycols (ethylene glycol, propylene glycol), oxoproline (pyroglutamic acidosis), L-lactate, D-lactate, renal failure, ketoacidosis, aspirin/salicylates, and other toxins or medications; this helps me remember both common and uncommon etiologies in a clinically coherent way [^117BjM5E].

> I will now examine endogenous organic acidosis, starting with lactic acidosis, but I should double-check the type A versus type B distinction. Type A lactic acidosis arises from tissue hypoxia due to shock, sepsis, severe anemia, or carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning, whereas type B reflects impaired clearance or overproduction without hypoxia, including liver disease, thiamine deficiency, malignancy, and mitochondrial dysfunction; metformin-associated lactic acidosis is rare but important, typically in the setting of renal or hepatic dysfunction or hypoperfusion, and mandates immediate drug cessation and supportive care including hemodialysis when indicated [^113kkZht] [^116q9XRK] [^112gciiT].

> Let me consider ketoacidosis next, and I should confirm the classic triad. Diabetic ketoacidosis presents with hyperglycemia, ketonemia or ketonuria, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis; alcoholic ketoacidosis often occurs after prolonged heavy drinking with poor intake and can feature normal or low glucose with high beta-hydroxybutyrate; starvation ketoacidosis is seen with prolonged caloric deprivation and can be mistaken for DKA, so I need to check the clinical context and glucose level carefully [^111itEwi] [^115qd9am] [^112eje5K].

> Now, I should review toxic alcohols and their temporal patterns, and I need to ensure I don't misinterpret a normal early gap as exclusion. Ethylene glycol and methanol initially raise the osmolal gap due to parent compounds, then later produce an anion gap acidosis as toxic metabolites accumulate; isopropanol elevates the osmolal gap but does not cause an anion gap acidosis; propylene glycol, a common medication solvent, can cause lactic acidosis and an elevated anion gap, particularly with high-dose infusions in renal impairment; the "double gap" (elevated anion and osmolal gaps) is a clue but can be mimicked by alcoholic ketoacidosis, so I should correlate with history, ketones, and, when available, specific assays [^111QBddX] [^115BQ8FH] [^115MCQyK] [^116EZaUT].

> But wait, what if the patient has renal failure without an obvious toxin or lactate source? I should confirm the role of retained acids. In advanced CKD, impaired excretion of phosphate, sulfate, and other organic acids can produce a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, though the gap may be only modestly elevated; this is distinct from early CKD, which more often manifests a non–anion gap acidosis, so I need to check the stage of kidney disease and the magnitude of the gap [^1128dyGX].

> I need to check for salicylate poisoning and its laboratory artifacts, because missing this can be dangerous. Severe salicylate toxicity classically causes a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but high salicylate levels can artifactually elevate chloride on some ion-selective electrodes, yielding pseudohyperchloremia and a falsely normal or even negative anion gap; thus, a normal gap does not exclude salicylates in the right clinical context, and I should request a salicylate level and consider the chloride-to-sodium ratio or alternative chloride measurement methods if suspicious [^112V6Cur] [^115SkVty] [^111FjRKB].

> Let me not forget pyroglutamic acidosis, and I should verify the risk factors. Chronic acetaminophen use, especially in malnourished patients or those with renal or hepatic dysfunction, can cause accumulation of 5-oxoproline and a high anion gap acidosis; diagnosis is supported by urine organic acids when available, and management includes stopping acetaminophen and providing N-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione, with supportive care as needed [^117BjM5E] [^111sbUtx] [^113YJCvu].

> Next, I should review D-lactic acidosis, and I need to ensure I consider short bowel or malabsorption syndromes. Overgrowth of D-lactate–producing bacteria in the colon after carbohydrate loads can cause episodic encephalopathy and high anion gap acidosis; this is a classic cause of unexplained anion gap elevation in patients with prior bowel surgery or blind loops, so I should ask about gastrointestinal history and recent carbohydrate intake [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of the delta gap and delta bicarbonate to detect mixed disorders. In a pure high anion gap acidosis, the rise in anion gap should roughly match the fall in bicarbonate. A delta gap to delta bicarbonate ratio near 1 supports a simple process, a ratio less than 1 suggests a concurrent non–anion gap acidosis, and a ratio greater than 1 suggests a superimposed metabolic alkalosis. However, I must remember that this 1:1 relationship is imperfect and should be interpreted alongside the full clinical picture [^115oS1GG] [^112agy4M] [^112tEJd9].

> I should double-check the osmolal gap and its limitations so I don't overcall toxic alcohols. The osmolal gap is the difference between measured and calculated serum osmolality; an elevated gap supports the presence of unmeasured osmoles such as toxic alcohols, but it can also be elevated in alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal failure, and other states, and a normal gap does not exclude toxic alcohol ingestion, particularly early or late in the course; therefore, I should integrate the anion gap, osmolal gap, history, and ketone measurements rather than relying on any single surrogate marker [^111QBddX] [^116EZaUT] [^117Ld7qW].

> Let me consider special contexts that can confound interpretation, and I need to ensure I adjust for albumin and recognize spurious results. Hypoalbuminemia lowers the baseline anion gap and can mask a true increase, so albumin correction is essential; conversely, paraproteinemias or bromide intoxication can lower the calculated gap or cause a negative gap, and salicylate interference can artifactually raise chloride and lower the gap; in all such cases, I should verify with repeat testing, alternative analyzers, or direct measurements before concluding the gap is truly normal [^115oS1GG] [^1172rQYh] [^11362PDQ] [^115SkVty].

> I will now synthesize a practical diagnostic approach, but let me first confirm the initial steps. Calculate the anion gap, correct for albumin, review the history for diabetes, alcohol use, medications including metformin and acetaminophen, and potential ingestions; obtain lactate, ketones, renal function, and consider an osmolal gap; if the osmolal gap is elevated with a high anion gap, prioritize toxic alcohols and treat empirically with fomepizole while awaiting levels; if the anion gap remains unexplained, consider pyroglutamic acidosis and D-lactic acidosis based on risk factors and test accordingly [^115oS1GG] [^111QBddX] [^115BQ8FH].

> Finally, I should review management principles succinctly and make sure I align them with causation. Treat the underlying cause, provide supportive care, and avoid reflexive bicarbonate unless there are specific indications. For DKA, use insulin, fluids, and electrolytes. For toxic alcohols, give fomepizole or ethanol and arrange hemodialysis. For metformin-associated lactic acidosis, stop metformin and dialyze when indicated. For pyroglutamic acidosis, stop acetaminophen and give N-acetylcysteine. And throughout, correct hypokalemia and other electrolytes as needed while monitoring for complications of acidosis and its therapy [^1117qBur] [^111itEwi] [^115BQ8FH] [^116q9XRK] [^117BjM5E].

---

The anion gap rises when unmeasured anions accumulate in plasma, most often from **lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis (DKA/AKA), renal failure, or toxic ingestions** (ethylene glycol, methanol, salicylates) [^1164Bq47] [^1117qBur]. Additional causes include propylene glycol, acetaminophen-related pyroglutamic acidosis, and D-lactic acidosis; **hypoalbuminemia can lower the baseline gap and mask a true increase**, so **albumin correction is essential** [^1164Bq47] [^114J8xrK] [^1172rQYh]. An elevated anion gap with low bicarbonate and appropriate respiratory compensation indicates a high anion gap metabolic acidosis [^1117qBur]; the delta gap helps detect mixed disorders [^115oS1GG] [^112agy4M].

---

## Pathophysiology of the anion gap

The anion gap reflects the difference between measured cations (Na+) and measured anions (Cl-, HCO3-), representing unmeasured anions (e.g. albumin, phosphate, sulfates, organic acids) [^112mhVzE]. Normal is ~8–12 mEq/L, largely due to albumin; **hypoalbuminemia lowers the baseline gap**, so **correction is needed** [^115oS1GG] [^1172rQYh].

## Common causes of elevated anion gap

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Lactic acidosis | - Sepsis <br/> - Shock <br/> - Hypoxia <br/> - Metformin (rare) | - Overproduction or underutilization of lactate [^113kkZht] <br/> - Impaired oxidative metabolism [^113uTM3c] |
| Ketoacidosis | - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) <br/> - Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) <br/> - Starvation ketoacidosis | - Accumulation of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) [^111itEwi] <br/> - Organic acids [^115qd9am] |
| Renal failure | - Acute kidney injury <br/> - Chronic kidney disease | Retained organic and inorganic acids (phosphates, sulfates, urates) [^115RbJd4] |
| Toxic ingestions | - Ethylene glycol <br/> - Methanol <br/> - Salicylates <br/> - Propylene glycol | - Metabolism to organic acids (oxalate, formate, lactate) [^116FVrMP] [^116sTKRu] [^115MCQyK] |
| Pyroglutamic acidosis | Chronic acetaminophen use (especially with malnutrition) | Accumulation of 5-oxoproline due to glutathione depletion [^111sbUtx] [^1111SCVD] |
| D-lactic acidosis | Short bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth | Accumulation of D-lactate from bacterial fermentation [^notfound] |

## Less common causes

Less common causes include **multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency** (a mitochondrial disorder causing organic acid accumulation) [^115tfgb6] and **toluene poisoning** (initially high anion gap, later normal anion gap due to metabolites) [^111Prjk7].

---

## Clinical significance

An elevated anion gap indicates **accumulation of unmeasured anions**, most often from lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, or toxic ingestions [^113JDFth]. It is a key marker of high anion gap metabolic acidosis and guides further evaluation and management [^115oS1GG].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat AG to exclude lab error [^notfound].
- **Identify cause**: Measure lactate, ketones, renal function, and toxicology screen [^114iHNUk].
- **Albumin correction**: Adjust AG for hypoalbuminemia [^1172rQYh].
- **Delta gap**: Compare ΔAG to ΔHCO3- to detect mixed disorders [^112agy4M].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management targets the **underlying cause** (e.g. fluids/insulin for DKA, dialysis for toxins/renal failure, NAC for pyroglutamic acidosis) while providing supportive care and correcting electrolytes [^111itEwi] [^115BXWUQ] [^1111SCVD]. Prompt recognition and treatment are critical to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^117NvMU7].

---

The anion gap rises when unmeasured anions accumulate, most often from **lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, or toxic ingestions**; **correcting for albumin and using the delta gap** help ensure accurate interpretation and guide therapy [^115oS1GG] [^112agy4M].

### Adolescent presents with altered mental status and elevated anion gap after suicide attempt by ethylene glycol ingestion [^1153HEJp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 16-year-old healthy adolescent male who presented to the local emergency department with altered mental status. En route to a tertiary care facility, he began to decompensate and was found to be markedly acidotic. Further investigation revealed an elevated anion gap, and physical examination showed only abdominal pain and decreased level of consciousness. A broad differential diagnosis was considered at the time of the patient's presentation at the tertiary care center including ingestion of a volatile alcohol, sepsis, and an abdominal catastrophe. Although fomepizole and emergent dialysis were being initiated, laboratory tests confirmed ethylene glycol poisoning. This case demonstrates the importance of early recognition of potential ingestions in patients with altered mental status and supportive laboratory findings.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Two gaps too many, three clues too few? Do elevated osmolal and anion gaps with crystalluria always mean ethylene glycol poisoning? [^116FVrMP]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old African-American man with a medical history significant for heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, delirium tremens, nephrolithiasis and seizure disorder was brought to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with significantly elevated lactate along with an elevated osmolal gap and calcium oxalate crystals in his urine. With this combination of findings, ethylene glycol poisoning was high in the differential. This case report describes why ethylene glycol poisoning was not the diagnosis in this patient despite the presence of these three classic laboratory findings, therefore emphasising the fact that these findings should not be taken at face value because they can be seen collectively in a patient yet each have a different cause.

### Elevated osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis [^116EZaUT]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of the osmol gap as a surrogate marker of toxic alcohol poisoning is common. Unfortunately, many patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis have elevated osmol gaps and are misdiagnosed with toxic alcohol poisoning. We aimed to characterize the range of osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Methods

This was a retrospective poison center study. Data from 24years were reviewed using the following case definition of alcoholic ketoacidosis: (1) documented alcohol use disorder; (2) presence of urine or serum ketones or an elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration; (3) an anion gap ≥ 14mmol/L. Potential cases of alcoholic ketoacidosis that failed to fulfill all three criteria were adjudicated by three toxicologists. Exclusion criteria included (1) detectable toxic alcohol concentration, (2) hemodialysis and/or multiple doses of fomepizole, (3) no osmol gap documented, (4) other diagnoses that lead to a metabolic acidosis. Demographics, pH, anion gap, lactate concentration, and osmol gap were extracted.

Results

Of 1,493 patients screened, 55 met criteria for alcoholic ketoacidosis. Sixty-four percent were male, and their median age was 52years. The median osmol gap was 27 [IQR 18–36]. The largest anion gap was 57mmol/L, and the lowest pH was 6.8. Forty-five (82%) of the patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis had osmol gaps > 10; 38 (69%) had osmol gaps > 20; 24 (44%) had osmol gaps > 30; 11 (20%) had osmol gaps > 40.

Discussion

The large range of osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis often reaches values associated with toxic alcohol poisoning. The study is limited by the potential for transcribing errors and the inability to identify the cause of the osmol gap.

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis had a median osmol gap of 27. Given that alcoholic ketoacidosis is easily and inexpensively treated, proper identification may prevent costly and invasive treatment directed at toxic alcohol poisoning.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^112DZbAE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

### The value of the chloride: sodium ratio in differentiating the aetiology of metabolic acidosis [^111XQGEz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Stewart's physicochemical approach to acid-base balance defines the aetiology of a metabolic acidosis by quantifying anions of tissue acids (TA), which consist of unmeasured anions (UMA) and/or lactate. We hypothesised that an increase in TA during metabolic acidosis would lead to a compensatory fall in the plasma chloride (Cl) relative to sodium (Cl:Na ratio) in order to preserve electro-neutrality. Thus, the Cl:Na ratio could be used as a simple alternative to the anion gap in identifying raised TA.

Patients

Two hundred and eighty two consecutive patients who were admitted to our Paediatric Intensive Care were enrolled in the study.

Interventions

We obtained 540 samples (admission n = 282, 24 h n = 258) for analysis of blood chemistry, lactate and quantification of TA and UMA. Samples were subgrouped into those with metabolic acidosis (standard bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l) either with or without increased UMA (> 3 mEq/l).

Measurements and Results

Metabolic acidosis occurred in 46% of samples, of which 52.3% (120/230) had increased UMA. The dominant component of TA was UMA rather than lactate, and these two components did not always rise in tandem. Our hypothesis of relative hypochloraemia was supported by a lower Cl:Na ratio (P < 0.0001) but not a lower absolute Cl (P = 0.5) in the acidotic subgroup with raised UMA, and by the inverse relationship between TA and the Cl:Na ratio. (coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.37, P < 0.0001). The best discriminator for the presence of raised TA was the albumin-corrected anion gap (AGcorr), however, this could not track changes in TA with clinical accuracy. The Cl:Na ratio discriminated reasonably well, a ratio of < 0.75 identified TA (positive predictive value (PPV) 88%) with a likelihood ratio (LR) similar to the AG (7.8 vs7.4). Conversely, a high ratio (> 0.79) excluded TA (PPV 81%, LR 4.5). Base deficit (BD) and lactate performed poorly.

Conclusion

In metabolic acidosis due to TA, plasma Cl concentration decreases relative to sodium. The Cl:Na ratio is a simple alternative to the AG for detecting TA in this setting.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the anion gap to identify toxic lithium concentrations: a single-center retrospective observational study [^115NL1wd]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium exhibits a narrow margin between therapeutic doses and toxic blood concentrations, which can pose a substantial risk of toxic effects. Reportedly, lithium toxicity may be associated with a reduced anion gap; however, the precise relationship remains unclear. This study examined several different anion gap calculation methods to detect toxic lithium concentrations without directly measuring blood lithium concentrations.

Methods

Our retrospective study analyzed blood samples collected for lithium concentration measurements. The anion gap was determined using three different methods, both with and without albumin and lactate concentration corrections. Samples were categorized into two groups based on lithium concentration (< 1.5 or ≥ 1.5mmol/L), and anion gap values were compared. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between each anion gap indicator and lithium concentration. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used for diagnostic analysis.

Results

Overall, 24 measurements were collected, with 41.7% of samples falling within the toxic range. The high-lithium concentration group exhibited significantly smaller anion gaps. Correlation and logistic regression analyses revealed a significant association between anion gap values and lithium concentrations. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were: conventional anion gap 0.77 (95% CI: 0.55–0.94); albumin-corrected anion gap 0.85 (95% CI: 0.66–1.00); and both albumin- and lactate-corrected anion gap 0.86 (95% CI: 0.66–1.00).

Discussion

The anion gap is calculated as the difference between measured cations and anions. Accumulation of lithium (a cation) may decrease measured cations and decrease the calculated anion gap. Abnormal albumin and lactate concentrations may also alter the anion gap and affect its usefulness as a diagnostic marker for elevated serum lithium concentrations. A negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 suggests that the anion gap might be valuable in excluding toxicity.

Conclusions

The corrected anion gap, accounting for albumin and lactate concentrations, may be beneficial in suggesting the possibility of toxic lithium concentrations.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### Linagliptin (Jentadueto) [^111cozZc]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

WARNING: RISK OF LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as renal impairment, sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, and acute congestive heart failure.

The onset is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress.

Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate.

If acidosis is suspected, JENTADUETO should be discontinued and the patient hospitalized immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) [^115BLoPR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is a severe metabolic disorder for which the primary organic acid usually is apparent by clinical history and standard laboratory testing. We report a case of recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis in a 48-year-old man who initially presented with anorexia and malaise. Physical examination was unrevealing. Arterial pH was 6.98, P co 2 was 5 mm Hg, and chemistry tests showed a bicarbonate level of 3 mEq/L (3 mmol/L), anion gap of 32 mEq/L (32 mmol/L), and a negative toxicology screen result, except for an acetaminophen (paracetamol) level of 7.5 mug/mL. Metabolic acidosis resolved with administration of intravenous fluids. Subsequently, he experienced 5 more episodes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis during an 8-month span. Methanol, ethylene glycol, acetone, ethanol, d -lactate, and hippuric acid screens were negative. Lactate levels were modestly elevated, and acetaminophen levels were elevated for 5 of 6 admissions. These episodes defied explanation until 3 urinary organic acid screens, obtained on separate admissions, showed striking elevations of 5-oxoproline levels. Inborn errors of metabolism in the gamma-glutamyl cycle causing recurrent 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis are rare, but well described in children. Recently, there have been several reports of apparent acquired 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults in association with acetaminophen use. Acetaminophen may, in susceptible individuals, disrupt regulation of the gamma-glutamyl cycle and result in excessive 5-oxoproline production. Suspicion for 5-oxoproline-associated high anion gap metabolic acidosis should be entertained when the cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis remains poorly defined, the anion gap cannot be explained reasonably by measured organic acids, and there is concomitant acetaminophen use.

### Elevated osmolal gap in a case of multiple myeloma [^113TeNfZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The estimated serum osmolality is a measurement of solutes in the blood, including sodium, glucose, and urea, but also includes ethanol and toxic alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol) when present. These rarely measured toxic alcohols can elevate the serum osmolality, giving the true measured osmolality. The difference between that and a calculated osmolality is the osmolal gap, which can be elevated in many clinical scenarios such as renal failure, ingestion of toxic alcohols, diabetic ketoacidosis, shock, and others.

Case Report

We report a patient with a history of alcohol use disorder who came to the Emergency Department with an abnormally elevated osmolal gap in the setting of altered mental status. The patient's increased osmolal gap was further investigated while he was promptly treated with fomepizole, thiamine, and urgent hemodialysis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We discuss the differential diagnosis for substances that increase the osmolal gap with respective ranges of elevation. This case demonstrates that although osmolal gap elevation is often attributed to the presence of toxic alcohols, other common etiologies may account for the gap, including acute renal failure and multiple myeloma.

### Unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: can they predict mortality? [^113FFUTW]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and anion gap can predict lactate in adult critically ill patients, and also to determine whether acid-base variables can predict mortality in these patients.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Adult intensive care unit of tertiary hospital.

Patients

Three hundred adult critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

Interventions

Retrieval of admission biochemical data from computerized records, quantitative biophysical analysis of data with the Stewart-Figge methodology, and statistical analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

We measured plasma Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-, phosphate, ionized Ca2+, albumin, lactate, and arterial pH and Paco2. All three variables (base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, anion gap) were significantly correlated with lactate (r2 = .21, p < .0001; r2 = .30, p < .0001; and r2 = .31. p < .0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves had moderate to high accuracy for the prediction of a lactate concentration > 5 mmol/L: AUROC curves, 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–0.94), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.93), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77–0.92), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that hospital mortality rate correlated significantly with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, anion gap corrected (anion gap corrected by albumin), age, lactate, anion gap, chloride, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, strong ion gap, sodium, bicarbonate, strong ion difference effective, and base excess. However, except for APACHE II score, AUROC curves for mortality prediction were relatively small: 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84) for APACHE II, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59–0.73) for lactate, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57–0.71) for base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56–0.70) for strong ion gap.

Conclusions

Base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and anion gap are good predictors of hyperlactatemia (> 5 mmol/L). Acid-base variables and, specifically, "unmeasured anions" (anion gap, anion gap corrected, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, strong ion gap), irrespective of the methods used to calculate them, are not accurate predictors of hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients.

### A visual schematic for clarifying the temporal relationship between the anion and osmol gaps in toxic alcohol poisoning [^111nUvXC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Delayed treatment of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning can result in life-threatening complications, but obtaining quantitative levels is delayed by several hours in most hospitals. Calculating the anion gap and the osmol gap are recommended to hasten identification and treatment in cases of suspected toxic alcohol poisoning. However, relying on the anion and osmol gap calculations without understanding the temporal relationship between these 2 gaps can lead to delayed identification and increased morbidity in cases of toxic alcohol poisoning. Our "Mountain" schematic illustrates the presence of an elevated osmol gap found early in toxic alcohol poisoning and the presence of an elevated anion gap found later in the course of poisoning. Using the "Mountain" diagram as a clarification of the temporal relationship between the anion and the osmol gap can improve the diagnostic use of these screening assays.

### Correcting the anion gap for hypoalbuminaemia does not improve detection of hyperlactataemia [^116LALet]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

An elevated lactate level reflects impaired tissue oxygenation and is a predictor of mortality. Studies have shown that the anion gap is inadequate as a screen for hyperlactataemia, particularly in critically ill and trauma patients. A proposed explanation for the anion gap's poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting hyperlactataemia is that the serum albumin is frequently low. This study therefore, sought to compare the predictive values of the anion gap and the anion gap corrected for albumin (cAG) as an indicator of hyperlactataemia as defined by a lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/l.

Methods

A retrospective review of 639 sets of laboratory values from a tertiary care hospital. Patients' laboratory results were included in the study if serum chemistries and lactate were drawn consecutively. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were obtained. A receiver operator characteristics curve (ROC) was drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.

Results

An anion gap ≥ 12 provided a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 39%, 89%, 79%, and 58%, respectively, and a cAG ≥ 12 provided a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 75%, 59%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The ROC curves between anion gap and cAG as a predictor of hyperlactataemia were almost identical. The AUC was 0.757 and 0.750, respectively.

Conclusions

The sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of the anion gap and cAG were inadequate in predicting the presence of hyperlactataemia. The cAG provides no additional advantage over the anion gap in the detection of hyperlactataemia.

### Unmeasured anions in metabolic acidosis: unravelling the mystery [^116uJP48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, metabolic acidosis is a common observation and, in clinical practice, the cause of this derangement is often multi-factorial. Various measures are often employed to try and characterise the aetiology of metabolic acidosis, the most popular of which is the anion gap. The purpose of the anion gap can be perceived as a means by which the physician is alerted to the presence of unmeasured anions in plasma that contribute to the observed acidosis. In many cases, the causative ion may be easily identified, such as lactate, but often the causative ion(s) remain unidentified, even after exclusion of the 'classic' causes. We describe here the various attempts in the literature that have been made to address this observation and highlight recent studies that reveal potential sources of such hitherto unmeasured anions.

### Recognition, treatment, and prevention of propylene glycol toxicity [^115MCQyK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Propylene glycol is a commonly used solvent for oral, intravenous, and topical pharmaceutical preparations. Although it is considered safe, large intravenous doses given over a short period of time can be toxic. Underlying renal insufficiency and hepatic dysfunction raise risk for toxicity. Toxic effects include hyperosmolality, increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (due to lactic acidosis), acute kidney injury, and sepsis-like syndrome. Treatment of toxicity includes hemodialysis to effectively remove propylene glycol. Prevention is best achieved by limiting the dose of propylene glycol infused.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

### Approach to the patient with a negative anion gap [^11362PDQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When anion gap calculation generates a very small or negative number, an explanation must be sought. Sporadic (nonreproducible) measurement errors and systematic (reproducible) laboratory errors must be considered. If an error is ruled out, 2 general possibilities exist. A true anion gap reduction can be generated by either reduced concentrations of unmeasured anions such as albumin or increased concentrations of unmeasured cations such as magnesium, calcium, or lithium. This teaching case describes a patient with aspirin (salicylate) poisoning whose anion gap was markedly reduced (-47 mEq/L). The discussion systematically reviews the possibilities and provides the explanation for this unusual laboratory result.

### The difference between critical care initiation anion gap and prehospital admission anion gap is predictive of mortality in critical illness [^111uYRTe]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that the delta anion gap defined as difference between critical care initiation standard anion gap and prehospital admission standard anion gap is associated with all cause mortality in the critically ill.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

Two hundred nine medical and surgical intensive care beds in two hospitals in Boston, MA.

Patients

Eighteen thousand nine hundred eighty-five patients, age ≥ 18 yrs, who received critical care between 1997 and 2007.

Measurements

The exposure of interest was delta anion gap and categorized a priori as < 0, 0–5, 5–10, and > 10 mEq/L. Logistic regression examined death by days 30, 90, and 365 postcritical care initiation and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models. The discrimination of delta anion gap for 30-day mortality was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic curves performed for a subset of patients with all laboratory data required to analyze the data via physical chemical principles (n = 664).

Interventions

None.

Results

Delta anion gap was a particularly strong predictor of 30-day mortality with a significant risk gradient across delta anion gap quartiles following multivariable adjustment: delta anion gap < 0 mEq/L odds ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.67–0.81; p < 0.0001); delta anion gap 5–10 mEq/L odds ratio 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.35–1.81; p < 0.0001); delta anion gap > 10 mEq/L odds ratio 2.18 (95% confidence interval 1.76–2.71; p < 0.0001); and all relative to patients with delta anion gap 0–5 mEq/L. Similar significant robust associations post multivariable adjustments are seen with death by days 90 and 365 as well as in-hospital mortality. Correcting for albumin or limiting the cohort to patients with standard anion gap at critical care initiation of 10–18 mEq/L did not materially change the delta anion gap-mortality association. Delta anion gap has similarly moderate discriminative ability for 30-day mortality in comparison to standard base excess and strong ion gap.

Conclusion

An increase in standard anion gap at critical care initiation relative to prehospital admission standard anion gap is a predictor of the risk of all cause patient mortality in the critically ill.

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin- associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111RSJPA]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute metabolic acidosis of non-renal origin is usually a result of either lactic or ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with a high anion gap. There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.

Methods

Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.

Results

In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), alpha-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l-1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l-1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l-1), alpha-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l-1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l-1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l-1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l-1), alpha-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l-1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l-1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l-1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l-1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l-1).

Conclusion

The levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.

### Anion and osmolal gaps in the diagnosis of methanol poisoning: clinical study in 28 patients [^116sTKRu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate anion and osmolal gaps as diagnostic tools in methanol poisoning.

Design and Setting

Clinical observational study.

Patients and Methods

In a recent methanol outbreak, the initial triage and treatment decisions in 28 patients were based mainly upon the values of the osmolal and anion gaps on admission. Methanol and formate levels were later compared to these gaps by linear regression analysis.

Results

The correlation between the osmolal gaps and serum methanol concentrations on admission was linear (y = 1.03x+12.71, R2 = 0.94). The anion gaps correlated well with the serum formate concentrations (y = 1.12x+13.82, R2 = 0.86). Both gaps were elevated in 24 of the 28 subjects upon admission. Three patients had an osmolal gap within the reference area (because of low serum methanol), but elevated anion gap because of formate accumulation. One patient with probable concomitant ethanol ingestion had a high osmolal gap and a normal anion gap.

Conclusion

Osmolal and anion gaps are useful in the diagnosis and triage of methanol-exposed subjects. Confounders are low serum methanol and concomitant ethanol ingestion.

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^113kkZht]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO(3) increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO(3) is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) that buffers similarly to NaHCO(3) but without net generation of CO(2). The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### Rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride (Avandamet) [^11115Bfv]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

Incidence and Management: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with AVANDAMET; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1,000 patient years of exposure, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1,000 patient years of exposure). Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking AVANDAMET and by use of the minimum effective dose of AVANDAMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Treatment with AVANDAMET should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, AVANDAMET should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, AVANDAMET should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking AVANDAMET, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, AVANDAMET should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: toxic alcohol ingestion [^1123bdLe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Toxic alcohol ingestion is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of toxic alcohol ingestion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Toxic alcohols include ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, and diethylene glycol. These substances can be found in several settings including hospitals, hardware stores, and the household, and ingestion can be accidental or intentional. Toxic alcohol ingestion presents with various degrees of inebriation, acidemia, and end-organ damage depending on the substance. Timely diagnosis is critical to prevent irreversible organ damage or death and is based primarily on clinical history and consideration of this entity. Laboratory evidence of toxic alcohol ingestion includes worsening osmolar gap or anion-gap acidemia and end organ injury. Treatment depends on the ingestion and severity of illness but includes alcohol dehydrogenase blockade with fomepizole or ethanol and special considerations for the initiation of hemodialysis.

Conclusions

An understanding of toxic alcohol ingestion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Hyperglycemic, high anion-gap metabolic acidosis in patients receiving SGLT-2 inhibitors for diabetes management [^114GLi27]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are a class of antidiabetic medications that improve glycemic control via inhibiting the reabsorption of filtered glucose and are approved for use in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). These drugs have recently been associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). An increasing number of cases of SGLT-2i-associated DKA have occurred in patients with T2DM. Herein, we describe five episodes of hyperglycemic DKA in four type 2 diabetes patients receiving SGLT-2i therapy. Risk for ketoacidosis in our case series was mediated predominately by reduction of insulin dose and insulinopenia. None of the patients reported a history of low carbohydrate diet or alcohol use, and all but one patient had negative glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Resolution of DKA in SGLT-2i treated patients took longer than for T1DM patients with DKA based on literature data. The mechanisms by which SGLT-2i are associated with ketoacidosis are not fully understood and likely involve hyperglucagonemia and other factors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

Ethylene glycol toxicity is a known cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis, with the presence of an osmolar gap and the right clinical context suggesting to the diagnosis. Rapid recognition and early treatment is crucial. Unfortunately, ethylene glycol levels are not readily available and must be performed at a reference laboratory. We present a case where recognising the significance of the 'lactate gap' assisted in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning.

### Severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis induced by topiramate: a case report [^115KX8zZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A non-anion gap acidosis can be induced by topiramate, causing symptomatic dyspnea and confusion.

Objectives

Discuss the pathophysiology of the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis caused by topiramate, the typical clinical presentation, and the recommended treatment.

Case Report

This case presents a young woman with a clinically significant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis believed to be caused by topiramate. She had been taking the medication for several months without prior adverse effects. Once she began having dyspnea as a respiratory response to the renal tubule acidosis, she had decreased oral intake of food and fluids, which induced a pre-renal acute renal failure that worsened her acidemia. In the Emergency Department, she received intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and later was intubated for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. With the topiramate withdrawn, the patient had a full recovery of her renal function and metabolic acid-base status over the next 72 h. This case serves to increase awareness of this possible adverse effect and the recommended treatment as topiramate becomes more widely used.

Conclusions

Topiramate can induce a renal tubule acidosis resulting in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recognition of the underlying cause is crucial so that the drug can be withdrawn while supportive care is provided.

### Unexplained metabolic acidosis: alcoholic ketoacidosis or propylene glycol toxicity [^114Tau7X]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated anion and osmol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. The absence of detectable methanol or ethylene glycol in the serum could mean that metabolism is complete or that other hypotheses have to be considered. Ingestion of less common alcohol or alcoholic ketoacidosis should be investigated as illustrated by the present observation.

Case Report

A 46-year-old woman was admitted with altered consciousness in the Emergency Department. In the presence of a high anion gap (peak value 39 mEq/L) metabolic acidosis with mildly increased osmol gap (peak value 19 mOsm/kg), there was a high suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion in an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Serum arterial lactate concentration was particularly high at 27 mmol/L. Urinalysis failed to reveal the presence of ketone bodies or oxalate crystals. The results of the serum determination of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol were obtained within 2 h and were negative. Due to the severity of lactic metabolic acidosis and the persisting suspicion of intoxication by a less common toxic alcohol, antidotal therapy with ethanol was initiated together with hemodialysis. Correction of lactic metabolic acidosis was obtained. Results of urinalysis obtained later revealed the presence not only of propylene glycol and D-lactate but also of significant concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate as a marker of alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Discussion

The combination of propylene glycol ingestion and alcoholic ketoacidosis may have contributed to the severity of lactic acidosis.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Toxic alcohol ingestions: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^115BXWUQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related intoxications, including methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, and alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and increased serum osmolal gap, whereas isopropanol intoxication presents with hyperosmolality alone. The effects of these substances, except for isopropanol and possibly alcoholic ketoacidosis, are due to their metabolites, which can cause metabolic acidosis and cellular dysfunction. Accumulation of the alcohols in the blood can cause an increment in the osmolality, and accumulation of their metabolites can cause an increase in the anion gap and a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration. The presence of both laboratory abnormalities concurrently is an important diagnostic clue, although either can be absent, depending on the time after exposure when blood is sampled. In addition to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurologic disease can occur in some of the intoxications. Dialysis to remove the unmetabolized alcohol and possibly the organic acid anion can be helpful in treatment of several of the alcohol-related intoxications. Administration of fomepizole or ethanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in metabolism of the alcohols, is beneficial in treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol intoxication and possibly diethylene glycol and propylene glycol intoxication. Given the potentially high morbidity and mortality of these intoxications, it is important for the clinician to have a high degree of suspicion for these disorders in cases of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, or unexplained neurologic disease so that treatment can be initiated early.

Among other possible causes, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by toluene poisoning, acute diarrhea, posthypocapnic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, pancreatic fistula, Addison's disease, ileostomy and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. In addition, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as acetazolamide and cholestyramine.

### Falsely normal anion gap in severe salicylate poisoning caused by laboratory interference [^112V6Cur]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Severe salicylate poisoning is classically associated with an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, high serum salicylate levels can cause false increase of laboratory chloride results on some analyzers. We present 2 cases of life-threatening salicylate poisoning with an apparently normal anion gap caused by an important laboratory interference. These cases highlight that the diagnosis of severe salicylism must be considered in all patients presenting with metabolic acidosis, even in the absence of an increased anion gap.

### Hypoalbuminaemia in critically ill children: incidence, prognosis, and influence on the anion gap [^113q513U]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Hypoalbuminaemia has significance in adult critical illness as an independent predictor of mortality. In addition, the anion gap is predominantly due to the negative charge of albumin, thus hypoalbuminaemia may lead to its underestimation. We examine this phenomenon in critically ill children, documenting the incidence, early evolution, and prognosis of hypoalbuminaemia (< 33 g/l), and quantify its influence on the anion gap.

Methods

Prospective descriptive study of 134 critically ill children in the paediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Paired arterial blood samples were taken at ICU admission and 24 hours later, from which blood gases, electrolytes, and albumin were measured. The anion gap (including potassium) was calculated and then corrected for albumin using Figge's formula.

Results

The incidence of admission hypoalbuminaemia was 57%, increasing to 76% at 24 hours. Neither admission hypoalbuminaemia, nor extreme hypoalbuminaemia (< 20 g/l) predicted mortality; however, there was an association with increased median ICU stay (4.9 v 3.6 days). After correction for albumin the incidence of a raised anion gap (> 18 mEq/l) increased from 28% to 44% in all samples (n = 263); this discrepancy was more pronounced in the 103 samples with metabolic acidosis (38% v 73%). Correction produced an average increase in the anion gap of 2.7 mEq/l (mean bias), with limits of agreement of ± 3.7 mEq/l.

Conclusion

Admission hypoalbuminaemia is common in critical illness, but is not an independent predictor of mortality. However, failure to correct the anion gap for albumin may underestimate the true anion gap, producing error in the interpretation of acid-base abnormalities. This may have treatment implications.

### Distinguishing between toxic alcohol ingestion vs alcoholic ketoacidosis: how can we tell the difference? [^116JqVxk]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) is common in patients presenting for emergency care. While some disease processes and ingestions are easily excluded, diagnosing toxic alcohol (TA) ingestion can be challenging. This is especially true if drug concentrations are not readily available, which forces clinicians to rely on surrogate markers. Like TA ingestion, alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) produces an elevated osmol gap and an AGMA. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors suggestive of AKA when TA ingestion was the primary alternative differential diagnosis. We hypothesized that the odds of an AKA diagnosis would increase as ethanol concentration increased.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data from 2000 through 2019 from a single US Poison Control Center. Records were reviewed to identify cases coded as "methanol" or "ethylene glycol"; or coded as "alcohol" or "ethanol with acidosis". The case definition for AKA required: (1) documented alcohol use disorder; (2) urine or serum ketones or elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration; (3) anion gap ≥ 14mmol/L. The inclusion criterion for TAs was a detectable methanol or ethylene glycol concentration.

Results

Of 699 patients screened, 86 were diagnosed with AKA and 36 were diagnosed with TA ingestion. As ethanol concentration increased, the odds of an AKA diagnosis significantly increased (OR = 1.016, 95% CI 1.002–1.031, p = .03).

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis, the odds of diagnosing AKA instead of TA ingestion increased as ethanol concentration increased. The limited ability of common clinical factors to differentiate these diagnoses highlights the need to obtain quantitative TA concentrations in real time. Until prospective validation, interpretation of ketone concentrations and toxic alcohol concentrations (when available) will continue to guide decision making.

### The 'gap' in the 'plasma osmolar gap' [^117Ld7qW]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol poisoning is a medical emergency that presents challenges for clinicians and clinical laboratories. If left untreated, it may cause morbidity and death, but effective therapy is available if diagnosed in time. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is not always straightforward and the commonly quoted 'plasma osmolar gap' is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude a small ingestion and has been reported to be normal in a number of serious exposures. The 'plasma osmolar gap' cannot distinguish among ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol or ethylene glycol. Thus, the measurement of serum ethylene glycol and, ideally, glycolic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is definitive. This also holds true for methanol and its metabolite formic acid. Ethylene glycol metabolites target the kidney and lead to reversible oliguric or anuric injury, which in turn slows the elimination of ethylene glycol. The therapeutic options include reversal of metabolic acidosis, inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase and early haemodialysis.

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- **Sodium**: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- **Chloride**: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- **Bicarbonate**: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.

### A life-threatening double gap metabolic acidosis [^114J8xrK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Double gap metabolic acidosis represents the high anion gap metabolic acidosis combined with raised serum osmolal gap due to retention of unmeasured osmole with accompanied metabolite. We describe a 62-year-old man diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing continuous sedation in the context of asynchronous mechanical ventilation. High anion gap metabolic acidosis coupled with high plasma osmolal gap was noted with resultant severe bradyarrhythmia. D-Lactic acidosis and high serum concentration of propylene glycol (PG) eventually established the diagnosis of lorazepam-induced PG intoxication. Discontinuation of lorazepam followed by emergent long-extended hemodialysis effectively resolved the metabolic derangement without further recurrence. Serum osmolal gap is a sensitive and convenient surrogate for both early bedside detection and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, PG intoxication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of double gap metabolic acidosis. Early recognition with prompt hemodialysis intervention can avoid a life-threatening catastrophe.

### Mixed acid-base disturbances: core curriculum 2025 [^112AErMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in clinical practice and due to their complexity, diagnoses and treatment are challenging. The opposing effects of multiple disturbances can lead to blood pH levels that are near normal or separate acid-base disturbances can have an additive effect leading to more significant changes in blood and intracellular pH. A systematic evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and laboratory results (including acid-base balance, anion gap, electrolytes, and urine parameters) enables the rapid diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders by analyzing the appropriateness of compensatory mechanisms, assessing changes in serum and urine electrolytes, and estimating urinary acid excretion. Eight cases are provided to illustrate the approach to mixed acid-base disturbances. Examples include mixed metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders, mixed respiratory acid-base disorders, and mixed metabolic acid-base disorders.

### The acidosis of exogenous phosphate intoxication… [^112UJNPt]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Background Severe hyperphosphatemia resulting from the use of laxatives and enemas with high levels of phosphate has been the subject of many case reports. These have generally focused on the hypernatremia and hypocalcemia that develop and become life-threatening. Less attention has been paid to the metabolic acidosis of phosphate intoxication. Methods In-depth analysis of a case of severe hyperphosphatemia and review of the literature for cases with sufficient data to permit correlation between the phosphate concentration, acidosis, and anion gap. Results Marked metabolic acidosis with a large increase in the anion gap was present in our patient. The correlation between these parameters and the plasma phosphate concentration was highly significant. Despite a paucity of data in most case reports, we did uncover other cases of anion gap–positive metabolic acidosis in patients with hyperphosphatemia.

Conclusions Among high-risk patients, including the elderly and debilitated, the presence of metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, an increased anion gap, and low plasma calcium levels or a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram should raise suspicion of phosphate intoxication.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

The clinical calculator "Urine Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) is a clinical calculator primarily used in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis, specifically to differentiate between renal and extrarenal causes. It is calculated using the formula: UAG = (urine sodium + urine potassium) - urine chloride. A positive UAG suggests a renal cause of metabolic acidosis, such as renal tubular acidosis, while a negative UAG is indicative of an extrarenal cause, such as diarrhea. It is important to note that the UAG is not applicable in patients with mixed acid-base disorders or those with significant proteinuria or ketoacidosis, as these conditions can interfere with the accuracy of the calculation.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^116utD4v]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND LACTIC ACIDOSIS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning

Congestive Heart Failure

- Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients. (5.1)
- After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered. (5.1)
- Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure.
- Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. (4, 5.1)

Lactic Acidosis

- Lactic acidosis can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and acute congestive heart failure. (5.2)
- Symptoms include malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate. (5.2)
- If acidosis is suspected, discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and hospitalize the patient immediately. (5.2)

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^115uNUf8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis:

Lactic
acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due
to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion,
often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and
multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring
pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive
heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased
risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree
of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may,
therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function
in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.
In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring
of renal function. GLUCOVANCE treatment should not be initiated in patients
 ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that
renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing
lactic acidosis. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be promptly withheld in the
presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear
lactate, GLUCOVANCE should generally be avoided in patients with clinical
or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against
excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking GLUCOVANCE,
since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate
metabolism. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued prior
to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see
also PRECAUTIONS).

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^111B9Fva]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) initial fundamental testing includes markers of hypoperfusion and organ injury, with lactate emphasized for severity assessment and resuscitation tracking. Lactate levels (venous or arterial) are considered integral, and a high lactate with other CS signs should provoke rapid investigation. Serial lactate clearance is increasingly validated as an optimal prognostic marker with greater (6–8 hours) and later (24 hours) clearance associated with outcomes including mortality. Beyond lactate, the severity of acidosis (anion gap, pH, bicarbonate, base excess) is associated with shock severity, non-cardiovascular organ failures and in-hospital mortality, and differentiating CS from other shock can be aided by evaluating mixed venous saturation, systemic vascular resistance, and infections (cultures, imaging, procalcitonin).

### Unidentified acids of strong prognostic significance in severe malaria [^113QHGVk]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To calculate, using the Stewart approach to acid-base disorders, the strong anion gap as an estimate for the contribution of unmeasured plasma anions other than lactate to the metabolic acidosis that characterizes severe falciparum malaria and to assess its relative prognostic significance.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

The intensive care unit of an infectious diseases hospital in southern Vietnam.

Patients

Consecutive adult patients (n = 268) with severe falciparum malaria.

Interventions

The intervention was clinical management in a dedicated unit. We measured baseline venous lactate, electrolytes, biochemical variables, admission arterial blood pH, and gas tensions for calculation of the strong anion gap.

Measurements and Main Results

The mean (95% confidence interval) admission strong anion gap was 11.1 (10.4–11.9) mEq/L, compared with lactate (geometric mean, 95% confidence interval) at 2.9 (2.7–3.2) mmol/L. Strong anion gap had a high predictive value for mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.82), which was independent of plasma lactate and creatinine concentrations. Renal failure and hepatic dysfunction were both associated with, but were not the sole determinants of, high levels of strong anion gap.

Conclusions

In severe malaria, unidentified anions other than lactate are the most important contributors to metabolic acidosis, a major cause of death. The strong anion gap is a powerful prognostic indicator in patients with severe malaria.

### Chronic acetaminophen ingestion resulting in severe anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to 5-oxoproline accumulation: an under diagnosed phenomenon [^112ALu1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Anion gap metabolic acidosis is commonly caused by lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, and ingestion of methanol, salicylates, ethylene glycol or accumulation of organic/inorganic acids. However, rare causes of metabolic acidosis from enzyme defects, such as disturbances in the γ-glutamyl cycle, are being reported in higher frequencies in the adult population. Such disturbances cause an accumulation of 5-oxoproline and ultimately an anion gap metabolic acidosis. These disturbances are often associated with acetaminophen in the setting of certain risk factors such as sepsis, malnutrition, liver disease, female gender, pregnancy or renal failure.

### A case report of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis: mind the gap in a malnourished patient [^113YJCvu]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyroglutamic acidosis is a rare cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Most cases of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis are described in malnourished women and patients with kidney/liver failure, alcohol use or severe sepsis. In this report, we describe how pyroglutamic acidosis could be related to the use of chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 67-year-old male patient developing a pyroglutamic acidosis. The patient was initially admitted to hospital for infectious osteoarthritis and developed a metabolic acidosis during his hospital stay. Analgesics included daily therapeutic doses of paracetamol. What makes our case unusual is that our malnourished male patient did not have renal or hepatic failure. The diagnosis of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis was made after ruling out the main causes of metabolic acidosis. It was further confirmed by urine organic acids measurement showing a markedly elevated level of pyroglutamic aciduria. Paracetamol was discontinued allowing a prompt correction of the anion gap.

Conclusion

This case is a representative of pyroglutamic acidosis related to chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor. Physicians should be aware of such unusual cause of metabolic acidosis, which may be more common than expected in hospitalized patients. A high clinical suspicion is needed when urine organic acids analysis is not available.

### Estimating unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: anion-gap, base-deficit, and strong-ion-gap [^115eyV8N]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

We used 100 routine blood samples from critically ill patients to establish whether correcting the anion-gap and base-deficit for decreased plasma albumin improves agreement with the strong-ion-gap for estimating unmeasured anions and whether the modifications increase the proportion of samples with levels of anion-gap or base-deficit above the reference ranges. We used Bland-Altman analyses to compare the methods of estimating unmeasured ions. Compared with the strong-ion-gap, modification reduced the limits of agreement for both the anion-gap and the base-deficit. The bias for the base-deficit was also reduced but the bias for the anion-gap was increased. The proportion of samples with an anion-gap > 22 meq.l(-1) increased from 4 to 29% (p < 0.001), and the proportion with a base-deficit > 5 meq.l(-1) increased from 8 to 42% (p < 0.001). Consequently, metabolic acidosis from unmeasured ions in critically ill patients maybe more frequent than often recognised.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^113mnFMn]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Metformin hydrochloride

Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with ACTOPLUS MET (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride) tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see PRECAUTIONS, General: Metformin hydrochloride).

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Early anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen overdose [^112Dze4N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of early high (> 15 mEq/L) anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

Methods

A retrospective review of a cohort of 74 patients presenting within 24 hours of APAP overdose was conducted.

Results

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was present in 41% of patients on admission and persisted for 1.5 ± 0.1 days. The anion gap was associated with an elevated lactate level (4.5 ± 1 mmol/L) (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05), which persisted for 1 day. The lactate level increased in proportion to the APAP concentration (r(2) = 0.75, P < .05). Patients with increased anion gap had a higher incidence of confusion (48% vs 3%; P < .001) and lethargy (39% vs 6%; p = 0.003). Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was found in the absence of shock or liver failure. All patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine and, despite the early high anion gap metabolic acidosis, none developed hepatic failure or hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with APAP overdose is self-limited and does not predict clinical or laboratory outcomes. Persistent or late metabolic acidosis in the absence of liver failure is not likely due to APAP and should prompt a search for other causes of metabolic acidosis. Finally, APAP overdose should be considered in patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status, as this is a treatable condition when detected early.

### Serum anion gap: its uses and limitations in clinical medicine [^112tEJd9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (DeltaAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.

### Conventional or physicochemical approach in intensive care unit patients with metabolic acidosis [^116QYLdx]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is the most frequent acid-base disorder in the intensive care unit. The optimal analysis of the underlying mechanisms is unknown.

Aim

To compare the conventional approach with the physicochemical approach in quantifying complicated metabolic acidosis in patients in the intensive care unit.

Patients and Methods

We included 50 consecutive patients with a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess ≤ -5). We measured sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, lactate, creatinine, urea, phosphate, albumin, pH, and arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions in every patient. We then calculated HCO3-, the base excess, the anion gap, the albumin-corrected anion gap, the apparent strong ion difference, the effective strong ion difference and the strong ion gap.

Results

Most patients had multiple underlying mechanisms explaining the metabolic acidosis. Unmeasured strong anions were present in 98%, hyperchloremia was present in 80% and elevated lactate levels were present in 62% of patients. Calculation of the anion gap was not useful for the detection of hyperlactatemia. There was an excellent relation between the strong ion gap and the albumin-corrected and lactate-corrected anion gap (r2 = 0.934), with a bias of 1.86 and a precision of 0.96.

Conclusion

Multiple underlying mechanisms are present in most intensive care unit patients with a metabolic acidosis. These mechanisms are reliably determined by measuring the lactate-corrected and albumin-corrected anion gap. Calculation of the more time-consuming strong ion gap according to Stewart is therefore unnecessary.

### Association of time-updated anion gap with risk of kidney failure in advanced CKD: a cohort study [^1168hE4A]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

High anion gap acidosis frequently develops in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and might be involved in kidney injury. Its impact on kidney outcomes, however, has not been well studied. We sought to examine the association between time-updated anion gap and the risk of kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) among patients with advanced CKD.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

1,168 patients with CKD glomerular filtration rate categories 3b-5 (G3b-G5) who had available data on anion gap.

Exposure

High time-updated anion gap defined as values ≥ 9.2 (top 25th percentile).

Outcome

KFRT and death.

Analytical Approach

Marginal structural models were fit to characterize the association between anion gap and study outcomes while accounting for potential time-dependent confounding.

Results

The mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the study participants was 28 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years, 317 patients progressed to KFRT (7.5 per 100 patient-years), and 146 died (3.5 per 100 patient-years). In the marginal structural models, a high anion gap was associated with a higher rate of KFRT (HR, 3.04 [95% CI, 1.94–4.75]; P < 0.001). This association was stronger in patients with a baseline eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P for interaction = 0.05). High anion gap was also associated with a higher mortality rate (HR, 5.56 [95% CI, 2.95–10.5]; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses with different definitions of high anion gap showed similar results.

Limitations

Observational study design and selection bias due clinical indications for measuring anion gap.

Conclusions

Among patients with advanced CKD, high anion gap was associated with an increased risk of progression to KFRT and death.

### Persistent non-gastrointestinal metabolic acidosis in pediatric HIV-1 infection [^117URWq3]. AIDS (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the incidence and to identify the clinical parameters associated with non-gastrointestinal renal tubular and high anion gap acidosis in a cohort of HIV-1-infected children.

Methods

Records of 202 HIV-1-infected children were reviewed to identify patients with metabolic acidosis. Serum and urine chemistries of those children with persistent non-gastrointestinal acidosis were then studied prospectively. Serum and urinary anion gaps (SAG and UAG) were calculated. Those with acidosis (group 1) were compared with children without acidosis (group 2). Associations were determined with Pediatric HIV classification, height, weight, antiretroviral therapy, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.

Results

Persistent acidosis was noted in 34 out of 202 children (17%): 16 out of 34 (47%, group 1A) had elevated SAG acidosis, and 18 out of 34 (53%) had normal SAG acidosis with a positive UAG (distal renal tubular) acidosis (group 1B). Those with acidifying defects more often received P. carinii pneumonia prophylaxis (P = 0.02 and 0.01 for groups 1 and 1A, respectively) independently of HIV-1 classification. This group was shorter in height than group 2 (P = 0.007). Differences in weight were not significant (P = 0.1). However, acidotic subjects were more immunocompromised than those in group 2 (multivariate P < 0.001 for HIV classification C3).

Conclusions

Elevated SAG acidosis and renal tubular acidosis are not uncommon among HIV-infected children with advanced disease. These disorders may be associated with height growth failure and prophylaxis with sulfur/sulfone containing antibiotics. HIV infection and/or its associated therapies may cause renal tubular damage. The causes of elevated SAG acidosis require further investigation.

### An unusual case of severe anion gap metabolic acidosis in a 3-year-old girl… [^114wCBUk]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A 3-year-old previously healthy girl with normal development presents with 2 days of low-grade fevers, abdominal pain, nonbloody and nonbilious emesis occurring 6 to 7 times daily, and now tachypnea. At an urgent care clinic, she is afebrile and normotensive with a heart rate of 127 beats/min, respiratory rate of 52 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. She weighs 1 kg less than her last recorded weight measured 2 months ago. On physical examination, she has dry mucous membranes, tachypnea, substernal retractions, and inferior abdominal tenderness. She is speaking slowly and her parents endorse that she seems slightly confused. They deny access to any medications or chemicals. Her newborn screens are normal. Family history is negative for consanguinity, genetic conditions, miscarriages, stillbirths, or early childhood deaths.

Laboratory evaluation reveals a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, normal lactate, normoglycemia,… Comments.

### Differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis [^114wBZVk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Diagnosis of toxic alcohols: limitations of present methods [^117NvMU7]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol intoxications are associated with cellular dysfunction and an increased risk of death. Adverse effects can develop quickly; thus, there is a need for methods for rapidly detecting their presence.

Objective

To examine the value and limitations of present methods to diagnose patients with possible toxic alcohol exposure.

Methods

I searched MEDLINE for articles published between 1969 and 2014 using the terms: toxic alcohols, serum osmolality, serum osmol gap, serum anion gap, metabolic acidosis, methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and fomepizole. Each article was reviewed for additional references.

Results

The diagnosis of toxic alcohol exposure is often made on the basis of this history and physical findings along with an increase in the serum osmol and anion gaps. However, an increase in the osmol and/or anion gaps is not always present. Definitive detection in blood requires gas or liquid chromatography, laborious and expensive procedures which are not always available. Newer methods including a qualitative colorimetric test for detection of all alcohols or enzymatic tests for a specific alcohol might allow for more rapid diagnosis.

Conclusions

Exposure to toxic alcohols is associated with cellular dysfunction and increased risk of death. Treatment, if initiated early, can markedly improve outcome, but present methods of diagnosis including changes in serum osmol and anion gap, and use of gas or liquid chromatography have important limitations. Development of more rapid and effective tests for detection of these intoxications is essential for optimal care of patients.

### Metabolic acidosis of CKD: diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^1128dyGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is noted in the majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 20% to 25% of normal, although as many as 20% of individuals can have acid-base parameters close to or within the normal range. Acidosis generally is mild to moderate in degree, with plasma bicarbonate concentrations ranging from 12 to 22 mEq/L (mmol/L), and it is rare to see values less than 12 mEq/L (mmol/L) in the absence of an increased acid load. Degree of acidosis approximately correlates with severity of renal failure and usually is more severe at a lower GFR. The metabolic acidosis can be of the high-anion-gap variety, although anion gap can be normal or only moderately increased even with stage 4 to 5 CKD. Several adverse consequences have been associated with metabolic acidosis, including muscle wasting, bone disease, impaired growth, abnormalities in growth hormone and thyroid hormone secretion, impaired insulin sensitivity, progression of renal failure, and exacerbation of beta 2 -microglobulin accumulation. Administration of base aimed at normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentration might be associated with certain complications, such as volume overload, exacerbation of hypertension, and facilitation of vascular calcifications. Whether normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentrations in all patients is desirable therefore requires additional study. In the present review, we describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of metabolic acidosis, discuss potential adverse effects, and address benefits and complications of therapy.

### 5-oxoprolinemia causing elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of acetaminophen use [^1111SCVD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anion gap metabolic acidosis is typically encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting as the result of shock, other endogenous metabolic derangements, or from exogenous toxicants. The differential diagnosis for toxicant-related acidosis (exemplified by common mnemonics) emphasizes acute overdose.

Case Report

The case we present manifested an anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis due to a chronic intoxication: acetaminophen (APAP) overuse over a period of weeks. Lactic acidemia did not account for the AG. In this case, chronic APAP overuse, combined with decreased caloric intake and weight loss, was associated with excess 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid), an organic acid accounting for the AG metabolic acidosis. Overproduction of 5-oxoproline is attributed to depleted glutathione stores, leading to perturbation in the γ-glutamyl cycle. The patient was treated with supportive care and with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). By repleting glutathione, NAC may facilitate the resolution of excess 5-oxoproline.

Conclusions

The ED differential diagnosis of AG metabolic acidosis in chronic APAP overuse, especially with concomitant nutritional compromise, should include 5-oxoprolinemia.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na+]-([Cl -]+[HCO 3 -]) = Unmeasured anions-Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO 3 -: Δ gap = observed anion gap-normal anion gap and the Δ HCO 3 - = normal HCO 3 - -observed HCO 3 -. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO 3 - and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO 3 -. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

### Review of clinical disorders causing metabolic acidosis [^1164Bq47]. Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by metformin-induced lactic acidosis, toluene poisoning, acetaminophen overdose, alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, propylene glycol poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, starvation ketosis, multiple myeloma, maple syrup urine disease, lactic acidosis, methanol poisoning, sepsis, uremia, rhabdomyolysis, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning and pyroglutamic acidosis. In addition, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as aspirin.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^115qd9am]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is defined by metabolic acidosis and ketosis in a patient with alcohol use. This is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED) and requires targeted therapies.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of AKA for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

AKA is frequently evaluated and managed in the ED. The underlying pathophysiology is related to poor glycogen stores and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and hydrogen. This results in metabolic acidosis with elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Patients with AKA most commonly present with a history of alcohol use (acute or chronic), poor oral intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ketoacidosis on laboratory assessment. Patients are generally dehydrated, and serum glucose can be low, normal, or mildly elevated. An anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis and electrolyte abnormalities are usually present on laboratory evaluation. Management includes fluid resuscitation, glucose and vitamin supplementation, electrolyte repletion, and evaluation for other conditions.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of AKA is essential in caring for these patients.

### Pseudohyperchloremia and negative anion gap-think salicylate! [^115SkVty]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperchloremia results in a very low or negative anion gap. Historically, the most common cause of this artifact was bromide poisoning. Bromide salts have been removed from most medications and bromism has become very uncommon. More recently, the introduction of chloride ion selective sensing electrodes (Cl-ISE) has generated a new cause of pseudohyperchloremia-salicylate poisoning. We describe 5 such patients and quantitate the error generated by this measurement artifact.

Methods

The magnitude of artifactual hyperchloremia generated by high salicylate levels was quantified in 5 patients by measuring chloride concentration with several Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers and with Cl-ISEs of different "ages", and comparing these results to measurements with a chloridometer (coulometric titration), which is free of the salicylate artifact.

Results

Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers generated a wide range of artifactual chloride concentration elevation. Furthermore, the same Cl-ISE generated increasingly severe pseudohyperchloremia as it was repeatedly reused over time and "aged".

Conclusions

Salicylate interferes with measurement of the blood chloride concentration when a Cl-ISE is used. The severity of this artifact is related to the salicylate level, the specific Cl-ISE, and the "age" of the electrode. Toxic blood salicylate levels can generate marked pseudohyperchloremia, and consequently, an artifactual very small or negative anion gap. The large anion gap metabolic acidosis typical of salicylate poisoning is masked by this artifact. Salicylate has become the most common cause of pseudohyperchloremia, and physicians should immediately consider salicylate poisoning whenever the combination of hyperchloremia and a very small or negative anion gap is reported by the laboratory.

### Urine anion gap can differentiate respiratory alkalosis from metabolic acidosis in the absence of blood gas results [^116E1xMj]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low plasma bicarbonate concentration due to chronic respiratory alkalosis may be misdiagnosed as metabolic acidosis and mistreated with administration of alkali therapy, particularly when arterial blood gas is not available.

Methods

We measured urine anion gap [urine (Na + +K +)-(Cl -)], as a surrogate of renal ammonium excretion in 15 patients presenting with hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentration to distinguish chronic respiratory alkalosis (CRA) from metabolic acidosis (MA) when blood gas was unavailable.

Results

Hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentrations were associated with urine pH above 5.5 and positive urine anion gap in all, suggesting CRA. The diagnosis was later confirmed by obtaining capillary blood gas, which showed a decrease in PCO 2 and high normal pH values.

Conclusion

The use of urine anion gap can help to differentiate between chronic respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, especially when arterial blood gas is not obtained.

### Renal tubular acidosis: core curriculum 2025 [^114mKoyB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidoses (RTAs) are a subset of non-anion gap metabolic acidoses that result from complex disturbances in renal acid excretion. Net acid excretion is primarily accomplished through the reclamation of sodium bicarbonate and the buffering of secreted protons with ammonia or dibasic phosphate, all of which require a series of highly complex and coordinated processes along the renal tubule. Flaws in any of these components lead to the development of metabolic acidosis and/or a failure to compensate fully for other systemic acidoses. Identification and diagnosis of RTA can be challenging, and the consequences of untreated RTA can be life-threatening. The use of serum and urinary indices can help elucidate the kidney's capacity to respond to acidemia, characterize these disturbances further, and guide treatment.

### Approach to patients with acid-base disorders [^115qZBqk]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Disorders of acid-base balance are commonly encountered in clinical practice and can have a substantial impact on the prognosis of the patient. Moreover, identification of a particular acid-base disturbance can provide a clue to an underlying disorder. Proper evaluation and treatment of acid-base disorders requires a systematic and analytic approach including: (1) assess the accuracy of the acid-base values using the Henderson equation or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, (2) obtain a complete history and physical examination, (3) calculate the serum anion gap, (4) identify the primary acid-base disturbance and determine whether a simple or mixed disturbance is present, (5) examine serum electrolytes and additional laboratory data, and (6) measure urine pH and urine electrolytes and calculate the urine anion and osmolal gaps. Strict adherence to these principles will enable the clinician to diagnose the acid-base disturbance in the majority of cases. To illustrate these principles, 5 cases of patients with acid-base disturbances are analyzed.

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. (5.1)
Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age > 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information. (5.1)
If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended. (5.1)

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid): a role for acetaminophen [^111sbUtx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The endogenous organic acid metabolic acidoses that occur commonly in adults include lactic acidosis; ketoacidosis; acidosis that results from the ingestion of toxic substances such as methanol, ethylene glycol, or paraldehyde; and a component of the acidosis of kidney failure. Another rare but underdiagnosed cause of severe, high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is that due to accumulation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid). Reported are four patients with this syndrome, and reviewed are 18 adult patients who were reported previously in the literature. Twenty-one patients had major exposure to acetaminophen (one only acute exposure). Eighteen (82%) of the 22 patients were women. Most of the patients were malnourished as a result of multiple medical comorbidities, and most had some degree of kidney dysfunction or overt failure. The chronic ingestion of acetaminophen, especially by malnourished women, may generate high anion gap metabolic acidosis. This undoubtedly is an underdiagnosed condition because measurements of serum and/or urinary 5-oxoproline levels are not readily available.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Analgesia to acidosis: metabolic acidosis due to chronic acetaminophen (paracetamol) use [^117BjM5E]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

This case describes a rare occurrence of high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to chronic acetaminophen (paracetamol) usage, which can be confirmed by measuring 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamate), an organic acid metabolite. As acetaminophen is an extremely common drug prescribed in both inpatient and outpatient settings, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to isolate it as the aetiology for metabolic acidosis. Management includes discontinuation of acetaminophen use and at times the supplementation of oral bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis due to a high anion gap is commonly described by the mnemonic 'MUDPILES' in daily practice. A newer mnemonic, 'GOLD MARK' is proposed to be a more inclusive tool to assist in determining the cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, especially with such cases being reported.

The serum anion gap (serum [Na(+)]-Cl(-)]-[CO(2)]) is still the first-line approach to metabolic acidosis. However, while it is generally acknowledged that hypoalbuminemia mandates a downward adjustment of the expected anion gap, a specific correction factor for the anion gap in the face of low serum albumin has never been demonstrated.

Methods

We reviewed initial laboratory data from 432 consecutive patients admitted or transferred to the medical intensive care unit at Nassau County Medical Center over a 6-month period and correlated the serum albumin with the anion gap and the serum [tCO(2)] using multivariate analysis. We looked at the anion gap as a function of delta (albumin), the difference between normal and actual serum albumin, defined as 4.0 - measured serum albumin g/dl. We also assessed [tCO(2)] as an independent variable.

Results

For patients with normal or high serum tCO(2), the ratio of change in anion gap (delta anion gap) to delta (albumin) was 1.46 and 1.45, respectively. For patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l this ratio was 1.89. In the latter group, anion gap was best predicted taking both delta (albumin) and serum tCO(2) into account: anion gap = 36.2 - serum tCO(2) - 2.3 x delta (albumin) (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

For intensive care patients with normal or high serum tCO(2) (> 21 mEq/l) a simple bedside adjustment of the anion gap by subtracting 1.5 times the difference between measured serum albumin and the 'normal' level of 4.0 g/dl gives a close estimate of the actual anion gap. For intensive care patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l, correction of the anion gap is well predicted by adding about twice the Delta (albumin) to the calculated gap.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Gaps-anionic and osmolal… [^111yu5Fj]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gaps is a bedside diagnostic game. It is played in two versions by nephrologists. It deserves wider application by the practicing physician. The more popular version, Anion Gaps, shows the presence of undetermined anions and alerts the physician to the possibilities of laboratory error, severe derangements in serum protein metabolism, or the ingestion of certain ionic compounds that directly or indirectly alter the concentration of routinely undetermined anions. A second version, Osmolal Gaps, shows the presence of unmeasured osmoles or of increased plasma solids and can be used in a variety of clinical situations to direct attention to laboratory error, hyperproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, or the presence of unmeasured osmoles in the serum.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^114mfwpu]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis — diagnostic thresholds and recognition in wilderness settings — DKA is defined by a blood glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1, an anion gap > 10, pH < 7.3, and ketonemia. In the wilderness setting, it may be possible to prevent progression to advanced illness with early recognition of ketosis and treatment with subcutaneous insulin and oral hydration/glucose repletion, and symptoms of ketosis, particularly vomiting or a change in mental status, or blood glucose level elevated above 250 mg·dL−1 should prompt ketone monitoring.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Post-bariatric surgery starvation ketoacidosis and lipase elevation in the absence of DKA or pancreatitis [^112eje5K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We report a case of post bariatric surgery by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy who presented with post-surgical poor oral tolerance and high anion gap metabolic ketoacidosis, who was initially misdiagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and treated with volume supplementation without improvement. The metabolic derangements were found to be caused by starvation ketoacidosis, which was then treated with glucose supplementation, and the anion gap quickly closed. Moreover, this patient also presented with non-pancreatitis lipase elevation. This case highlights the recognition and management of post-bariatric surgery starvation ketoacidosis; additionally, clinicians should be vigilant about the interpretation and management of elevated lipase without clinical pancreatitis.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.

### Unmeasured anions: the unknown unknowns [^115dBGfS]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence is emerging that elevated concentrations of the intermediates of the citric acid cycle may contribute to unmeasured anions in critical illness. Both the anion gap and the strong ion gap are used as scanning tools for recognition of these anions. The mechanisms underlying these elevations and their significance require further clarification.

### Inhaled industrial acetylene… [^112GGX1f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

DIABETIC ketoacidosis is a relatively simple diagnosis in a patient known to have diabetes, yet the differential diagnosis on the initial presentation of a new patient includes all the standard causes of an elevated anion gap acidosis. 1 In a patient with severe anion gap acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketonuria, the presumptive diagnosis would be diabetic ketoacidosis. Because ketones can elevate serum creatinine levels through chemical interference, an inappropriately elevated serum creatinine level provides indirect evidence for ketosis. 2 The following case report describes a patient with marked anion gap acidosis, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, elevated creatinine levels, and ketonuria who did not have diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetes mellitus. Report of a Case A 28-year-old man was brought to the emergency room after being found "down" at his work site 15 minutes after the start of his shift.

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report we try to illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case illustrates that even though hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably warrant a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and need to be excluded. In that light, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic importance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.
