## Question

Constipation in a 3 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing constipation in a 3-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding red flags. Then, I should verify the presence of fecal impaction and plan disimpaction. Next, I will consider maintenance therapy, dosing, and duration. After that, I need to integrate behavioral strategies and address common pitfalls. Finally, I should define follow-up intervals, when to escalate care, and how to approach refractory constipation, while double-checking that each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis using Rome IV criteria adapted for toddlers, because functional constipation in a 3-year-old is a clinical diagnosis based on history and exam, and I should not over-order tests unless red flags are present. The key features include two or fewer defecations per week, painful or hard stools, withholding behavior, and sometimes fecal incontinence, with symptoms lasting at least 2 months and onset after 6 months of age, which fits this child's profile [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify red flags before I label this as functional constipation. I need to check for onset in the neonatal period, delayed passage of meconium beyond 48 hours, failure to thrive, explosive stools, severe abdominal distension, or neurologic deficits, because these suggest Hirschsprung disease, spinal cord anomalies, or metabolic disease and warrant specialist evaluation rather than routine management [^113rLNUx] [^115zW4px].

> Next, I should review the physical examination elements I must not miss. I will examine the abdomen for distension or a palpable fecal mass, inspect the perianal area for fissures or skin tags, and perform a digital rectal exam only if alarm features are present or constipation is intractable, because routine rectal exams are not required in straightforward functional constipation [^117SHSuP] [^113rLNUx].

> I need to ensure I assess for fecal impaction, because management hinges on clearing retained stool before starting maintenance therapy. Impaction can be inferred from a hard mass on exam, a dilated rectum full of stool, or excessive stool in the distal colon on radiograph if needed, and I should treat it promptly to reduce pain and facilitate effective maintenance therapy [^114z97oP] [^112RTdzL].

> For disimpaction, polyethylene glycol at 1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram per day for 3 to 6 days is first-line. If PEG is not available or tolerated, enemas once daily for 3 to 6 days are acceptable alternatives, and I should confirm that caregivers understand the dosing and duration to avoid undertreatment [^116PvxSt] [^1151WYms] [^117S8sWn].

> Hold on, I should verify maintenance therapy choices and dosing. PEG at 0.4 grams per kilogram per day is first-line, titrated to effect to achieve soft, painless stools, and if PEG is not available, lactulose is a reasonable alternative. I should also remember that stimulant laxatives can be added if response is inadequate, but they are generally reserved as adjuncts rather than first-line maintenance agents [^117V8iu6] [^112BVfM8] [^1159AkKu].

> I should confirm duration and stopping rules, because undertreatment is a common cause of relapse. Maintenance therapy should continue for at least 2 months, and I should not taper until the child has been symptom-free for at least 1 month, with gradual dose reduction thereafter. During toilet training, I need to ensure medications are continued until training is achieved to prevent recurrence [^1127n1fz] [^1171WuPp] [^111cTfXh].

> Let me consider behavioral strategies, and I need to be careful not to overstate their evidence. Education, a structured toilet-sitting program with rewards, and a bowel movement diary are reasonable, but routine intensive behavioral protocols have not shown added benefit over conventional care, so I should tailor behavioral support to the family's capacity and the child's developmental stage rather than impose rigid programs [^117QXMuw] [^113Af4hQ] [^113rLNUx].

> But wait, what about diet and fluids. I initially thought to emphasize fiber and fluids, but I should double-check the evidence. Routine increases in fiber beyond age-appropriate intake and extra fluids have not consistently improved outcomes, so I will avoid overpromising dietary cures and instead focus on balanced nutrition and adequate hydration as supportive measures rather than primary therapies [^113rLNUx] [^1162s63N].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and adherence checks. Reassessment at 2 to 4 weeks helps verify disimpaction success, adherence, and early response, and then visits every 4 to 8 weeks during maintenance allow dose titration and early detection of relapse. I need to explicitly ask about stool frequency, consistency, pain, withholding, and fecal incontinence at each visit [^1142zcXe] [^113rLNUx].

> I will now examine when to escalate care. If constipation persists despite confirmed adherence to optimized PEG dosing plus stimulant laxatives for at least 3 months, or if red flags emerge, I should refer to pediatric gastroenterology for evaluation of refractory constipation and consideration of motility testing or alternative therapies [^113rLNUx] [^115xrUkY].

> Hold on, I should verify how refractory constipation is defined, because terminology matters for consistency. Recent pediatric neurogastroenterology consensus defines refractory constipation by Rome IV criteria plus failure of appropriate conventional therapies including daily stimulant laxatives and behavioral interventions for at least 3 months, ongoing symptoms with infrequent stools or fecal incontinence, and impaired quality of life, which operationalizes escalation criteria for this age group [^115xrUkY] [^112N5SaZ].

> Let me reconsider common pitfalls that derail care. Undertreatment of impaction, premature discontinuation of maintenance therapy, failure to add stimulant laxatives when indicated, and lack of caregiver education about the chronic, relapsing nature of functional constipation are frequent issues. Addressing these proactively improves outcomes and reduces recurrence [^113rLNUx] [^112z91Ls].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm functional constipation and exclude red flags, clear any fecal impaction with PEG or enemas, initiate PEG maintenance with planned titration, continue for at least 2 months and until symptom-free for 1 month, incorporate age-appropriate behavioral support, and schedule structured follow-up to sustain response and promptly identify refractory disease needing specialist input [^113rLNUx] [^117V8iu6] [^1127n1fz].

Constipation in a 3-year-old is most often **functional** [^113rLNUx] and diagnosed by history and exam using Rome IV criteria [^113rLNUx]; red flags (failure to thrive, delayed meconium, neurologic deficits) warrant further workup [^115zW4px]. First-line management is **PEG 0.4–1.5 g/kg/day** [^117V8iu6] for disimpaction [^116PvxSt] and maintenance, with lactulose or milk of magnesia as alternatives [^114E4xjY] [^1159AkKu]. Add stimulant laxatives (senna, bisacodyl) if PEG is insufficient [^1159AkKu], and use enemas only for severe impaction or when oral therapy fails [^1151WYms]. Nonpharmacologic measures include toilet training, scheduled sits, and a balanced diet with adequate fluids; routine fiber or probiotics are not beneficial [^113rLNUx] [^113Tyx9o]. Continue maintenance for at least 2 months [^1127n1fz] and taper only after 1 month of symptom resolution; refer to pediatric gastroenterology if refractory after 3 months of optimized therapy or if red flags appear [^115xrUkY].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Functional constipation is defined by Rome IV as **two or more of the following** occurring at least once per week for at least 2 months [^notfound]:

- ≤ 2 defecations per week
- ≥ 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week
- Retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention
- Painful or hard stools
- Large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet
- Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum

In children with a developmental age < 4 years, the criteria are adapted to **exclude toilet training** and include **painful or hard stools** and **fear of painful defecation**.

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Functional constipation is **multifactorial**, with common contributors including:

- **Withholding behavior**: Often triggered by painful defecation or stressful toilet training [^115u7pDA].
- **Dietary factors**: Low fiber intake, inadequate fluids, and excessive milk consumption [^notfound].
- **Behavioral factors**: Anxiety, stress, and inconsistent toilet routines [^1125etW8].
- **Family history**: Positive family history of constipation is common [^1125etW8].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Obtain a detailed history, including:

- Stool frequency, consistency, and caliber
- Presence of fecal incontinence or withholding behaviors
- Dietary intake (fiber, fluids, milk)
- Toilet training status and routines
- Family history of constipation
- Red flags (failure to thrive, delayed meconium passage, neurologic symptoms) [^115zW4px]

---

### Physical examination

Perform a focused examination, including:

- Growth parameters (weight, height)
- Abdominal examination for distension or palpable fecal masses
- Perianal inspection for fissures, skin tags, or anal stenosis
- Neurologic examination (tone, reflexes, gait) to exclude neurologic disorders [^notfound]

Routine laboratory tests are **not indicated** unless red flags are present [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Initial management

#### Disimpaction

If fecal impaction is present, initiate **disimpaction** with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days [^116PvxSt]; if PEG is unavailable, use enemas (saline or phosphate) once daily for 3–6 days [^1151WYms].

---

#### Maintenance therapy

After disimpaction, initiate **maintenance therapy** with PEG 0.4 g/kg/day, adjusting to effect [^117V8iu6]; alternatives include lactulose or milk of magnesia if PEG is unavailable or not tolerated [^114E4xjY] [^1159AkKu]. Add stimulant laxatives (senna or bisacodyl) if PEG alone is insufficient [^1159AkKu].

---

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are **essential**:

- **Toilet training**: Scheduled sits (5–10 minutes) after meals with positive reinforcement [^117QXMuw].
- **Dietary modifications**: Balanced diet with adequate fluids; routine fiber supplementation is not beneficial [^113rLNUx].
- **Behavioral strategies**: Address withholding, anxiety, and stress-related behaviors [^115zW4px].

---

## Duration and follow-up

Continue maintenance therapy for at least 2 months [^1127n1fz], ensuring symptoms resolve for at least 1 month before tapering. Regular follow-up every 4–8 weeks is recommended to monitor adherence, adjust therapy, and prevent relapse [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Refer to a pediatric gastroenterologist if:

- Refractory constipation despite optimized therapy for ≥ 3 months [^115xrUkY]
- Presence of red flags (failure to thrive, delayed meconium, neurologic symptoms) [^115zW4px]
- Need for specialized diagnostic testing (anorectal manometry, colonic transit studies) [^114CsD1T]

---

## Prognosis

Functional constipation in toddlers generally has a favorable prognosis with appropriate management, though **relapses are common** and prolonged therapy may be necessary [^115u7pDA]. Approximately 50% of children experience relapse within the first 5 years, underscoring the importance of sustained maintenance therapy and follow-up [^112WY2S3].

---

Constipation in a 3-year-old is **usually functional** and managed with a combination of disimpaction, maintenance laxatives, and behavioral strategies. Persistent symptoms or red flags warrant specialist evaluation.

Discussion

Therapy-resistant constipation is a common and formidable challenge in paediatric clinical practice. It is crucial to have a clear and explicit definition of this clinical entity in order to implement appropriate management strategies at an early stage that may improve outcomes. The Rome criteria clearly define functional constipation in infants, toddlers and children. However, after an extensive review of the existing paediatric literature, we were unable to find a clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation for children, especially in terms of the duration of unresponsiveness to optimal medial management before being labelled as therapy-resistant constipation. Although the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE, UK) has defined therapy-resistant constipation, the duration of symptoms of constipation is, however, not included in their definition. Widely varying definitions found in our review show the lack of consensus among these definitions. We believe that it is imperative to use unambiguous terminology that includes, rigorous criteria of failure, type of therapeutic interventions and their precise duration in defining therapy-resistant constipation.

Terminology of therapy-resistant constipation

Several studies have used the term intractablewhile others have used the term refractory. It is interesting to note that some studies have used both terms. Although, it is clear that both terms are being used in the definition of medically unresponsive constipation, the literature shows no agreement on the terminology and use the terms refractory and intractable loosely and interchangeably. It is important for researchers and healthcare professionals to come to a consensus on the terminology used to describe therapy-resistant constipation as it helps to understand the pathophysiology, recognise symptomatology, use the correct diagnostic tools, compare treatment regimens and design clinical trials.

Time frame of therapy-resistant constipation

It is also evident that there is no clear agreement among studies on the duration of medical treatment before children are deemed to be considered as therapy-resistant constipation. Among the studies that provided an explicit definition for therapy-resistant constipation, there is no definitive time duration that can be used as a benchmark. Most studies with an explicit definition seem to believe that symptoms must persist for at least 3 months to meet the criteria for therapy-resistant constipationwhile some studies have set a longer time frame of 12 (4/47)or 24 months (2/47), respectively. Among those studies that do offer an explicit definition, there is still no consensus about how long symptoms need to persist in order to be considered as therapy resistant.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^1141C5hN]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment approach for constipation — after discontinuing medications that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (ie, fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended before anorectal testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). NTC and STC can be safely managed with long-term use of laxatives (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^112WqSay]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline — consensus process, grading, and scope: Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions was graded, and three consensus meetings were held in September 2012, February 2013, and May 2013 using a 9-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 9 = fully agree). Consensus was defined a priori as > 75% of members voting 6, 7, 8, or 9, and consensus was reached for all questions. The guideline presents 2 algorithms; one pertains to the infant from birth to 6 months (instead of 1 year) and the other to the older child, reflecting that infants < 6 months old have different diagnostic considerations. Both algorithms apply to any child presenting with constipation of at least 2 weeks' duration and include evaluation and treatment options for "intractable" constipation. This guideline should be revised every 3 to 5 years.

Introduction

Functional constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects children globally. Based on the available data, it has a pooled prevalence of 9.5%. Constipation is a frequent cause of emergency department visits. It can result in substantial use of clinical resources in outpatient departments, particularly among children. Additionally, constipation can significantly impact public funds through annual health budgets, directly and indirectly.

Several guidelines describe the management of childhood constipation. Even with optimal management, about one-third of children are deemed to have therapy-resistant constipation. Although childhood functional constipation is clearly defined using the Rome criteria, there is no such definition for children not responding to optimal management. Several authors have defined therapy-resistant constipation using the duration of unresponsiveness to medical management varying from 3 months to 2 years without clear consensus. In addition, clinicians and researchers use the terms 'refractory' and 'intractable' interchangeably, complicating the definition of therapy-resistant constipation.

Therapy-resistant constipation has long-term physical and psychological complications. In addition, some children with therapy-resistant constipation undergo invasive diagnostic tests such as barium enema, defecography, anorectal and/or colorectal manometry. The majority of these children need (a combination of) oral laxatives, enemas or transanal irrigation. A smaller proportion requires even needs surgical interventions, such as sacral neuromodulation, antegrade continence enema, the formation of diversion stomas and surgical resection of the bowel, or subtotal colectomy, with ileorectal anastomosis, all interventions which have significant morbidity and a high incidence of complications. Therefore, it is imperative to clearly define therapy-resistant constipation to ensure consistent deployment of therapies to this group and consistent understanding of the goals and outcomes of therapies in these circumstances. Against this backdrop, we aimed to conduct a systematic review to determine how interventional studies define the condition and propose a way forward for an internationally accepted definition.

### Evaluation and treatment of constipation in infants and children: recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^112LmaVV]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Constipation, defined as a delay or difficulty in defecation, present for 2 or more weeks, is a common pediatric problem encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers. The Constipation Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric constipation. The Constipation Guideline Committee, consisting of two primary care pediatricians, a clinical epidemiologist, and pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on an integration of a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee developed two algorithms to assist with medical management, one for older infants and children and the second for infants less than 1 year of age. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, including evaluation, initial treatment, follow-up management, and indications for consultation by a specialist. The Constipation Guideline Committee also provided recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist.

### Management of functional constipation in children and adults [^117KfksE]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Functional constipation is common in children and adults worldwide. Functional constipation shows similarities in children and adults, but important differences also exist regarding epidemiology, symptomatology, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup and therapeutic management. In children, the approach focuses on the behavioural nature of the disorder and the initial therapeutic steps involve toilet training and laxatives. In adults, management focuses on excluding an underlying cause and differentiating between different subtypes of functional constipation - normal transit, slow transit or an evacuation disorder - which has important therapeutic consequences. Treatment of adult functional constipation involves lifestyle interventions, pelvic floor interventions (in the presence of a rectal evacuation disorder) and pharmacological therapy. When conventional treatments fail, children and adults are considered to have intractable functional constipation, a troublesome and distressing condition. Intractable constipation is managed with a stepwise approach and in rare cases requires surgical interventions such as antegrade continence enemas in children or colectomy procedures for adults. New drugs, including prokinetic and prosecretory agents, and surgical strategies, such as sacral nerve stimulation, have the potential to improve the management of children and adults with intractable functional constipation.

Strengths and limitations

This review has several strengths. We searched a number of databases to identify the relevant literature and included all possible papers as well as abstracts which had defined therapy-resistant constipation. We identified articles which had both explicit as well as implicit definitions, therefore, were able to understand the components that are needed to scientifically define therapy-resistant constipation. It was decided not to restrict inclusion of the articles based on the quality assessment as that had no implication on the definition of therapy-resistant constipation. A limitation of our study is that we excluded articles published in non-English languages where we could have missed some of the definitions. However, observing the trends of definitions used in articles published in the English language, it is unlikely that this would affect the overall conclusions of the present article.

It is important to establish consensus on a definition for this clinical paradigm. As many aspects of the different definitions given in the literature directly inform the choice of therapeutic goals for patients, professionals and researchers, clarity on these definitions will directly inform such practice. It is possible that this research has uncovered a spectrum of overlapping but distinct clinical presentations. It is also possible that a single consensus is needed with other incomplete understandings of this clinical phenomenon as identified in our findings, rejected by the clinical community. It is, therefore, vital as a future and relatively urgent research goal to reach such an international consensus. The most appropriate method to achieve this would be through either a round table or Delphi process.

Conclusions

We conclude by stating although there is a significant literature on therapy-resistant constipation in children; however, there is no consensus definition in terms of the terminology, the maximum medical treatment and duration of maximum medical intervention before identifying as having medically unresponsive constipation. It is crucial to clearly define therapy-resistant constipation in children as it significantly impacts the management and outcome and can prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful further investigations and invasive treatment. It is important to establish a consensus and incorporate this definition into guidelines and criteria to ensure consistency in treatment.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to children with chronic refractory constipation: consensus report by the SIGENP motility working group [^112WY2S3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in children, accounting for about 3% of all primary care visits and up to 25% of referrals to paediatric gastroenterologists. Although polyethylene glycol often proves effective, most children require prolonged treatment and about 50% of them have at least one relapse within the first 5 years after initial recovery. When conventional treatment fails, children are considered to have refractory constipation. Children with refractory constipation deserve specialist management and guidance. Over the last decades, there has been a remarkable increase in our knowledge of normal and abnormal colonic and anorectal motility in children, and a number of different techniques to measure transit and motility have been developed. The present review analyses the possible diagnostic investigations for children with refractory constipation, focusing on their actual indications and their utility in clinical practice. Moreover, we have also analytically reviewed medical and surgical therapeutic options, which should be considered in selected patients in order to achieve the best clinical outcome.

### How do we define therapy-resistant constipation in children aged 4–18 years old? A systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis [^111ttyHt]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Therapy-resistant constipation often is a frustrating clinical entity recognised by the persistence of infrequent and painful bowel movements faecal incontinence and abdominal pain despite intensive treatment. It is important to clearly define therapy-resistant constipation before children are subjected to invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Aim

To conduct a systematic review determining how paediatric interventional studies define therapy-resistant constipation.

Method

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTR and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies that included patients with therapy-resistant constipation were identified. Data were extracted on criteria used for defining therapy-resistant constipation and reported using a meta-narrative approach highlighting areas of convergence and divergence in the findings.

Results

A total of 1553 abstracts were screened in duplicate, and 47 studies were included in the review. There were at least seven definitions used in the paediatric literature to define medically resistant constipation. The term intractable was used in 24 articles and 21 used the term refractory to describe therapy-resistant constipation. Out of them, only 14 articles have attempted to provide an explicit definition including a predefined time and prior therapy. There were 10 studies without a clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation. The duration before being diagnosed as therapy-resistant constipation varied from 1 months to 2 years among studies. Seven studies employed the Rome criteria (Rome III or Rome IV) to characterising constipation while five adopted the Rome III and European and North American paediatric societies definition of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition guideline of management of constipation in children.

Conclusion

The current literature has no explicit definition for therapy-resistant constipation in children. There is a need for a detailed consensus definition to ensure consistency of future research and to avoid unnecessary and maybe even harmful, invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

### Childhood constipation: evaluation and treatment [^112dzmME]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Constipation is common in children. It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of pediatric patients have constipation and/or encopresis. Constipation is the second most referred condition in pediatric gastroenterology practices, accounting for up to 25% of all visits. In this article, a practical approach is laid out for those not familiar with constipation in children. Emphasis is placed on the evaluation and management options that are available to the treating practitioner. The diagnosis of constipation requires careful history taking and interpretation. Diagnostic tests are not often needed and are reserved for those who are severely affected. The daily bowel habits of children are extremely susceptible to any changes in routine environment. Constipation and subsequent fecal retention behavior often begins soon after a child has experienced a painful evacuation. Childhood constipation can be very difficult to treat. It often requires prolonged support by physicians and parents, explanation, medical treatment, and, most important, the child's cooperation.

### Management of constipation in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^115KziTg]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a practical, readily applied algorithm for primary health care providers to identify, evaluate, and manage constipation in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

Methods

The Gastroenterology Committee of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN), a multisite consortium of centers dedicated to improving standards of medical care for children with ASDs, guided the development of the constipation algorithm through expert opinion and literature review. The algorithm was finalized based on results of field testing by nongastrointestinal, ATN autism medical specialists at 4 ATN sites. A systematic review and grading of the literature pertaining to constipation and children with ASDs was also performed.

Results

Consensus among the ATN Gastroenterology Committee identified that in children with ASDs, (1) subtle or atypical symptoms might indicate the presence of constipation; (2) screening, identification, and treatment through a deliberate approach for underlying causes of constipation is appropriate; (3) diagnostic-therapeutic intervention can be provided when constipation is documented; and (4) careful follow-up after any intervention be performed to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of the therapy. Literature review revealed limited evidence for the clinical evaluation or treatment strategies of children with ASD and constipation.

Conclusions

Constipation and its underlying etiology have the potential to be effectively identified and managed using a systematic approach. Lack of evidence on this topic in the literature emphasizes the need for research.

Pediatric refractory constipation (RC) — definition and criteria: The authors recommend that pediatric RC be defined by the presence of 4 specific clinical criteria, explicitly requiring ongoing constipation symptoms in children who meet Rome IV criteria for pediatric FC with failure to improve after a minimum of 3 months, usage of age- and developmentally appropriate conventional constipation therapies, and impaired QoL. Ongoing symptoms are defined by ≤ 2 voluntary defecations per week and/or ≥ 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week. Conventional constipation therapies should include the use of daily stimulant laxatives at appropriate dosages in addition to behavioral and biomechanical interventions (Agreement 8/8). The authors agreed upon a 3-month duration of ongoing symptoms per these parameters.

### Constipation in children and adolescents: evaluation and treatment [^113rLNUx]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Constipation in children is usually functional constipation without an organic cause. Organic causes of constipation in children, which include Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord abnormalities, commonly present with red flag signs and symptoms. A history and physical examination can diagnose functional constipation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The first goal of managing constipation is to treat fecal impaction, and then maintenance therapy is used to prevent a recurrence. Polyethylene glycol is the first-line treatment for constipation. Second-line options include lactulose and enemas. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake above usual daily recommendations and adding probiotics provide no additional benefits for treating constipation. Frequent follow-up visits and referrals to a psychologist can assist in reaching some treatment goals. Clinicians should educate caregivers about the chronic course of functional constipation, frequent relapses, and the potential for prolonged therapy. Clinicians should acknowledge caregivers' specific challenges and the negative effects of constipation on the child's quality of life. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when there is a concern for organic causes or constipation persists despite adequate therapy.

Results

A total of 1535 studies were identified on a search conducted on the 3 November 2022, 1466, of which were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. 69 studies were screened for eligibility. 25 studies were excluded: duplicates (16), opinion pieces (3) and literature/systematic reviews (3). A total of 47 studies (28 full papers, 16 abstracts and 3 trial registrations) were included and downloaded for data extraction as PDF files (figure 1).

PRISMA flow chart. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Description and characteristics of included studies

The 47 studies included in the systematic review comprised 28 full papers, 3 clinical trial registrations and 16 abstracts. The year of publication of the studies was from 1996 to 2022. The studies came from diverse geographical regions; from North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America. Online supplemental table 1 provides study characteristics including design, definition of therapy-resistant constipation used by the researchers, terminology used to define therapy resistant constipation, duration of treatment before being diagnosed with therapy-resistant constipation and the source of reference.

Definitions of therapy-resistant constipation

There were at least seven clear definitions of therapy- resistant constipation for children in the published literature included in this review. Most of these variations are due to the duration of therapeutic interventions before labelling children as having therapy-resistant constipation and the terminology used to define therapy-resistant constipation. Some of them included refractory constipation: symptoms not responsive to conventional therapy, functional constipation unresponsive to optimal conventional treatment for at least 3 months, chronic constipation not responding to maximum laxative therapy, behavioural therapy and toilet-training programme with duration of symptoms of > 2 years, and all children presenting with chronic constipation and showing no response to rigorous medical management over a period of 1 month or more. It is important to note that 10 articles had no clear definition at all.

Terminology (refractory or intractable)

21 studiesused the word refractory while 24 studiesused the word intractable to describe treatment resistant constipation. Two studies used refractory and intractable interchangeably.

### Development of an early nurse led intervention to treat children referred to secondary paediatric care with constipation with or without soiling [^113zW3re]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is common in children. Five to thirty percent of the children are constipated at some time depending on the diagnostic criteria. More than one third of children develop chronic symptoms. Constipation is a common reason (4%) for referral of children to secondary care. The exact cause of constipation is not fully understood. Pain is thought to be the most important feature prompting fear and with-holding of passing stools. This leads to chronic symptoms. Eventually incontinence with often overflow of stools, takes place. Incontinence can have devastating psychological sequelae. There is agreement on diagnostic criteria. NICE have established assessment requirements and have systematically reviewed and made recommendations regarding medical treatment.

However, as Sackett described, the best external evidence c.f. NICE needs to be integrated with individual clinical expertise in order to realise the best clinical outcomes. This is where the practice of care for children with constipation falls down. Some healthcare professionals underestimate the impact of constipation on the child and family. Children and families are often given conflicting advice. Practice is inconsistent, making treatment potentially less effective and frustrating for all concerned. Children often develop constipation while still in nappies. They are seldom treated or followed up unless there are other features such as blood in the stools from an anal fissure. By the time they reach 3.5–4 years parents are expecting and 'expected' to have a child who is 'toilet trained'. By this time, constipated children have often with-held stools for 2–3 years. They may have already developed treatment resistant or intractable constipation defined as: 'constipation which does not respond to sustained optimum medical management'. This may contribute to the often poor clinical outcomes seen in children with constipation.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^115dB9T7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric refractory constipation (RC) introduction and methods emphasize that RC requires a targeted diagnostic evaluation and complex management strategy, and that currently, there is no clear definition, evaluation, and management strategies for RC. Referral patterns highlight undertreatment: approximately one third of patients referred to a tertiary care center for "refractory functional constipation" were not on a laxative at their first pediatric gastroenterology clinic visit, and about a quarter of pediatric patients struggle with constipation into adulthood. This is the first North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) position paper to provide guidance around the definition, evaluation, and management of pediatric RC and should be used by pediatric gastroenterologists as an adjunct to the best practice guidelines, identifying the utilization of optimal functional constipation (FC) treatments as a first step for defining patients with RC. Methods note project timing and search approach: it was initially conceived in the Spring of 2021 and PubMed and Cochrane databases were utilized for literature searches through January 31, 2023 on specified constipation topics.

### Constipation: beyond the old paradigms [^114CsD1T]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in children. Although most children respond to conventional treatment, symptoms persist in a minority. For children with refractory constipation, anorectal and colonic manometry testing can identify a rectal evacuation disorder or colonic motility disorder and guide subsequent management. Novel medications used in adults with constipation are beginning to be used in children, with promising results. Biofeedback therapy and anal sphincter botulinum toxin injection can be considered for children with a rectal evacuation disorder. Surgical management of constipation includes the use of antegrade continence enemas, sacral nerve stimulation, and colonic resection.

### How do we define therapy-resistant constipation in children aged 4–18 years old? A systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis [^116bEz8Z]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Studies with description with prior medical therapy

11 studies with an explicit definition have considered prior medical therapy before being considered as therapy-resistant constipation. These therapies include maximum doses of osmotic and stimulant laxatives, and extensive behavioural therapy and toilet training. All three guidelines published by NICE, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN, and Indian Academy of Paediatrics have defined the standard management. High-dose polyethylene glycol is used to evacuate the rectal faecal mass as the first step and rectal enemas and suppositories are used when there is poor response to polyethylene glycol. All three guidelines agreed on polyethylene glycol-based therapy as the first-line maintenance therapy for childhood constipation and stimulant laxatives are added when there is a poor response. Therefore, we believe that there should be consensus on the choice of drugs, their dosages, the order of usage of different laxatives, both oral and rectal laxatives and the duration of therapy. The recommended therapy in these guidelines can be used as a steppingstone in defining the optimal medical intervention before being labelled as therapy-resistant constipation.

Previous literature on defining therapy-resistant constipation

A previous systematic review analysing adult literature has also attempted to define pharmacologically therapy-resistant constipation in adults. In this study, 61 papers were reviewed to define pharmacologically therapy-resistant constipation. Similar to our findings, they also found the terminology of severe, refractory and intractable interchanging being used without consensus. In addition, the duration of therapy for constipation prior to be labelled as therapy resistant varied from 6 to 12 months with some studies not specifying the duration but only mentioning several years.

Functional constipation in children — search strategy and inclusion criteria are detailed as follows: Systematic literature searches were performed by a clinical librarian from inception to October 2011 in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsycInfo. Questions 1 and 2 were answered based on expert opinions and earlier published guidelines (5–9), whereas questions 3 to 9 used systematic literature searches. Eligible studies included children of ages 0 to 18 years, had to provide a clear definition of functional constipation, and for diagnostic accuracy (question 3) had to define the reference standard using history and physical examination. For treatment/intervention effects (questions 6–8), inclusion required systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and/or randomized controlled trials containing at least 10 individuals per arm. For outcome/prognosis (questions 4, 5, and 9), inclusion required systematic reviews of prospective or retrospective controlled studies and original studies with a follow-up of at least 8 weeks. Additional identification strategies included searching reference lists, and no language restriction was applied.

### Constipation in childhood [^115u7pDA]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Constipation in children is an often long-lasting pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorder with a worldwide prevalence varying between 0.7% and 29.6%, and estimated health-care costs of US$3.9 billion per year in the USA alone. The pathophysiology of childhood constipation is multifactorial and remains incompletely understood; however, withholding of stools, starting after an experience of a hard, painful, or frightening bowel movement is the most common cause found in children. A thorough medical history and physical examination, including a rectal examination in combination with a bowel diary, is sufficient in the majority of cases to diagnose constipation. The current standard treatment consists of education, toilet training, disimpaction, maintenance therapy and long-term follow-up. In the past decade, well-designed treatment trials in the pediatric population have emerged and long-term outcome studies have been completed. This Review summarizes the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of childhood constipation, including pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment, with particular emphasis on the latest available data.

Based on these ratings and patient preferences, 8 outcome measures were selected: pain during defecation, defecation ≥ 3 times per week, fecal incontinence frequency, difficulty with defecation, worsening constipation, quality of life, possible harm from laxatives (tolerance, adverse effects), and abdominal pain. For grading, diagnostic and prognostic questions used the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine classification, and therapeutic questions used GRADE; if no therapeutic studies were found, the quality of evidence was defined as "low".

Approach to technical review

The technical reviews will be completed in line with methods guidance from Cochrane, the GRADE handbook, JCE (Journal of Clinical Epidemiology) GRADE guidelinesand our previously developed approaches to such guidelines:

Studies against placebo, no treatment and all active comparators will be considered. Network Meta-analysis will be deployed to triangulate findings and where certainty is high, moderate or low and clinical homogeneity exists, be presented as additional data with the use of appropriate Graphics On Recommendations Diagram Of Network Meta-analysis Plots. Subgroup analyses will be performed for outcome measures in the case of different comparator groups, given that heterogeneity and a sufficient volume of studies exist.
Outcome measures were based on the previous publication of a core outcome set for defining the treatment effects of FC in children. Following the GRADE handbook, outcomes were defined as critical, important or not important through a Delphi process and a face-to-face meeting held to agree on the final set of outcomes in May 2024 (stated below).
The GDG will complete a Delphi process to prospectively agree on the critical (primary) and important (secondary) outcomes of focus for the guideline and the decision thresholds for the outcome measures before proceeding to data analysis. The threshold ranges will be trivial, small, moderate and large treatment effects. These ranges will be identified for each of the included outcome measures separately. The limit of the small treatment effect will represent the minimally important clinical difference for GDG decision-making.
Key to the refinement of the specific questions will be to prioritise outcomes for use that were a reflection of the most clinically relevant and meaningful, as well as always balancing efficacy with safety.
Therapy delivered in all settings and by all professionals, as well as self-administered therapies will be considered but detailed extraction will gather such data to consider as a source of heterogeneity and to aid clinical interpretation.

Study selection

Types of studies

All published, unpublished and ongoing RCTs that compared interventions for the management of FC RC with other active interventions or standard therapy, placebo or no therapy will be considered for inclusion. Studies that described 'faecal impaction' will be considered in separate searches.

Observational studies could be considered for inclusion and GRADE only if they met the following criteria: large sample size, clear control of confounding factors and very large differences in effect between groups. Observational studies are not included in formal searches and the GDG will include these based on their knowledge of the field and reference searching of included studies.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^113f7fxp]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a pediatric problem commonly encountered by many health care workers in primary, secondary, and tertiary care. To assist medical care providers in the evaluation and management of children with functional constipation, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition were charged with the task of developing a uniform document of evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

Nine clinical questions addressing diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic topics were formulated. A systematic literature search was performed from inception to October 2011 using Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsychInfo databases. The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was applied to evaluate outcomes. For therapeutic questions, quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Grading the quality of evidence for the other questions was performed according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. During 3 consensus meetings, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. The group members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. Expert opinion was used where no randomized controlled trials were available to support the recommendation.

Results

This evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of children with functional constipation to standardize and improve their quality of care. In addition, 2 algorithms were developed, one for the infants < 6 months of age and the other for older infants and children.

Conclusions

This document is intended to be used in daily practice and as a basis for further clinical research. Large well-designed clinical trials are necessary with regard to diagnostic evaluation and treatment.

### Evaluation of constipation [^115GdiPw]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Constipation is the reason for 2.5 million physician visits per year in the United States, with more than one half of these visits to primary care physicians. Patients and physicians frequently define constipation differently. To determine the underlying cause of constipation, it is important to evaluate the patient's general health, psychosocial status, medical illnesses, dietary fiber intake, and use of constipating medications. The differential diagnosis of constipation and the approach to its evaluation differ in adults and children. Tests of physiologic function are usually reserved for constipation that does not respond to conventional therapy. Family physicians can effectively manage most patients who have constipation.

Refractory constipation (RC) in pediatric patients should be recognized as a distinct condition with long-term impacts on patient and family quality of life. RC requires a more targeted diagnostic evaluation and complex management strategy that may involve management by pediatric neurogastroenterology and motility specialists and multidisciplinary teams including surgeons. Currently, there is a lack of a clear definition, evaluation, and management strategies for RC. This is the first North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition position paper to address pediatric RC regarding its definition, evaluation, and management.

### How do we define therapy-resistant constipation in children aged 4–18 years old? A systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis [^115UqGGf]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Studies with no clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation

We also found that a significant number of studies have not attempted to clearly define medically unresponsive constipation. In those studies, there was no clear identification of duration of medical unresponsiveness. Although beyond the scope of defining the therapy-resistant constipation, some studies which had not clearly defined the unresponsiveness have reported outcomes of major surgical interventions as treatments for children. We believe this is one of the reasons that demands an internationally accepted definition for medically unresponsive constipation in children. Other reasons why we need a standard definition include, harmonising research in this important disease entity and identifying epidemiological and pathophysiological nuances related to refractory/intractable constipation.

Studies that used the variations of Rome criteria to define therapy-resistant constipation

The Rome criteria do not provide a clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation. However, we found that a notable proportion of studies (10 out of 47) have used the Rome criteria to describe refractory constipation. One study implemented the Rome IV criteria without specifying a duration, four studies employed the Rome III/IV criteria with a specific duration. Three studies employed Rome III criteriaand one study used Rome IV criteriawith specific duration. Among the studies that established a duration, some considered a period of 6 months or longer, one study used a period of 12 monthswhile others required the fulfilment of the Rome III/IV criteria for a minimum of 3 months of treatment. It is evident that researchers look on the Rome process to have a definition for medically unresponsive constipation. This reinforces the importance of having a clear and consistent definition for medically refractory constipation in future iterations of the Rome criteria to ensure the high quality and validity of research findings on childhood constipation as well as optimal care for those with severe unresponsive constipation.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^113LAakG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Future guideline updates

The methodological approach used in this guideline has been innovated in many core areas. The GDG would suggest that, as a minimum, an update is commissioned within 3 years to allow completion and publication of a new guideline within 5 years. However, the significant achievement to identify, extract, appraise, and synthesize the evidence base offers an opportunity to also innovate in future guideline efforts.

The GDG suggests that the option of a living review of the evidence and therefore a living guideline is considered. Given the relatively small number of new trials per year, such an approach would offer the chance for any significant changes in the overall certainty of evidence and, in turn, potential recommendations to be identified and actioned in a more timely fashion.

As such, an approach would have implications for resources, requiring the sponsoring societies to consider methods to commission this, as well as agreeing on specific operating procedures for such an innovation for both societies, due consideration and joint agreement prospectively would be required. In spite of such barriers, such an approach would be the most appropriate to truly achieve ongoing evidence‐based guidance within clinical practice.

### Practice patterns of pediatricians and trainees for the management of functional constipation compared with 2006 NASPGHAN guidelines [^111EhrVg]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has formulated guidelines for managing functional constipation. There have been no studies that have investigated how pediatricians apply the constipation guideline since it was revised in 2006. The purpose of this study was to examine how pediatricians approach functional constipation and how closely their approaches adhere to the guidelines.

Methods

An anonymous multiple-choice questionnaire was developed by general pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists. This was distributed to pediatricians and pediatric residents at 7 academic institutions, and to the American Academy of Pediatrics section on medical students, residents, and fellowship trainees mailing list.

Results

A total of 1202 responses were received (952 trainees, 250 attendings). Of these, 84.3% reported being unfamiliar/slightly familiar with the guidelines. The most common initial interventions for constipation without fecal incontinence included fluids (92.1%), fiber (89.5%), juice (77.7%), behavioral interventions (71.2%), follow-up (53.4%), and reducing constipating foods (50.1%). The most common initial interventions for constipation with fecal incontinence included bowel cleanout (73.4%), maintenance medication (70.0%), fluids (67.9%), behavioral interventions (67.6%), fiber (66.1%), and follow-up (57.8%). Osmotics were the most commonly prescribed as needed (83.0%) and maintenance medications (96.8%), with stimulants prescribed PRN by 35.6% and as maintenance by 16.8%. Some individuals (39.7%) reported concern that osmotics could result in dependence, addiction, or electrolyte imbalances, compared with 73.0% for stimulants.

Conclusions

Our results show that more education regarding medication in functional constipation is necessary, including the use of medication reducing time to remission, the necessity of disimpaction, and misconceptions regarding adverse effects.

### Evaluation and treatment of constipation in children and adolescents [^115zW4px]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Childhood constipation is common and almost always functional without an organic etiology. Stool retention can lead to fecal incontinence in some patients. Often, a medical history and physical examination are sufficient to diagnose functional constipation. Further evaluation for Hirschsprung disease, a spinal cord abnormality, or a metabolic disorder may be warranted in a child with red flags, such as onset before one month of age, delayed passage of meconium after birth, failure to thrive, explosive stools, and severe abdominal distension. Successful therapy requires prevention and treatment of fecal impaction, with oral laxatives or rectal therapies. Polyethylene glycol-based solutions have become the mainstay of therapy, although other options, such as other osmotic or stimulant laxatives, are available. An increase in dietary fiber may improve the likelihood that laxatives can be discontinued in the future. Education is equally important as medical therapy and should include counseling families to recognize withholding behaviors; to use behavior interventions, such as regular toileting and reward systems; and to expect a chronic course with prolonged therapy, frequent relapses, and a need for close follow-up. Referral to a subspecialist is recommended only when there is concern for organic disease or when the constipation persists despite adequate therapy.

### What is the role of stimulant laxatives in the management of childhood constipation and soiling? [^116kLz4F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field.

Selection Criteria

All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the administering of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

No trials were found that met the selection criteria.

Main Results

No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.

### Awareness and implementation of the 2014 ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guideline for childhood functional constipation [^113nc93W]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to assess whether physicians approach children with functional constipation according to the 2014 European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)/North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guideline.

Methods

We invited pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists in the Netherlands and the United States to participate in this anonymous survey using a self-developed questionnaire containing 19 multiple choice questions concerning evaluation and treatment of children with constipation.

Results

We included 328 physicians (67% from the United States, 34% from the Netherlands). The majority of US responders (53%) worked in primary care, whereas all Dutch responders worked in a hospital. In total, 31% of responders were not familiar with the guideline (38% US responders vs 16% Dutch responders, P < 0.001). Perianal inspection was frequently ("often" or "always" on a 5-point Likert scale) conducted by 78% of responders. Digital rectal examination was frequently done by 42%. Inquiry about sexual abuse was made by 18%. Commonly reported reasons for omitting these items were perceived patient or parental discomfort. Most frequently implemented initial nonpharmacological interventions included a toilet training program (89%), optimizing fluid and fiber intake (86% and 81%), a defecation diary (62%), and a reward system (60%). Polyethylene glycol was the most prescribed medication for disimpaction (68%) and maintenance treatment (57% for infants, 97% for children ≥ 1 year).

Conclusions

Many responders were not familiar with the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline for functional constipation. Nonetheless, therapeutic decisions correlated fairly well with recommendations from the guideline, especially for children 1 year of age or older. Guideline awareness and adherence remain to be improved. Future studies should focus on exploring strategies to improve guideline implementation through the development of digital learning tools.

To assist primary care providers, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published clinical practice guidelines for management of childhood constipation. A cross-sectional survey of pediatricians from across the United States was conducted to assess pediatricians' constipation management strategies, whether pediatricians are familiar with the NASPGHAN constipation guidelines, and reasons pediatricians refer constipated patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Overall, 75% of pediatricians used polyethylene glycol without electrolytes to treat childhood constipation, 8% of pediatricians were aware NASPGHAN had published constipation guidelines, and parental pressure was just one reason pediatricians referred constipated patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^115MkoR5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric refractory constipation (RC) limitations and conclusions — There is variability in the evaluation and management of RC among pediatric gastroenterologists, and this article is an attempt to provide a standardized definition of pediatric RC and establish a common management pathway for this complex patient population. In the treatment of pediatric RC, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to guide when to use specific constipation medications over others and to investigate the safety, efficacy, and outcomes of secretagogues or serotonin agonists alone or in combination with stimulant laxatives; further assessment of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, protocolization of pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) with and without feedback, and employment of occupational therapists would also help advance the field. From a surgical standpoint, there is a need to develop biomarkers associated with colonic distention and dysfunction to better understand indications for surgical interventions in RC, refine the identification and long-term management of diverting ileostomies, and pursue protocolization of tapering off and discontinuing ACEs. Key limitations include that the major limitation is in the search methods due to the lack of a clear definition for pediatric RC, that an organized framework like the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach could not be utilized, and that the absence of a common definition has limited creation of predictive models through longitudinal studies. Timely identification of pediatric RC combined with consistent use of stimulant laxatives and use of common management strategies may improve QoL for pediatric patients, and a standardized pediatric RC definition will benefit the advancement of evaluation and management through future targeted studies.

### Novel and alternative therapies for childhood constipation [^115U2adq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common and distressing pediatric problem. Even if prevalence of this disorder has increased, treatment of constipation in children is still largely based on clinical experience rather than on evidence-based studies. The currently recommended treatment includes education, disimpaction, and maintenance therapy, consisting of dietary changes, behavioral modification, and use of laxatives. Among osmotic agents, polyethylene glycol solutions appear to be the first-line drug to use in pediatrics. Although these measures are effective in the majority of children, a sizable proportion needs long-term therapy. Chronicity may significantly interfere with the child's emotional growth and development. Advances in the understanding of the gastrointestinal enteric nervous system and epithelial function have led to the development of new classes of drugs. These include substances that bind to serotonin receptors or are chloride channel activators. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits and the risks of these new drugs.

### Towards a definition of refractory / therapy-resistant / intractable constipation in children: a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey [^111twcf2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional constipation is a prevalent gastrointestinal clinical entity affecting children worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 9.5%. International guidelines outline the diagnostic workup and treatment of childhood constipation. Despite the best management practices and even in cases of full compliance, around one-third of children do not respond to standard treatments, progressing into adulthood with constipation. Persistent symptoms may lead to physiological and psychological consequences. Furthermore, some of these children undergo invasive investigations such as contrast studies and colonic biopsies, and a subset of them are subjected to irreversible surgical interventions such as colonic resection.

None of the international diagnostic criteria iterations published by the Rome Foundation (Rome II–IV) provide criteria to diagnose therapy-resistant constipation.

Due to the lack of a clear consensus clinical definition for this significant clinical problem, researchers have adopted many definitions which in turn describe a heterogeneous set of clinical paradigms. Common terms (refractory and intractable) may define different time durations for symptoms, and various requirements for previous therapeutic interventions but even within the use of the same term, studies vary in how they practically define it.

A recent meta-narrative systematic review also found only a few studies that gave explicit definitions at all. The lack of a clear definition substantially impacts research and, most importantly, clinical practice, leaving doubt as to the appropriateness of different therapies in different settings, the sequencing of treatments and the need for expert escalation.

It is a priority for therapy-resistant constipation to have a single consensus definition to aid clinical and research practice. The best way to reach such a consensus definition is by obtaining the view of practising clinicians.

Therefore, we sought to understand the perspectives of practising paediatricians, paediatric gastroenterologists and paediatric researchers on the definition of therapy-resistant constipation in children using an international cross-sectional study design.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^112BVfM8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Maintenance therapy for childhood constipation — PEG with or without electrolytes is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment. A starting dose of 0.4 g
- kg−1
- day−1 is recommended and the dose should be adjusted according to the clinical response. Addition of enemas to the chronic use of PEG is not recommended. Lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, if PEG is not available. Based on expert opinion, the use of milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as an additional or second-line treatment. Maintenance treatment should continue for at least 2 months. All symptoms of constipation symptoms should be resolved for at least 1 month before discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should be decreased gradually. In the developmental stage of toilet training, medication should only be stopped once toilet training is achieved.

### Unmet needs in pediatric functional constipation [^112z91Ls]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Education and Clinical Practice

Currently, the knowledge and awareness among pediatricians of PFC pathophysiology and diagnosis and treatment strategies are quite limited, creating barriers to disease management. While treatment guidelines are a valuable resource providing clarity on disease definition, diagnosis, and overall approaches to treatment, a recent survey found that 84.3% of practicing pediatricians (n = 967 completed responses) considered themselves to be unfamiliar or slightly familiar with the current NASPGHAN treatment guidelines. Regarding common initial interventions for PFC without fecal incontinence, polled physicians opted for increased fluid intake (92.1%), dietary fiber (89.5%), prune/fruit juice (77.7%), behavioral interventions (71.2%), regular follow-up (53.4%), and reducing constipating foods (50.1%). Medication was reserved as the secondary intervention in most cases (55.2%), highlighting its lack of use until after the previous interventions failed. The above-mentioned study also reported that for constipation with fecal incontinence, bowel cleanout was considered crucial because disimpaction needs to occur before maintenance therapy can begin, yet 26.6% of respondents were unaware of this intervention. Regarding the choice of maintenance medication, 90.5% of respondents used osmotic laxatives, 27% used stimulant laxatives, and 28% used a combination of the two. Given that stimulant laxatives may be useful as rescue medication in refractory cases and in children with cecostomies, their use should be encouraged or at least evaluated more often.

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2024 protocol for paediatric functional constipation treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure) [^113hmPSv]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional constipation (FC) is an extremely common problem in children of all ages worldwide, with a pooled prevalence of 9.5%. Constipation is often associated with sporadic or occasional and/or infrequent painful defaecation, faecal incontinence and abdominal pain and therefore causes significant distress to children, young people and their families. In addition, FC has a significant impact on healthcare services.

In 2014, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published a joint evidence-based guideline on the treatment of childhood constipation. Since then, many new studies have been published. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria have been updated with the publication of the latest Rome-IV criteria for paediatric FC. The final area of significant development relates to the methodological advances within guideline development, most notably within the procedures of the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach to both appraising evidence and producing guidelines.

This protocol describes the prospectively designed and agreed standard operating procedures that will be followed to produce a GRADE international treatment guideline, seeking to include recommendations for all approaches, used in clinical practice today. The final guideline will additionally consider faecal impaction (FI) and refractory constipation (RC) as well as the surgical management of constipation. The final guideline will contain the official recommendations of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) on all treatment aspects.

The guideline will support health professionals, patients and their families. The methods used for technical review, GRADE analysis and decision-making will allow its dissemination. The prospective publishing of this document is part of that process of systematic guideline production.

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2024 protocol for paediatric functional constipation treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure) [^114hoWmi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Development of recommendations

In line with our operating procedure steps, the full technical reviews, summary of findings tables and evidence to decision frameworks will be given to the GDG members for review. The data and GRADE summary of findings tables will be added to the evidence to decision frameworks.

A face-to-face meeting will be held to discuss any key features of note in the evidence, areas of convergence in individual studies, direct and network meta-analysis.

Where there are clear signals in the evidence base, recommendations will be prepared, followed by voting. Where there is a more disordered or diverging evidence base, discussion and if an appropriate recommendation can be developed, voting will be held.

All recommendations will follow the GRADE approach and nomenclature with the strength of a recommendation based on the evidence to decision frameworks, aligned with the language of the aforementioned level of strength.

The non-voting team will refine this into a final list of recommendations and ensure the strength of the recommendations to be made is consistent with the evidence presented and views of the GDG, as per the GRADE recommendation guidance. They will also facilitate the face-to-face meeting.

Voting will be anonymous and all members with conflicts will abstain. An online voting system will count YES, NO and ABSTAIN votes. If ≥ 75% of voting members agree, a recommendation will be passed. If there is no such an agreement, a further discussion will be held for a maximum of 30 min with either the same or revised recommendation voted. If no consensus can be reached, the recommendation will be left pending further exploration and revisiting.

If the evidence does not support a GRADE level recommendation but there is a sufficiently clear experiential and broader evidence base as well as a significant agreement on a statement that has clear actionable benefit, a Good Practice Statement will be made.

The final proposals will be agreed by consensus, with the strength of agreement, certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations all presented.

The final synthesised recommendations will be prepared in a guideline to meet the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN and journal publication standards. The evidence for decision frameworks will be made available as supplementary material and the technical evidence published in full as concomitant outputs to support the main guidance.

### Systematic literature review and meta-analysis on therapeutic management of faecal impaction in the paediatric population [^112RTdzL]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

To date, there is no widely accepted definition of faecal impaction (FI). In general, it is referred to as a large mass of compacted stool in the rectum and/or colon that cannot be spontaneously evacuated.FI can be identified by physical examination, including rectal examination, or with the help of imaging techniques (abdominal radiograph, ultrasound). Lack of definition could reflect the understanding of FI as a symptom of wider constipation, rather than a standalone condition. However, it is a common reason for acute presentation in constipated children. Prompt attention to FI is vital to minimise the risk of complications and avoid inappropriate or prolonged treatment. There is also no universally accepted or standardised protocol for the management of FI. Currently, various therapeutic strategies exist including pharmacological (laxatives, lubricants, prucalopride, lubiprostone, linaclotide, enemas/ rectal irrigation), or surgical (ACE procedure).

FI may form as a result of certain conditions (neurological, endocrine), however, in this systematic literature review, we are focusing on FI that developed as a result of functional constipation (FC). FC is one of the most common disorders of gut–brain interaction in children with prevalence ranging between 0.7% and 29.6%. It is diagnosed according to ROME IV criteria. Children with FC are found to have lower health-related quality of life compared with healthy controls, more behavioural problems and emotional symptoms. Often FC is accompanied by FI. One study found that out of 169 children who were diagnosed with FC, 76 (45%) had FI. Another study reported FI in 66% of children who qualified for an FC diagnosis. Hereby, identification and treatment of FI are paramount in establishing the well-being of a child.

Due to varied definitions for FI as well as varied treatment options, it can be difficult for a caregiver to decide on the best treatment strategy for children presenting with FI. Some of the treatment options are invasive, and not the preferred first choice for the management of FI in children. In this review, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for faecal disimpaction in children with FC (0–18 years). We also aim to propose a stepwise approach for treatment escalation, therefore suggesting a guide for caregivers to use when managing FI. Finally, this meta-analysis serves as a template to identify gaps in the current literature and guide researchers towards the areas that need development.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^116dzRCP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterology, Feeding, and Nutrition

Individuals with PLAN commonly experience dysphagia. Children with infantile PLAN gradually lose oral feeding abilities, which eventually result in the inability to maintain adequate nutrition and/or hydration, and risk of aspiration pneumonia. Discussion of this progression and early preparation for the eventual need for gastrostomy tube feeding will help make this transition smoother for families. A feeding specialist or team should continue to re-evaluate, make recommendations about food textures, safe feeding approaches, and nutritional supplementation and determine the timing of referral for gastrostomy tube placement.

Although early efforts are often directed toward increasing intake, in children with decreasing mobility (eg, those with infantile PLAN), caloric intake will likely later need to be decreased to avoid excessive weight gain.

When is the ideal time to place a gastrostomy tube?

A gastrostomy tube should be placed when the individual cannot eat safely or maintain nutritional or hydration status, or when oral feeding has become excessively difficult or time-consuming, if not sooner. The goal is to proceed while the nutritional status is still optimal, and the family is not in crisis. This is best achieved using shared decision making, informing and supporting caregivers while considering caregiver and individual values. Providers should begin the conversation early, particularly for children with infantile PLAN, all of whom will require gastrostomy tube feedings. Connecting families to patient organizations could help provide practical information and support.

How should constipation be managed?

Constipation is often a significant challenge in PLAN that can impact comfort and quality of life. A principle of management is to develop a consistent regimen that prevents constipation rather than responding with as-needed treatments when constipation becomes problematic. Dietary management and physical activity and movement (eg, stander use) can be very helpful. Caution should be used around medications with constipation as a side effect (iron, trihexyphenidyl, glycopyrrolate). Stool softeners are typically used for constipation not responsive to dietary changes. Given that autonomic dysfunction in PLAN can affect gastric motility, the addition of a motility agent may be needed. Suppositories or enemas can be used as needed. In challenging cases, a gastroenterologist should be involved.

What is known – what is new

What is Known:

For disimpaction, oral laxatives are recommended as first choice treatment according to clinical guidelines, because it is considered less invasive.
There is variation in laxative policies among pediatricians.

What is New:

Enemas may represent a child-friendly alternative in cases where large quantities of laxatives, administered by nasogastric tube, are required.
Repetative reminders for 8 weeks to continue laxatives after symptom resolution may reduce hospital admission

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^115Aq35f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric refractory constipation — segmental colonic dysmotility and antegrade continence enema (ACE) strategy: A multicenter report noted pediatric patients had a "median age of 9.6 years" and "92% of patients avoided colonic resection after treatment with ACE", while "The majority of patients (7/8) who failed treatment with ACE underwent a subsequent colonic resection". Recommendations 6.4.1 specify: "For segmental colonic dysfunction, an ACE trial should be performed before colonic resection.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^115FhnRx]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric refractory constipation — antegrade continence enema (ACE) flush solutions: "No RCTs demonstrate the optimal administration of ACE regarding duration, frequency, or solution recipes". "Commonly used irrigation base solutions for daily ACE use in pediatrics are NS and PEG with electrolytes". "Patients should avoid softened tap water due to increased sodium content". "NS can be obtained from a pharmacy or prepared at home by mixing 1.5 teaspoons of noniodized salt with 1000 mL of tap water. Parents should be educated on the correct measurement technique to prevent hyponatremia". "PEG with electrolytes can be used as the initial irrigation solution or alternatively upon failing NS irrigations".

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^117NJG7k]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Laboratory and structural evaluation — screening for secondary causes and initial management steps are outlined. A complete blood cell count should be performed. Although metabolic tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum glucose, creatinine, and calcium) are often performed, their diagnostic utility and cost-effectiveness have not been rigorously evaluated and are probably low. A structural evaluation of the colon may be appropriate in certain circumstances, especially if the patient has alarm symptoms or has not undergone age-appropriate screening for colon cancer, and colonoscopy, computed tomographic colonography, or flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema will effectively exclude lesions that could cause constipation. If this evaluation uncovers a secondary cause for constipation, the appropriate treatment can be offered, the patient's medications can be adjusted when possible to avoid those with constipating effects, and a trial of fiber and/or over-the-counter laxatives can be instituted.

Current Treatment Options

Oral laxatives are the most commonly prescribed treatments for fecal disimpaction and maintenance therapy, but their long-term use has not been adequately evaluated. - The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes, dosed orally (1–1.5 g/kg/d) for 3 to 6 days as the first-line treatment for children presenting with fecal impaction. If PEG is unavailable, lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, whereas milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as additional or second-line treatment. While significant improvements in constipation symptoms have been reported with both osmotic (eg, PEG) and stimulant (eg, senna) laxatives in RCTs, approximately 40% to 50% of children with functional constipation experience at least 1 episode of relapse within the first 5 years after initial recovery. Dietary fibers, traditional medicine, and probiotics are commonly used; however, the clinical evidence supporting their use is not clear.- Prebiotics and probiotics may be effective at improving clinical symptoms, but data from RCTs are limited.

Among the nonpharmacological interventions, sacral neuromodulation provides a suitable option for refractory PFC, but it is not frequently used, and data on its clinical benefits in children are limited. In a prospective cohort study (n = 30), sacral neuromodulation improved the mean defecation frequency, which was sustained over a prolonged period; however, the quality of life of the patients continued to be lower than that of the normal population. Enemas are effective for severe PFC, but their long-term use in children is often impractical and may be perceived as uncomfortable. Several surgical approaches, including antegrade enemas, are associated with improved clinical outcomes in severe and intractable constipation. Surgical implantation of conduits for antegrade enema may cause complications such as stoma-related and other perioperative complications; however, long-term use of antegrade enemas does yield successful results in nearly 70% of cases.

### Systematic literature review and meta-analysis on therapeutic management of faecal impaction in the paediatric population [^1134tqcQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

When considering the review itself, one of the potential limitations is related to the lack of definitions for FI. We chose to use the studies reporting of this as the key criteria for considering the patients, rather than considering the full range of childhood constipation literature. There may be an overlap with some studies offering therapy for impaction as part of a constipation protocol and essentially in combination with long-term therapy, but we have not included these. It is also important to note that the nature of the interventions in this review is such that many do not support viable blinding. This leads to difficult decisions within GRADE and is a source of potential subjectivity. Finally, the reporting within the primary studies was limited in a number of ways that hampered the review. Despite best efforts to use methods that minimised the impact, such as contacting primary authors.

Currently, there are no clear implications for practice from this review and this is a reflection of the many issues we have raised in this discussion. This does not mean therapies should not be used, but rather that no high-quality evidence exists to guide choices or a specific therapy in this context. This is despite how common this clinical paradigm presents and how often these therapies are used in the clinical setting.

There are substantial implications for research. A consensus definition on FI is vital. It is possible that this chooses to view the condition as standalone or as a symptom of constipation but defining how long symptoms need to occur and how to diagnose is vital to support research. Once a definition exists, key outcomes of interest can also be agreed. This is contentious and a source of heterogeneity in this review and needs a consensus to support future investigation. The combination of clear definitions and critical outcomes will then support further research. Issues with risk of bias must be addressed. We would also suggest the choice of interventions for study should be made with formal consultation with stakeholders, including patients, in line with other approaches in the field. This will not only ensure relevance of studies but that a focus on key interventions will allow a high certainty outcome to be achieved with good precision.

### Constipation in children [^114b3nzh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevalence of childhood constipation has been estimated at 0.7% to 29.6% in the general population worldwide; most children have no obvious aetiological factors. One third of children with chronic constipation continue to have problems beyond puberty. Half of children with chronic faecal impaction and faecal incontinence have experienced an episode of painful defecation, and many children with chronic constipation exhibit withholding behaviour.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for children with chronic constipation? What are the effects of treatments for clearing the bowel in children with faecal impaction? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anal dilatation, behavioural treatments (biofeedback, diaries, or toilet training), bulk-forming laxatives, enemas, faecal softeners, fibre, macrogols, oral fluids, osmotic laxatives, prebiotics, probiotics, stimulant laxatives, and surgical disimpaction.

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^1125etW8]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common health problems in infancy and early childhood. Even though they are mostly transient, they may be very distressing to a new parent as well as the child. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation), functional constipation (FC) and infantile colic are among the most common FGIDs, and they can occur separately or combined. Both reflux and colic self-resolve by the age of 12 months, however FC often continues into toddlerhood, peaks when toilet training starts, and in extreme cases continues even to adulthood. The prevalence of paediatric FC is difficult to determine. It is a global issue, but it varies greatly across geographical regions. Most studies report it to range from 0.5 to 32%, with a global pooled prevalence of 9.5%. FC is characterized by infrequent bowel movements, hard and/or large stools, painful defecation, and faecal incontinence, and is often accompanied by abdominal pain. FC is not caused by anatomic abnormality, inflammation, or tissue damage, but the exact cause is still unclear. Its pathophysiology is thought to be multifactorial. Risk factors include stress, dietary habits, physical activity, obesity, family history of FC, poor toilet training, psychological difficulties, child maltreatment, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Stooling avoidance is seen as the key factor of paediatric FC.

FGIDs have been linked to both short- and long-term (negative) effects on health and quality of life of young children as well as their caregivers. For example, both children with FC as well as their families have lower health-related quality of life, while school aged- children had persistent fatigue with significant school absenteeism. Due to the magnitude of the problem, paediatric FC has also substantial impact on healthcare and medical costs.

Conventional treatment for FC consists of pharmacological intervention, i.e. laxatives for stool disimpaction, in combination with non-pharmacological measures such as education and toilet training. The prevailing consensus among experts is that paediatric FC should not be treated with dietary interventions. This is to a great extent due to the lack of sufficient high-quality data supporting efficacy of dietary treatments. However, experts also agree that proper balanced diets, with special focus on fibre and fluid intake, should be an integral part of the maintenance therapy of children that have been pharmacologically treated for FC.
