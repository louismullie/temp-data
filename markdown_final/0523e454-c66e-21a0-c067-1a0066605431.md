## Question

what are some effective medications for sore throat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are effective for sore throat and how to prioritize them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are treating viral, bacterial, or indeterminate sore throat. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for symptomatic treatments versus antibiotics. Next, I will examine corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and local therapies like flurbiprofen. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with dosing and caveats, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Most sore throats are viral and self-limited, so symptomatic relief is the primary goal, whereas antibiotics are reserved for confirmed or high-likelihood bacterial pharyngitis, typically group A streptococcus, where benefits are modest and complication prevention is the key rationale rather than dramatic symptom relief [^116NcnPh] [^112ACtFT].

> I will now examine corticosteroids because multiple high-quality meta-analyses suggest a modest but clinically meaningful benefit. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing. Single low-dose dexamethasone increases the likelihood of complete pain resolution at 24 hours by about 2.2-fold and at 48 hours by about 1.5-fold, and accelerates onset of pain relief by roughly 4–6 hours and complete resolution by about 11 hours, with an absolute pain reduction around 1.3 points on a 0–10 scale at 24 hours, which exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of about 1 point [^114dQPo6] [^114iZTSq] [^113PdqbD]. Hold on, I should confirm applicability. The effect appears consistent across adults and children 5 years and older, in primary care and emergency settings, and regardless of whether antibiotics are given, though the absolute benefit is smaller in milder disease, which supports selective use rather than routine administration [^1147D17p] [^113jLX4r].

> Next, I should review NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Guidelines consistently recommend ibuprofen or acetaminophen as first-line symptomatic therapy for acute sore throat, and although acetaminophen helps some cold symptoms, evidence for direct improvement in sore throat is limited and inconsistent, so I need to be cautious not to overstate its effect on throat pain specifically [^112zVjz2] [^113JjAh6]. Let me reconsider NSAIDs. Systemic NSAIDs reduce pain and fever in acute infections, and locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg provides rapid, clinically meaningful relief with onset within minutes and duration up to 4–6 hours, which can be particularly useful when patients need fast relief without systemic exposure, though I should note that much of the flurbiprofen data are from narrative reviews and non-inferiority trials rather than Cochrane-grade syntheses [^116LRVB2] [^112S9qF4] [^1166e3Mm].

> Now, antibiotics. I should double-check the size of benefit. Antibiotics shorten sore throat symptoms by about 16 hours on average and reduce the risk of some suppurative complications, with the clearest signal for acute otitis media and quinsy, but the absolute symptom benefit is modest and the number needed to treat for early pain relief is around 5–6, rising to about 18–21 by one week as most patients improve spontaneously, so antibiotics should be reserved for confirmed or high-likelihood GAS pharyngitis or when complications are a concern [^116NcnPh] [^1156fVtp] [^112ACtFT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. In patients with negative testing or low pretest probability, the benefit is smaller and the harms of overtreatment, including resistance and adverse effects, outweigh the gains, reinforcing a test-and-treat or delayed prescribing approach in primary care [^116NcnPh] [^113bY21x].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy. First-line should be simple analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for all patients, with consideration of a single low-dose corticosteroid in those with moderate to severe pain after shared decision-making, and local flurbiprofen as an adjunct for rapid relief, while antibiotics are reserved for confirmed or high-likelihood GAS infection or when complications are a concern, ideally guided by Centor/McIsaac criteria and rapid testing to avoid unnecessary prescribing [^112zVjz2] [^116kskpY] [^113bY21x] [^112ACtFT]. I should confirm dosing. Dexamethasone 10 mg orally or intramuscularly once, or 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg in children, is the typical regimen studied, and flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge or spray can be used every 3–6 hours as needed, with attention to NSAID precautions in those with contraindications [^115BX2Xn] [^116LRVB2].

> But wait, what about safety and special populations. I need to ensure I flag contraindications to corticosteroids such as uncontrolled diabetes, active tuberculosis, systemic fungal infection, or immunosuppression, and counsel that repeated steroid bursts for recurrent sore throat are discouraged due to cumulative risks, which is why guidelines frame this as a weak recommendation for selective use rather than routine care [^116kskpY] [^115BX2Xn]. For children under 5, evidence is limited and corticosteroids are not routinely recommended, so I should avoid extrapolating adult data to very young children and prioritize acetaminophen or ibuprofen with careful clinical judgment [^1147D17p].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. Effective options with the best balance of benefit and safety include NSAIDs and acetaminophen for all, single-dose corticosteroids for moderate to severe pain after shared decision-making, and local flurbiprofen for rapid relief, while antibiotics are reserved for confirmed or high-likelihood bacterial pharyngitis given their modest symptom benefit and important role in complication prevention in the right patients [^1144BvYF] [^114dQPo6] [^116LRVB2] [^116NcnPh] [^112ACtFT].

---

Effective medications for sore throat include **NSAIDs (ibuprofen)** [^1144BvYF] and **acetaminophen** for pain and fever relief [^114mNfRj], with **corticosteroids (single-dose dexamethasone)** as an adjunct for severe pain or dysphagia [^114dQPo6] [^116kskpY]. Antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** [^116NcnPh] because most sore throats are viral; reserve them for confirmed or high-risk bacterial cases (e.g. GAS) [^112ACtFT] [^113bY21x]. Local flurbiprofen 8.75 mg (lozenge or spray) provides rapid, short-term relief [^116LRVB2] [^112S9qF4] and is a useful alternative when systemic NSAIDs are unsuitable. Avoid routine corticosteroids in mild cases due to limited benefit and potential harms [^114WiSF5].

---

## Analgesics and antipyretics

Analgesics and antipyretics are **first-line** for symptomatic relief of sore throat, reducing pain and fever [^1144BvYF].

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen (NSAID) | Effective for pain and fever; superior to acetaminophen for anti-inflammatory relief [^notfound] | Gastrointestinal irritation, renal effects; use with caution in patients with GI ulcers, renal impairment, or cardiovascular disease |
| Acetaminophen (paracetamol) | Effective for pain and fever; suitable for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs | Hepatotoxicity with overdose; safe within recommended doses |

---

## Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids provide **modest, short-term relief** of severe sore throat, particularly with dysphagia or odynophagia [^114dQPo6] [^116kskpY].

- **Efficacy**: Single low-dose dexamethasone (oral or intramuscular) increases the likelihood of complete pain resolution at 24–48 hours and reduces time to pain relief by ~4–6 hours [^114dQPo6] [^114iZTSq].
- **Safety**: Short-term use is generally safe; avoid in immunocompromised patients, those with systemic infections, or recurrent episodes due to potential cumulative effects [^115BX2Xn].
- **Guidelines**: Weak recommendation for adjunctive use in severe cases; not routine for mild sore throat [^116kskpY] [^114WiSF5].

---

## Antibiotics

Antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** for sore throat because most cases are viral [^116NcnPh]; reserve for confirmed or high-risk bacterial infections, such as group A streptococcus (GAS) [^112ACtFT].

- **Efficacy**: Modest symptom reduction (~16 hours) and reduced risk of complications (e.g. acute otitis media, peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever) in bacterial cases [^116NcnPh] [^1156fVtp].
- **Guidelines**: Use only with positive rapid antigen test or high clinical suspicion (e.g. Centor/McIsaac score ≥ 3) [^1174zw4c] [^113bY21x].
- **First-line antibiotics**: Penicillin V or amoxicillin; alternatives for penicillin allergy include cephalosporins, macrolides, or clindamycin [^112ACtFT] [^114AaBsW].

---

## Local anesthetics and topical agents

Local anesthetics and topical agents provide **short-term relief** of sore throat symptoms [^116LRVB2].

- **Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg (lozenge or spray)**: Rapid onset (1–2 minutes), duration 3–4 hours; effective for pain, dysphagia, and swollen throat sensation [^116LRVB2] [^112S9qF4].
- **Lidocaine-containing products**: Short-term numbing relief; limited evidence for significant clinical benefit [^114M9Tbm].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs (ibuprofen) | Pain, fever | First-line |
| Acetaminophen | Pain, fever | First-line |
| Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) | Severe pain, dysphagia | Adjunctive; single dose |
| Antibiotics | Confirmed or high-risk bacterial infection | Reserve for confirmed cases |
| Flurbiprofen (local) | Short-term relief | Alternative to systemic NSAIDs |

---

Effective medications for sore throat include **NSAIDs and acetaminophen** for pain and fever, with corticosteroids as adjuncts for severe symptoms [^1144BvYF] [^114dQPo6]. Antibiotics are reserved for confirmed bacterial cases, and local flurbiprofen offers rapid, short-term relief [^116NcnPh] [^116LRVB2].

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^112zVjz2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

### Antibiotics for treatment of sore throat in children and adults [^116NcnPh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care and to be prescribed antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics in primary medicine is a concern, hence it is important to establish their efficacy in treating sore throat and preventing secondary complications. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for reducing symptoms of sore throat for child and adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2021, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2021), Embase (January 1990 to April 2021), and two trial registries (searched 6 April 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications amongst children and adults seeking medical care for sore throat symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data, resolving any differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted the trial authors from three studies for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics on our primary outcomes (sore throat at day three and one week) and secondary outcomes (fever and headache symptoms and incidence of acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and quinsy).

Main Results

We included 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. The majority of included studies were conducted in the 1950s, during which time the rates of serious complications (especially acute rheumatic fever) were much higher than today. Although clinical antibiotic trials for sore throat and respiratory symptoms are still being conducted, it is unusual for them to include placebo or 'no treatment' control arms, which is a requirement for inclusion in the review. The age of participants ranged from younger than one year to older than 50 years, but most participants across all studies were adults. Although all studies recruited patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat, few of them distinguished between bacterial and viral aetiology. Bias may have been introduced through non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures and lack of blinding in some studies. Harms from antibiotics were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were thus not quantified for this review. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and headache at day three were reduced by using antibiotics, although 82% of participants in the placebo or no treatment group were symptom-free by one week. The reduction in sore throat symptoms at day three (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80; 16 studies, 3730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) was greater than at one week in absolute numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.75; 14 studies, 3083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) due to many cases in both treatment groups having resolved by this time. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 18. Compared with placebo or no treatment, antibiotics did not significantly reduce fever at day three (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; 8 studies, 1443 participants; high-certainty evidence), but did reduce headache at day three (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; 4 studies, 1020 participants; high-certainty evidence). 2. Suppurative complications Whilst the prevalence of suppurative complications was low, antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40; 10 studies, 3646 participants; high-certainty evidence) and quinsy within two months (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35; 8 studies, 2433 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those receiving placebo or no treatment, but not acute sinusitis within 14 days (Peto OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05; 8 studies, 2387 participants; high-certainty evidence). 3. Non-suppurative complications There were too few cases of acute glomerulonephritis to determine whether there was a protective effect of antibiotics compared with placebo against this complication (Peto OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 10 studies, 5147 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever within two months when compared to the control group (Peto OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; 18 studies, 12,249 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It should be noted that the overall prevalence of acute rheumatic fever was very low, particularly in the later studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat, and reduce the likelihood of headache, and some sore throat complications. As the effect on symptoms can be small, clinicians must judge on an individual basis whether it is clinically justifiable to use antibiotics to produce this effect, and whether the underlying cause of the sore throat is likely to be of bacterial origin. Furthermore, the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised. Few trials have attempted to measure symptom severity. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis. Additionally, more trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries, as well as in children.

### Antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat [^111igYye]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are sometimes used to prevent recurrent sore throat, despite concern about resistance. However, there is conflicting primary evidence regarding their effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in patients with recurrent sore throat.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics in adults and children suffering from pre-existing recurrent sore throat, defined as three or more sore throats in a year, examining the incidence of sore throat recurrence, with follow-up of at least 12 months post-antibiotic therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Multiple attempts to contact the authors of one study yielded no response.

Main Results

We identified no trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review. We discarded the majority of the references retrieved from our search following screening of the title and abstract. We formally excluded four studies following review of the full-text report.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat. This finding must be balanced against the known adverse effects and cost of antibiotic therapy, when considering antibiotics for this purpose. There is a need for high quality RCTs that compare the effects of antibiotics versus placebo in adults and children with pre-existing recurrent sore throat on the following outcomes: incidence of sore throat recurrence, adverse effects, days off work and absence from school, and the incidence of complications. Future studies should be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113jLX4r]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous evidence that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use on the basis that evidence was applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomised controlled trial included 565 patients presenting to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none of the patients initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to patient group: the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also seems to apply equally to patients with sore throat from group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and some with sore throat negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of the participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. Patients with less severe sore throat, however, will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition of one or two doses of steroids to the symptomatic management of sore throat is likely to appeal to many patients. More high quality data would be helpful to fully understand the net balance of benefits and harms according to severity of symptoms, particularly in primary care settings.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 2outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing adjunct steroids for sore throat, which are also accessible along with the evidence as decision aids to support shared decision-making in MAGICapp. Steroids are typically given as 10 mg dexamethasone (or adapted to weight for children: 0.6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg), typically taken as pill or intramuscular injection.

Fig2 Practical issues about use of corticosteroids to treat acute sore throat

The risks may outweigh the benefits when larger cumulative doses of corticosteroids are given to patients who experience multiple episodes of sore throat, either through multiple visits or for patients who self medicate if prescribed more than one pill for their previous episode. To mitigate this issue, clinicians should administer the medication in office if possible or prescribe only one dose per visit.

Costs and resources

The panel focused on the patient perspective rather than that of society when formulating the recommendation. Given the low cost of corticosteroids for treating sore throat, implementation of this recommendation is unlikely to have an important impact on the costs for health funders. The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be offered in the context of a consultation that would have taken place anyway. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether it may increase the proportion of patients visiting a doctor to get a prescription of corticosteroids.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113PdqbD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^114zT1Nb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to seek medical care. It is a disease that remits spontaneously, that is, 'cure' is not dependent on treatment. Nonetheless primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for sore throat and other upper respiratory tract infections.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics in the management of sore throat.

Search Strategy

Systematic search of the literature from 1945 to 2003, using electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2003), and the reference sections of the articles identified. We applied no language restrictions. We used abstracts of identified articles to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative complications (meaning: forming pus) and non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened potential studies for inclusion and resolved differences in opinion by discussion. The reviewers then independently extracted the data from the selected studies. We contacted the authors of three studies to acquire additional information not available in published articles. Potential studies were screened independently by two reviewers for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data was then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two reviewers. Authors of three studies were contacted to acquire additional information not available in published articles.

Main Results

We included twenty-six studies, covering 12,669 cases of sore throat in the review.1. Non-suppurative complications There was a trend for protection against acute glomerulonephritis by antibiotics, but insufficient cases were recorded to be sure of this effect. Several studies found that antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever, to less than one third (odds ratio (OR) = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20 to 0.45). 2. Suppurative complications Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media to about one quarter of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and reduced the incidence of acute sinusitis to about one half of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05). The incidence of quinsy was also reduced in relation to placebo group (OR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35). 3. Symptoms Symptoms of headache, throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics to about one half. The greatest time for this to be evident was at about three and a half days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). About 90% of treated and untreated patients were free of symptoms by one week. The overall number needed to treat to prevent one sore throat at day three was about 5.0 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8); and at one week was 14.2 (95% CI 11.5 to 20.6). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction Subgroup analysis by age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics yielded no significant differences. The results of swabs of the throat for Streptococcus influenced the effect of antibiotics. If the swab was positive, antibiotics were more effective (the OR reduced to 0.16, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26) than if it was negative (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can be achieved only by treating with antibiotics many who will derive no benefit. In emerging economies where rates of for example acute rheumatic fever are high, the number needed to treat may be much lower. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by a mean of one day about half way through the illness (the time of maximal effect), and by about sixteen hours overall.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114UkFCK]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is among the most common presenting complaints in both emergency departments and outpatient care settings. It is the cause of about 5% of medical visits in children and about 2% of all outpatient visits in adults. The most common cause of sore throat is acute pharyngitis caused by self limiting viral infections. Pain management with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therefore represents the mainstay of care. These drugs provide limited pain relief but also sometimes cause serious harm.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics also provides modest benefit in reduction of symptoms and fever when the infection is bacterial, but their use could contribute to antibiotic resistance. Although most cases of sore throat have a viral aetiology, and the risk of secondary complications is low, clinicians commonly prescribe antibiotics. Though this could be because clinicians think that patients seeking care expect a course of antibiotics, in reality pain relief might be more important to them.

Corticosteroids represent an additional therapeutic option for symptom relief. Randomised control trials suggest that a short course of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids probably provides symptomatic benefit to patients with sore throat. Despite this evidence, clinicians do not commonly use steroids. Reasons might include uncertain applicability of the evidence to patients with less severe disease, as the initial studies enrolled only patients with severe sore throat presenting to emergency departments, almost all of whom received antibiotics.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In this case, the stimulus was the recent TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial, which randomised over 500 patients with sore throat presenting to their primary care clinician who were not initially prescribed antibiotics; the TOAST authors reported beneficial effects of corticosteroids. In the light of this new potentially practice changing evidence, we updated the latest Cochrane reviewdealing with the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^1156fVtp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care. Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat for patients in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6, MEDLINE (January 1966 to July week 1, 2013) and EMBASE (January 1990 to July 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted trial authors from three studies for additional information.

Main Results

We included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. We did not identify any new trials in this 2013 update. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and fever were reduced by about half by using antibiotics. The greatest difference was seen at day three. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 21. 2. Non-suppurative complications The trend was antibiotics protecting against acute glomerulonephritis but there were too few cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds within one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.60). 3. Suppurative complications Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); acute sinusitis within 14 days (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and quinsy within two months (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) compared to those taking placebo. 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction Antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day three (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if throat swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97 if negative. Similarly at week one the RR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative Streptococcus swabs.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in high-income countries requires treating many with antibiotics for one to benefit. This NNTB may be lower in low-income countries. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 16 hours overall.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hGcVz]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations for research

Future trials should be in antibiotic naïve patients, and include the number of patients who have resolution of symptoms at 24, 48, and 72 hours and standardised pain scores. They should be large enough to adequately assess adverse events and days missed from school or work. Use of the Centor criteria at baseline will facilitate classification of severity. Any effects of corticosteroids on potentially reducing antibiotic use will need to be balanced by the risk of medicalising what is usually a self limiting and short lasting infection. Further research should focus on the effects of corticosteroids on antibiotic use as well as longer term measures such as reattendance with recurrent sore throats. Additionally, further trials in children are warranted that adequately report the outcome measures outlined above.

Summary

Corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat. In the current analysis, most participants had severe or exudative sore throat. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences between trials, including severe sore throats and those in which severity was not stated. We found no evidence of significant benefit in children. Further research should target corticosteroid use in antibiotic-naïve patients.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (−0.4 to −21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.

Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^115Dt7We]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to present for medical care. Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (January 1990 to December 2005).

Selection Criteria

Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative or non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

Data Collection and Analysis

Potential studies were screened independently by two authors for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data were then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two authors. Researchers from three studies were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

There were 27 studies with 2835 cases of sore throat. 1. Non-suppurative complications: There was a trend for antibiotics to protect against acute glomerulonephritis, but there were insufficient cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two thirds (relative risk (RR) 0.22; 95% CI 0.02 to 2.08). 2. Suppurative complications: Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); of acute sinusitis (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) compared to those taking placebo (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47). 3.

Symptoms

Throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics by about one half. The greatest difference was seen at about 3 to 4 days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). By one week about 90% of treated and untreated patients were symptom-free. The overall number need to treat to prevent one sore throat at day 3 was just under six (95% CI 4.9 to 7.0); at week 1 it was 21 (95% CI 13.2 to 47.9). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction: Analysis by: age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics, found no significant differences. Analysis of results of throat swabs showed that antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day 3, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if the swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) if negative. Similarly at week 1, RRs 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive, and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative swabs.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can only be achieved by treating many with antibiotics, most of whom will derive no benefit. In emerging economies (where rates of acute rheumatic fever are high, for example), the number needed to treat may be much lower for antibiotics to be considered effective. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about sixteen hours overall.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TxTbJ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^117UqnmX]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Effect of oral dexamethasone without immediate antibiotics vs placebo on acute sore throat in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^115Jhqxu]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute sore throat poses a significant burden on primary care and is a source of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Corticosteroids could be an alternative symptomatic treatment.

Objective

To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral corticosteroids for acute sore throat in the absence of antibiotics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (April 2013-February 2015; 28-day follow-up completed April 2015) conducted in 42 family practices in South and West England, enrolled 576 adults recruited on the day of presentation to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy.

Interventions

Single oral dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone (n = 293) or identical placebo (n = 283).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary: proportion of participants experiencing complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. Secondary: complete resolution at 48 hours, duration of moderately bad symptoms (based on a Likert scale, 0, normal; 6, as bad as it could be), visual analog symptom scales (0–100 mm; 0, no symptom to 100, worst imaginable), health care attendance, days missed from work or education, consumption of delayed antibiotics or other medications, adverse events.

Results

Among 565 eligible participants who were randomized (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 26.0–45.5 year]; 75.2% women; 100% completed the intervention), 288 received dexamethasone; 277, placebo. At 24 hours, 65 participants (22.6%) in the dexamethasone group and 49 (17.7%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 4.7% (95% CI, -1.8% to 11.2%) and a relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI; 0.92 to 1.78; P = 0.14). At 24 hours, participants receiving dexamethasone were not more likely than those receiving placebo to have complete symptom resolution. At 48 hours, 102 participants (35.4%) in the dexamethasone group vs 75 (27.1%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 8.7% (95% CI, 1.2% to 16.2%) and a relative risk of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68; P = 0.03). This difference also was observed in participants not offered delayed antibiotic prescription, for a risk difference of 10.3% (95% CI, 0.6% to 20.1%) and a relative risk of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults presenting to primary care with acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone compared with placebo did not increase the proportion of patients with resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. However, there was a significant difference at 48 hours.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^1174zw4c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3–4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0–2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

Details for This Review Study Population: Children and adults seeking medical care for symptoms of sore throat 1 Efficacy End Points: Sore throat at day 3 and one week, fever at day 3, headache at day 3, rheumatic fever within two months, glomerulonephritis within one month, peritonsillar abscess within two months, acute otitis media within 14 days, and acute sinusitis within 14 days. Harm End Points: Because of poor or inconsistent reporting, no harm end points were quantified for this review. 2, 3 This Cochrane review provides an updated look at the effect of antibiotics in patients presenting with a sore throat.

1. A total of 29 randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials were selected, including 15, 337 cases of sore throat overall. Children and adults were included.

Studies examined different formulations, dosing regimens, and dosing routes of penicillin, chlortetracycline, cefixime, sulfanilamide, sulfamerazine/sulfadiazine/sulfathiazole, amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin. The systematic review and meta-analysis showed that, compared with no treatment or placebo, antibiotics were effective at resolving sore throat at day 3 and at one week. In a subgroup analysis evaluating sore throat resolution at day 3 of antibiotic treatment, the RR of throat pain was 0. 58 in those who were positive, compared with
0. 78 in those who were negative, suggesting that prescribing antibiotics is more beneficial for patients with sore throats caused by group A streptococci. However, the effect of group A streptococci testing on suppurative and nonsuppurative complications was not reported.

### Antibiotics for sore throat… [^116BCMbn]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should we prescribe antibiotics for sore throat. Evidence-Based Answer Compared with placebo, antibiotics can shorten the duration of sore throat symptoms by about 16 hours and can reduce complications. In countries where the absolute rates of complications are higher, antibiotic therapy is more likely to be effective. The effectiveness of antibiotic therapy is greatest in persons with streptococcal pharyngitis. In this Cochrane review, the authors identified 27 studies comparing antibiotics with placebo. They examined the effect on symptom duration, the likelihood of clinical response, and the likelihood of secondary outcomes such as headache, acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, peritonsillar abscess, acute otitis media, and acute sinusitis. They found a mean 16-hour reduction in sore throat symptoms treated with antibiotics.

Symptom resolution after three days was greatest in persons who were culture positive for group A streptococcus, yet antibiotics also modestly benefited patients who were culture negative and those who were never tested. Although these data are compelling, the dates of the studies included in the review should be considered. Most were conducted before 1975, when there were much higher rates of secondary complications, making the benefits of antibiotics seem more dramatic. As an example, the review found that the incidence of acute otitis media as a secondary complication of sore throat was 3% before 1975, compared with 0. 7% in
2013. This difference increases the NNT from 50 to nearly 200 to prevent a single case of acute otitis media.

This systematic review found a modest reduction in the duration of sore throat symptoms and complications with antibiotic treatment, even among patients who had a negative culture for streptococcus. However, the impact on complications in contemporary developed nations is much smaller. Some patients who had a negative culture for group A streptococcus might have had group C streptococcus or may have had a false-negative culture. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that confirmed cases of streptococcal pharyngitis be treated with an appropriately selected antibiotic for a duration sufficient to eliminate the infection. 3.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

On publication of this Practice paper (BMJ 2017;358:j4090, doi:), the main graphical summary of the evidence for this recommendation contained an error. For the outcome "Complete pain resolution (48 hrs)", the value of 608 people per 1000 (183 more) was stated for those people taking steroids. The correct value should have been 629 per 1000 (204 more), as stated in the systematic review supporting the recommendation. This error has been corrected in the graphical summary.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vXs8j]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for about one in 50 of all ambulatory care visits and resulting in considerable costs. Most sore throats are self limitingand are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus is responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15–30% of those in children.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics provides only modest beneficial effect in reducing symptoms and fever. 7 8 However, prescribing rates remain disproportionately high. High rates of antibiotic prescriptions contribute to antibiotic resistanceand also lead to the "medicalising" of sore throat, which can result in increased rates of patient (re)attendance. In developed countries, prescribing is no longer justified to prevent complications from group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Peritonsillar abscess occurs in fewer than two in 10 000 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections, whereas non-suppurative complications (such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis) are extremely rare.

The pressure for clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat leaves a therapeutic vacuum. Corticosteroids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators in human airway endothelial cells which cause pharyngeal inflammation and ultimately symptoms of pain. Corticosteroids are beneficial in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis, croup, and infectious mononucleosis. We therefore hypothesised that corticosteroids would offer similar symptomatic relief from sore throat because of their anti-inflammatory effects, and undertook a systematic review to examine the effect of systemic corticosteroids on adults and children with sore throat.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat [^111CL5WR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used to treat sore throat in China and among Chinese people worldwide. Their efficacy in treating sore throat has not previously been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for patients with sore throat.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; MEDLINE (1966 to August 2006); EMBASE (1980 to August 2006); AMED (1985 to August 2006); the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1975 to August 2006), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to August 2006).

Selection Criteria

We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of sore throat with the outcomes of recovery, inefficacy, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author contacted the trial authors of claimed RCTs. Three review authors extracted and analysed the data.

Main Results

Seven trials involving 1253 participants were included. All trials were identified as being of methodologically poor quality (C category). All of the Chinese herbal preparations in this review were inadequately characterised and were assessed in one trial only. It is highly likely that there was selection bias or detection bias, or both, in all of the included trials. Conflict of interest may have been another factor in producing a positive result in three studies as the prepared drugs were made in the trial author's hospital. We did not perform a meta-analysis and the results of the studies are reported separately. Three formulations were shown to be superior to the control in improving recovery: Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye for acute pharyngitis (OR 1.54, 95% Cl 1.11 to 5.74); Yanhouling mixture was more effective than the gentamicin atomised inhalation for acute pharyngitis (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.69 to 10.81) for acute pharyngitis; and Qinganlan Liyan Hanpian was more effective than Fufang Caoshanhu Hanpian for chronic pharyngitis (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.67). Four four formulations were shown to be equal in efficacy to the control.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the existing evidence included in this review, the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine for treating sore throat is controversial and questionable. We cannot recommend any kind of Chinese medical herbal formulation as an effective remedy for sore throat, due to the lack of high quality clinical trials.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111SM6Ga]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment

Reviewers extracted the following data, independently and in duplicate: general study information (authors, publication year, and study location); study population details (sample size, age, diagnosis, and percentage of participants with confirmed group A β haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis or culture positive for bacterial pathogens); setting (primary care versus hospital emergency department); details on the intervention and comparison (for example, type, form, duration, and dose of corticosteroids; type of control group); co-interventions (proportion of participants who received antibiotics and/or analgesics); and outcomes as listed above.

In randomised controlled trials with more than two arms, we extracted data from the arm closest to a single dose regimen or data from the arm that received corticosteroid as adjunct treatment to standard of care rather than instead of standard of care. In trials with data for both oral and parenteral corticosteroids, we used oral data for the main analysis and intramuscular data for the appropriate subgroup analysis.

Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the modified Cochrane risk of bias instrument, which deals with random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of study participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and other potential sources of bias. Reviewers classified studies at high risk of bias when they had rated at least one item as high risk of bias.

To assess the quality of evidence, we used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach that classifies evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality based on considerations of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias. We resolved disagreements between reviewers in data extraction and assessments of risk of bias or quality of evidence by discussion and, if needed, by third party adjudication. We used the MAGICapp platform to generate the GRADE summary of findings table.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NZKzB]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of "sore throat" (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

We searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy. Terms used included "upper respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "tonsillitis", "sore throat", and "corticosteroids" (including "dexamethasone", "betamethasone", "prednisone", and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat [^115T5NYB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used to treat sore throat in China and are used worldwide by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Their efficacy in treating sore throat has not previously been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for patients with sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to week 3, November 2011); EMBASE (1980 to December 2011); AMED (1985 to December 2011); the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1975 to December 2011); and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to December 2011).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trial (RCTs) assessing Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of sore throat, with the outcomes of recovery, inefficacy, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

The three review authors extracted and analysed the data. One review author contacted the study authors of potential RCTs.

Main Results

We included 12 studies involving 1954 participants. We identified ten studies as being of methodologically poor quality and two studies as being of medium quality. We did not perform a meta-analysis but reported the results separately. Six formulations were shown to be superior to the control in improving recovery: Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye for acute pharyngitis (odds ratio (OR) 2.52; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.11 to 5.74); Yanhouling mixture was more effective than gentamicin atomised inhalation for acute pharyngitis (OR 5.39; 95% CI 2.69 to 10.81); Qinganlan Liyan Hanpian was more effective than Fufang Caoshanhu Hanpian for acute pharyngitis (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.67); sore throat capsules were more effective than antibiotics (intravenous cefalexin) for acute pharyngitis or acute tonsillitis (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.51); compound dandelion soup was more effective than sodium penicillin for acute purulent tonsillitis (OR 5.06; 95% CI 1.70 to 15.05); and eliminating heat by nourishing yin and relieving sore-throat methods combined with Dikuiluqan Hanpian was more effective than Dikuiluqan Hanpian alone for children with chronic pharyngitis (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.02 to 6.79). Another six formulations were shown to be equally efficacious as the control.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the existing evidence in this review, some Chinese herbal medicines for treating sore throat appeared efficacious. However, due to the lack of high quality clinical trials, the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine for treating sore throat is controversial and questionable. Therefore we cannot recommend any kind of Chinese medical herbal formulation as an effective remedy for sore throat.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PdY73]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Corticosteroids significantly increase the proportion of patients with sore throat who will experience complete resolution of pain at both 24 and 48 hours. Fewer than four patients need to be treated to prevent one patient continuing to experience a painful sore throat at 24 hours. Although corticosteroids decreased the mean time to onset of pain relief by 6 hours, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity. All effects were in addition to antibiotic use.

We found that the effects of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief were homogenous in severe, exudative, or bacterial pathogen positive sore throat alone. Our data do not support an effect in mild sore throat because only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline, and showed no significant effect. A meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of interactions across different subgroups (such as route of corticosteroid, age, severity) on the outcome of mean time to onset of pain relief.

The effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours, which implies that a single dose of corticosteroids may be sufficient. This effect is similar to that seen in croup where a single dose is generally adequate. Furthermore, the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect. w2

Study selection

Reviewers (BS, RACS, DP, RBP) independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the samereviewersindependently assessed eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with standard of care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

We excluded studies of participants who were admitted to hospital or immunocompromised and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. We also excluded studies that enrolled children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self reported pain.

Our outcomes of interest were complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours; mean time to onset of pain relief; mean time to complete resolution of pain; absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours; duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms (such as problems for eating, drinking, swallowing); recurrence/relapse of symptoms; days missed from school or work; need for antibiotics; and rate of adverse events related to treatment. We included any adverse events reported by the authors.

Objective To evaluate whether systemic corticosteroids improve symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), NHS Health Economics Database, and bibliographies.

Outcome measures Percentage of patients with complete resolution at 24 and 48 hours, mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of symptoms, days missed from work or school, recurrence, and adverse events.

Results We included eight trials, consisting of 743 patients in total (369 children, 374 adults). 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. In addition to antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids significantly increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (four trials) by more than three times (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1), and at 48 hours (three trials) to a lesser extent (1.7, 1.3 to 2.1). Corticosteroids (six trials) reduced mean time to onset of pain relief by more than 6 hours (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 9.3, P < 0.001), although significant heterogeneity was present. The mean time to complete resolution was inconsistent across trials and a pooled analysis was not undertaken. Reporting of other outcomes was limited.

Conclusions Corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat, in addition to antibiotic therapy, mainly in participants with severe or exudative sore throat.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^117K3jjR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

Pain

In the five randomised controlled trials that reported complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours, patients who received a single dose of corticosteroids were twice as likely to experience complete symptom resolution than placebo patients (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 4.29; I² = 69%, 22.4% v 10.0%; moderate quality evidence; fig 2, table 2). All studies reporting this outcome were at low risk of bias. Tests of interaction showed no evidence of any subgroup effect (table A in appendix 3).

In the eight studies that reported mean time to onset of pain relief, patients who received corticosteroids experienced onset of pain relief on average 4.8 hours earlier than those who received placebo (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; I² = 78%; moderate quality; fig 4, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table A in appendix 3).

### Effect of oral dexamethasone without immediate antibiotics vs placebo on acute sore throat in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113WdPLd]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study TOAST was published by Gail Nicola Hayward and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. In the TOAST study, the trial question was: what is the effect of oral dexamethasone in adult patients with acute sore throat? In the TOAST study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOAST study, the population was: 565 patients (425 female, 140 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients presenting to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy. The key exclusion criteria were recent use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids or antibiotics; recent adenotonsillectomy; a clear alternative diagnosis. In the TOAST study, the interventions were: n = 288 dexamethasone (a single oral dose of 10 mg) n = 277 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOAST study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in complete resolution of symptoms within 24 hours (22.6% vs. 17.7%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78). In the TOAST study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in complete resolution of symptoms within 48 hours (35.4% vs. 27.1%; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.68) No significant difference in median time to onset of pain relief (27.5 hours vs. 27 hours; HR 1.106, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.44) No significant difference in median time to complete symptom resolution (65.8 hours vs. 60 hours; HR 1.043, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.39). In the TOAST study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the TOAST study, the conclusion was: in adult patients presenting to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy, dexamethasone was not superior to placebo with respect to complete resolution of symptoms within 24 hours.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^116LRVB2]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Low dose (8.75 mg), locally administered flurbiprofen has been shown in the reviewed studies to provide effective relief of acute sore throat, including relief of throat pain and soreness, difficulty swallowing, sensation of swollen throat, and many other commonly reported qualities of sore throat. This efficacy has been demonstrated across all the different locally administered formulations studied (lozenge, spray or microgranules), providing patients and HCPs with the option to select the most appropriate formulation for the individual without compromising on efficacy. Moreover, data have demonstrated that flurbiprofen is effective even in patients with more severe or painful symptoms, who are more likely to visit their doctor and more likely to take antibiotics. Although these patients with more severe symptoms might be expected to be more resilient to the pharmacological effects of low dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects were actually similar or more pronounced in these patients compared with the overall study population.

The reviewed studies confirm the fast onset of symptomatic relief with flurbiprofen, beginning as early as 1–2 min post-dose. The demulcent activity of lozenges provides a rapid soothing effect ("active placebo") as soon as they are sucked and allows a high initial deposition of active ingredient in the mouth and throat. The spray formulation delivers a full dose immediately at the site of pain and inflammation, coating the posterior pharynx. This early onset of relief was most apparent in studies that employed a short time interval between assessments (eg 2 min), and initial assessment within 1–2 min after flurbiprofen administration. The data reviewed also demonstrate that "clinically meaningful" relief attributable to the anti-inflammatory effects of flurbiprofen occurs rapidly (from around 12 min post-dose)and is sustained for up to 4–6 h (the last time point assessed after a single dose).

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^117Dhz7v]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Guidelines recommend symptomatic management of pharyngitis as a first-line treatment, and suggest avoiding or delaying antibiotic use in acute pharyngitis, except in the minority of patients with more severe strep infection or risk factors for serious complications such as rheumatic fever. The availability of rapid and effective symptomatic relief is, therefore, an important factor in meeting patients' expectations and avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics; most cases of pharyngitis can be managed by patients using over-the-counter (OTC) treatments as a means of controlling their symptoms. As inflammation is the underlying cause of pharyngitis, treatment of the condition with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can offer rapid and long-lasting relief from pain.

To minimize the potential risk of an adverse event, regulatory bodies and medical societies recommend using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms. Locally administered formulations of NSAIDs, such as lozenges and sprays, facilitate targeted application of active ingredient to the throat, allowing absorption of the drug directly where it is needed. This allows administration of a lower dose than systemic therapy, reducing the potential for adverse effects. Flurbiprofen is an NSAID that has been formulated for local delivery at a low dose and is commercially available as a single active ingredient in both lozenge and spray formulations. It is most commonly used at a dose of 8.75 mg, based on the results of a dose-ranging study that demonstrated linear dose–response relationships for effectiveness and adverse events at doses between 5.0 mg and 12.5 mg. Its use for the symptomatic relief of pharyngitis of viral, bacterial, or unknown etiology has been assessed in a number of studies. It has also been evaluated for the relief of postoperative sore throat POST,–a common complication of general anesthesiaand tonsillectomythat can negatively impact patients' postoperative comfort.

The aim of this paper is to review the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat. This review predominantly focuses on the management of sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI); its use for POST prevention is discussed in brief.

Results

Description of included studies

We identified 2349 titles and abstracts through our literature search, of which 46 were potentially eligible and 36 were excluded (19 were not randomised trials; 14 had no patients with sore throat/acute pharyngitis; in three corticosteroids were not among the interventions or were not compared with a placebo/usual care). Figure 1shows the details of study selection process.

Fig 1 Selection of studies in review of corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat

The 10 randomised controlled trials that proved eligible enrolled 1426 individuals. Eight studies recruited patients from hospital emergency departmentsand two from primary care. Three studies enrolled children, six studies enrolled adults, and one study included both children and adults. Oral dexamethasone (single dose of 10 mg for adults and 0.6 mg/kg, maximum 10 mg for children) was the most common intervention (five studies) followed by single dose intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (three studies). All patients in three trials received both antibiotics and analgesics as the usual care; in two trials, all patients received antibiotics, while analgesics were prescribed at the physician's discretion. In the five remaining trials, patients in usual care group received antibiotics or analgesics at the physician's discretion. Table 1presents study details.

Fig 4 Weighted mean difference in mean time to onset of pain relief (hours) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference was calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

Time to complete resolution of pain was reported in six studies. On average, patients receiving a single dose corticosteroid experienced complete resolution 11.1 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −0.4 to −21.8; I² = 85%; low quality; fig 5, table 2). In our subgroup analysis, we found a significantly larger effect among those treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (mean difference −22.4 (95% confidence interval −27.3 to −17.5) and −1.5 (−12.6 to 9.5), for intramuscular and oral corticosteroids, respectively; P = 0.001 for interaction); however, the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies. We found no other subgroup effect (table B in appendix 3).

Meta-analysis from eight studies that assessed pain with a visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at baseline and after 24 hoursshowed a 1.3 points lower pain score among patients treated with corticosteroids compared with those treated with placebo at 24 hours (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; I² = 65%; moderate quality; fig 6, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table B in appendix 3).

Fig 6 Weighted mean difference in absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours (0–10; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

To assess the possibility that there was selective reporting, we examined the magnitude of effect on the time to onset of pain relief, time to complete resolution of pain, and absolute pain reduction in studies that did and did not report resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours. The magnitude of effect on the other pain outcomes was similar in both sets of studies, making selective reporting less likely (table C in appendix 3).

### Ear acupuncture for acute sore throat: a randomized controlled trial [^111PPxim]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common cause of pain in outpatient encounters. Battlefield auricular acupuncture (the placing of needles in specific points in the ear) is a modality used to treat acute pain associated with a variety of ailments. The aim of our study was to determine whether auricular acupuncture reduces pain, medication usage, and missed work hours when added to standard therapy in adult patients with acute sore throat.

Methods

We conducted an unblinded, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial among adult, nonpregnant patients presenting to an Air Force family medicine clinic with pain from acute sore throat. A total of 54 patients were followed for 48 hours after treatment.

Results

Patients receiving auricular acupuncture reported lower pain scores than those who did not at 15 minutes (6.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4–6.6] vs 2.6 [95% CI, 1.7–3.5]; P < .0001), 6 hours (4.8 [95% CI, 4.0–5.6] vs 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.4]; P = 0.0005), and 24 hours (4.1 [95% CI, 3.3–4.9] vs 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0–2.8]; P = 0.0006). They also reported taking fewer cumulative doses of pain medication at 6 hours (1.07 [95% CI, 0.69–1.45] vs 0.39 [95% CI, 0.2–0.58]; P = 0.003), 24 hours (2.63 [95% CI, 1.95–3.31] vs 1.37 [95% CI, 0.92–1.82]; P = 0.004), and 48 hours (4.07 [95% CI, 2.9–5.24] vs 2.19 [95% CI, 1.44–2.94]; P = 0.009). There was no difference in time missed from work between the auricular acupuncture and standard therapy groups.

Conclusions

Compared with usual treatment, battlefield auricular acupuncture was associated with reduced sore throat pain for 24 hours and decreased use of pain medication for up to 48 hours. There was no apparent effect on hours missed from work.

CONCLUSIONS

Our analysis shows that, among the 6 topical medications studied, lidocaine is not recommended for topical use in the prevention of POST. Glycyrrhizin, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and NMDA receptor antagonists are associated with the reduced postoperative pharyngeal pain across the 4 postsurgical time intervals examined. These treatments can be selected depending on the clinical experience of the anesthesiologists or the patient values and preferences for the reduction of postoperative throat pain.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^112wso9o]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses, and therefore inappropriate for up to 80% of pharyngitis cases, antibiotic prescribing for this condition remains commonplace in primary care. Current treatment guidelines advocate symptomatic relief of sore throat as first-line treatment; even in bacterial sore throat, antibiotics do not provide immediate or useful relief of symptoms, with half of patients still experiencing pain after 3 days. Moreover, physicians face considerable challenges in the accurate diagnosis of bacterial sore throat, with misdiagnosis potentially leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic resistance. Shephard et al highlighted the unreliability of strep A diagnosis based on clinical findings, with an 86.9% false positive result for strep A based on diagnosis by clinical features alone. Even using a rapid strep test, the study suggested that 23.9% of patients would have received antibiotics unnecessarily. Given its proven efficacy at providing fast and long-lasting relief from sore throat, particularly in the first few days when symptoms are worst, flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute sore throat, thus helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Studies confirm the efficacy of flurbiprofen in patients both with and without strep sore throat, although the analyses included in this review are limited by the relatively low incidence of strep A/C positive patients. As most strep sore throats will resolve naturally over time, flurbiprofen can be considered prior to a definitive diagnosis of strep A/C; with the single-dose effects lasting for 3–4 h in these patients, it is reassuring that more persistent, severe or worsening symptoms associated with strep throat are unlikely to be "masked", allowing patients to seek further advice and potentially antibiotics if required. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics may be warranted, flurbiprofen can be safely combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms that antibiotics will not immediately alleviate.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^114uv9nq]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed to many people with sore throat. As most cases of sore throat are viral and/or self-limiting, guidelines recommend symptomatic management as first-line treatment. This paper reviews the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat.

Method

A literature search was performed on 27 February 2019 using PubMed. Studies that met the following criteria were included in a narrative review: (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness of flurbiprofen for pharyngitis/sore throat; (2) randomized controlled studies; (3) locally administered formulation of study drug/comparator; and (4) flurbiprofen administered at 8.75 mg dose (single- or multiple-dose administration).

Results

A total of 17 papers were included in the review: 15 publications reporting data from nine unique clinical studies of flurbiprofen for acute pharyngitis, and two reporting studies of flurbiprofen for the prevention of postoperative sore throat (POST). Studies in acute pharyngitis demonstrated that single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg, locally administered in lozenge, spray or microgranule form, was well tolerated and provided early onset and long-lasting symptomatic relief from throat pain and soreness, sensation of swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, and other associated symptoms. This included patients with more severe symptoms, patients with confirmed Streptococcus A/C sore throat, and patients taking concomitant antibiotics. In addition, a single preoperative dose of flurbiprofen lozenge was shown to be effective for relieving early POST in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Conclusion

Locally administered, low-dose flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute pharyngitis/sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection, thus potentially helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. It also offers an effective preoperative treatment option for the reduction of early POST severity and incidence.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111moPNu]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

Our analysis had some limitations. Firstly, and most importantly, all of the included trials provided antibiotics to patients in both corticosteroid and placebo groups (either to all participants, or to all participants with group A β-haemolytic streptococcus culture or a positive rapid antigen test). Therefore, we do not know the effects of corticosteroids on sore throat symptoms independent of antibiotics.

Secondly, various outcome measures were reported, in some cases with inadequate reporting, no standard deviations, or use of graphical representation only. Thirdly, significant heterogeneity occurred in some of our analyses; this was attributable mainly to one trial, w7 which demonstrated increased benefit of corticosteroids with small standard deviations. However, our results remained robust to the removal of this trial.

Fourthly, the outcome measure of mean time to onset of pain relief was limited by recall bias, because the estimation of the time when pain relief begins relies on patients' subjective recall and recording. The mean time could also be skewed by a few participants who had sore throat pain for especially long or short periods. A median time may have been more appropriate, although there were insufficient data for us to calculate this.

Finally, the limited number of trials meant that we were unable to assess publication bias using funnel plots, although we attempted to address this issue by using citation searching. Included studies were also underpowered to detect rare adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy, as well as relapse rates and days missed from work or school.

Conclusion

Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge provides effective relief from the pain associated with sore throats due to URTI. Non-inferiority of the spray versus the lozenge formulation was established, and both formulations demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety profiles. The spray and lozenge formulations offer patients two different treatment formats to choose from for effective symptomatic relief of sore throat, depending on their own preferences.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data using an extraction template. Disagreements were documented and resolved by discussion with a third author. We assessed methodological quality of studies by allocation concealment, randomisation, comparability of groups on baseline characteristics, blinding, treatment adherence, and percentage participation.

Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants with improvement or complete resolution of symptoms, mean times to onset of pain relief, and complete resolution of pain. Secondary outcomes included the reduction in pain measured by visual analogue scale, adverse events necessitating discontinuation of treatment, relapse rates, and days missed from school or work. Where necessary, data were extracted from graphs with the Grab It XP Microsoft Excel program

We did sensitivity analyses, excluding each study in turn, to determine the stability of the effect. A priori subgroup analyses included age, route of corticosteroid, presence of positive bacterial culture or direct antigen test, and severity of sore throat including presence of exudate. Meta-regression in STATA tested subgroup interaction on the outcomes. We selected the data closest to a single-dose regimen from those studies that used different dosing regimens in a single trial as our conservative strategy. Similarly, if both oral and intramuscular data were available, we used oral data for our overall analysis and intramuscular data for appropriate subgroup analysis.

Data synthesis and analysis

We expressed dichotomous outcomes as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and expressed continuous variables as weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. If data were sufficient for primary outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat using the relative risk and the pooled event rates, in addition to the risk difference as calculated in RevMan 4.2. We used the I² statistic to measure the proportion of statistical heterogeneity for each outcome. Where no heterogeneity was present, we undertook a fixed effect meta-analysis. If substantial heterogeneity (I² above 50%) was detected, we looked for the direction of effect and where applicable used a random effects analysis. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by removing single trials to investigate the extent to which they contributed to the heterogeneity, particularly looking at baseline characteristics including severity.

### Comparative efficacy of 6 topical pharmacological agents for preventive interventions of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116UDZ7z]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical pharmacological agents typically used to treat postoperative sore throat (POST) after tracheal intubation include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, lidocaine, Glycyrrhiza (licorice), and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (including ketamine and magnesium). However, the optimal prophylactic drug remains elusive.

Methods

The literature published before September 8, 2019 was searched on the PubMed, the Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering topical prophylactic medications for patients with POST were included. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the quality of evidence. The primary outcome is the risk of POST. Combining both direct and indirect evidence, a network meta-analysis was performed to assess odds ratios (ORs) between the topical pharmacological agents and surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve for the treatment-based outcomes. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020158985.

Results

Sixty-two RCTs (at least 73% of which were double blinded) that included a total of 6708 subjects and compared 6 categories of drugs and/or placebos were ultimately enrolled. All preventive interventions except lidocaine were more effective than placebo at the 4 time intervals. Lidocaine (OR: 0.35, 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.16–0.79) has a greater POST preventative intervention effect than the placebo at a time interval of only 2 to 3 hours after surgery. Relative to lidocaine, the risk of POST except 2 to 3 hours was lower for the following treatments: corticosteroids, ketamine, magnesium, NSAIDs, and Glycyrrhiza. The NMDA receptor antagonists studied here included ketamine and magnesium. Magnesium generally demonstrated greater benefit than ketamine at 24 hours postsurgery/extubation (OR: 0.41, 95% CrI, 0.18–0.92). Compared with ketamine, corticosteroids were associated with a reduced risk of POST during the 4 to 6 hours (OR: 0.40, 95% CrI, 0.19–0.83) and 24 hours (OR: 0.34, 95% CrI, 0.16–0.72) time intervals. During the 2 to 3 hours time interval, Glycyrrhiza (OR: 0.38, 95% CrI, 0.15–0.97) was more efficacious than magnesium.

Conclusions

Our analysis shows that, among the 6 topical medications studied, lidocaine is not optimal for topical use to prevent POST. Glycyrrhizin, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and NMDA receptor antagonists (ketamine and magnesium) are associated with a reduced postoperative pharyngeal pain across the 4 postsurgical time intervals studied, all of which can be chosen according to the clinical experience of the anesthesiologists and the patient preferences and are recommended for the reduction of postoperative throat pain.

Five trials assessed the mean time to complete resolution of pain. w3-w5 w7 w8 High heterogeneity prevented pooling: three studies showed a benefit of corticosteroids, w5 w7 w8 and two showed non-significant effects in opposing directions. Time to complete resolution ranged from 15 to 45 hours in the corticosteroid group and 35 to 54 hours in the placebo group.

Adverse events, relapse rates, and days missed from school or work

Only one trial w5 of 125 participants reported adverse events: five patients (three steroid, two placebo) were hospitalised for fluid rehydration, and three patients developed peritonsillar abscess (one steroid, two placebo). Three studies reported no significant differences in days missed from school or work. w1 w2 w4 Four trials reported no difference in the incidence of recurrent symptoms w1-w4 (measured between 5 days and 1 month after treatment), whereas one trial found significantly increased recurrence in the placebo group. w6

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^115YuUem]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a lozenge or spray provides relief for the pain associated with sore throat due to URTI, giving patients two different treatment formats to choose from according to their own preferences. Patients may, for example, prefer the demulcent effects of a lozenge or the convenience of a spray. Advantages of a spray include delivery of a full dose immediately at the site of pain and inflammation, whereas lozenges take time to dissolve in the mouth (~3–5 minutes) in order to deliver a full dose. A patient's choice of treatment format may also depend on the time of day they require relief.

Throat swab culture results from our study showed that only a small proportion of patients had beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C), indicating that antibiotics would have been inappropriate for the majority of participants. Many patients who hope or ask for antibiotics may, in fact, be seeking treatment to alleviate pain; however, findings from a systematic review showed that antibiotics are among the least effective treatments for symptomatic relief of sore throat. In contrast, symptomatic treatments such as NSAIDs and analgesics were found to be up to 93% more effective than placebo. Together with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, these findings suggest that non-antibiotic treatments should be considered instead of antibiotics for relieving sore throat symptoms. Importantly, in our study, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge provided comparable pain relief in patients both with and without beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C) infection. Both formulations may therefore represent an alternative and preferable first-line treatment for patients with acute sore throat without any of the "red flags" that might indicate a more serious illness. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics are warranted, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray or lozenge could be combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms.

### Are sore throat patients who hope for antibiotics actually asking for pain relief? [^116cBcgx]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Antibiotics are still overprescribed for self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sore throat, and physicians mention patient's desire for antibiotics as a driving force. We studied patients' concerns when visiting their family physician for acute sore throat, more specifically the importance they attach to antibiotic treatment and pain relief.

Methods

Family physicians in 6 peer groups in Belgium participated in an observational postvisit questionnaire survey. Patients aged 12 years and older making an office visit for acute sore throat were invited to indicate the importance of different reasons for the visit.

Results

Sixty-eight family physicians provided data from 298 patients. The 3 most frequently endorsed reasons for visiting the physician were examination to establish the cause of the symptoms, pain relief, and information on the course of the disease. Hopes for an antibiotic ranked 11th of 13 items. Patients who considered antibiotics very/rather important valued pain relief significantly more than patients who considered them little/not important (P < .001). Patients who hoped for antibiotics felt more unwell (P < .001), had more faith in antibiotics to speed recovery (P < .001), and were less convinced that sore throat was a self-limiting disease (P < .012). A multivariate model, adjusted for age, sex, and educational status, showed that the desire for pain relief is a strong predictor of the hope to receive a prescription for antibiotics.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that patients with acute sore throat and who hope for antibiotics may in fact want treatment for pain. Trials are needed to test whether exploring patients' expectations about pain management and offering adequate analgesia can assist physicians in managing sore throats without prescribing antibiotics.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^116Fgr84]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Local therapies, such as lozenges and sprays, are useful for the symptomatic treatment of sore throats as they allow direct application to the inflamed and painful area, with a reduced risk of toxicity when compared with systemic treatments. Lozenges allow a high initial deposition of active ingredient in the mouth and throat, while sprays are effective in coating the posterior pharynxfor rapid delivery to the affected area.

Flurbiprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with proven analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and lozenges containing 8.75 mg flurbiprofen have been shown to be safe and effective in relieving the symptoms of a sore throat (including pain).–Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges are available over-the-counter in many countries, and they are the only formulation of flurbiprofen currently available in Russia. However, an innovative spray formulation containing flurbiprofen 8.75 mg has recently been developed to provide patients with another treatment option for the relief of sore throat symptoms. In the first safety and efficacy study of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray, treatment was well tolerated, and rapid, long-lasting relief from sore throat pain and other symptoms was observed.

The primary objective of this randomized, non-inferiority study was to assess the efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to URTI. Treatment was assessed in the overall population and in subgroups of patients who tested positive or negative for beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C).

### Effects of acetylsalicylic acid on sore throat pain and other pain symptoms associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection [^115u3VQ3]. Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been widely used for over a century to treat pain and fever associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), but there is a lack of clinical data to support the efficacy of ASA in this disease state. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of ASA for the treatment of sore throat pain associated with URTI.

Design

A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. Two hundred seventy-two patients (mean age: 25 years) with sore throat pain associated with URTI were recruited at two centers. Pain scores were made during a 2-hour laboratory phase and continued for secondary objectives during a 4-hour home phase. Patients were treated with either two effervescent tablets of ASA 400 mg in water or matched placebo tablets. Patients took medication as required over a 3-day home phase.

Results

ASA was found to be superior to placebo for: The primary efficacy parameter predefined in the protocol, reduction in sore throat pain intensity over 2 hours (P < 0.001), and for secondary efficacy parameters, reduction in sore throat pain intensity over 4 and 6 hours, relief of sore throat pain over 2, 4, and 6 hours, reduction in intensity of pain associated with headache, and reduction in muscle aches and pains over a 2-hour time period (P < 0.01). No safety problems were encountered.

Conclusions

Treatment with ASA was shown to provide relief from sore throat pain, headache, and muscle aches and pains associated with URTI.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2023–2024 [^116cH3jr]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2023–2024 influenza season. A detailed review of the evidence supporting these recommendations is published in the accompanying technical report (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2023-063773). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age. Children are at risk for hospitalization and death from influenza. Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community, as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses are cocirculating. Any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be administered, ideally as soon as possible in the season, without preference for one product or formulation over another. Antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended for children with suspected (eg, influenza-like illness [fever with either cough or sore throat]) or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized, have severe or progressive disease, or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza, regardless of duration of illness. Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Antiviral treatment may be considered in the outpatient setting for symptomatic children with suspected or confirmed influenza disease who are not at high risk for influenza complications, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment may also be considered for children with suspected or confirmed influenza disease whose siblings or household contacts either are younger than 6 months or have a high-risk condition that predisposes them to complications of influenza. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of influenza virus infection as an adjunct to vaccination in certain individuals, especially exposed children who are at high risk for influenza complications but have not yet been immunized or those who are not expected to mount an effective immune response.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11465RgX]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Complete resolution of pain at 24 or 48 hours

In a pooled analysis of four trials w1 w2 w6 w7 patients treated with corticosteroids were three times more likely to have complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1, P < 0.001, I² = 44%) (fig 2). The number needed to treat was 3.7 (2.8 to 5.9). Significant effects were recorded in adult patients only (relative risk 4.3, 2.3 to 8.1, P < 0.001) w1 w6 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (2.6, 1.6 to 4.3, P < 0.001). w1 w2 w6 Data were insufficient to undertake further subgroup analysis.

Fig 2 Effect of corticosteroids on number of patients experiencing complete pain relief at 24 and 48 hours. See web appendix for references

In three trials w1 w2 w7 corticosteroids also increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours (relative risk 1.7, 95%CI 1.3 to 2.1, P < 0.001), number needed to treat was 3.3 (2.4 to 5.6) (fig 2). Results were similar in trials with adult patients only (1.8, 1.3 to 2.3, P < 0.001) w1 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (1.6, 1.2 to 2.1, P = 0.004). w1 w2

Mean time to onset of pain relief

Six trials reported the mean time to onset of pain relief, which occurred at an average of 6.3 hours earlier with corticosteroids than without (95% CI 9.3 to 3.4, P < 0.001) (fig 3). w3-w8 The wide variation in individual response times caused high heterogeneity (I² = 73%). A sensitivity analysis, which excluded each trial in turn, demonstrated a range of weighted mean difference of 5.1 to 7.2 hours, but no loss of significance. The majority of the heterogeneity arose from the trial by Tasar et al, which showed the largest benefit of corticosteroids with small standard deviations. w7 Removal of this trial from the meta-analysis gave a mean time to onset of pain relief 5.1 hours earlier in patients given corticosteroids.

### Lidocaine for preventing postoperative sore throat [^114M9Tbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common side-effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30% and 70% of patients after tracheal intubation. The likelihood of a sore throat varies with the type, diameter, and cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube used. If intubation is essential, it may be helpful to give drugs prophylactically to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2015.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and any harm caused by topical and systemic lidocaine used prophylactically to prevent postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2013), and EMBASE (1980 to October 2013). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The original search was undertaken in June 2007. We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of topical and systemic prophylactic lidocaine therapy versus control (using air or saline) that reported on the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information, such as the risk of any adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving 1940 participants in this updated review. Of those 1940 participants, 952 received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 795 were allocated to the control groups. Topical and systemic lidocaine therapy appeared to reduce the risk of postoperative sore throat (16 studies, 1774 participants, risk ratio (RR) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85), the quality of the evidence was low), although when only high-quality trials were included (eight studies, 814 participants) the effect was no longer significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09). Lidocaine given systemically in two studies (320 participants) did not reveal evidence of an effect (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.05). The severity of sore throat as measured on a visual-analogue scale (VAS) was reduced by lidocaine therapy (six trials, 611 participants, (mean difference (MD) -10.80, 95% CI -14.63 to -6.98). The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies, though toxicity is generally rare.

Authors' Conclusions

In our revised systematic review, although the results of included studies show generally positive results, they should be interpreted carefully. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by study quality; drug concentration; route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^113gvqDx]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Plain language summary

A sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection such as cold or flu, which results in pain and inflammation. This clinical study was done to test how effective the anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen, relieves sore throat when it is provided as a throat spray or a lozenge. The study patients had moderate or severe sore throat caused by an infection. They were given a single dose of the drug provided as either a throat spray or lozenge, and then their throat pain was measured for the next 2 hours. The study found that both spray and lozenge were effective for reducing throat pain, with no difference seen between them. The study also showed that the spray and lozenge were both effective in the small number of patients with "Strep throat" (a bacterial infection that may need antibiotics). Side effects were similar for both spray and lozenge and none were serious. This study showed that flurbiprofen throat spray and flurbiprofen lozenge are both effective for sore throat, giving patients a choice of treatment, depending on their preference.

### Postoperative sore throat: a systematic review [^116JmbtN]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative sore throat is a common complaint with an incidence of up to 62%. While anaesthetists often perceive this as a minor and self-limiting complication, postoperative sore throat is one of the leading causes of postoperative anaesthesia-related discomfort. Preventative strategies for postoperative sore throat have been studied extensively, but well-evidenced recommendations are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to summarise interventions which may prevent postoperative sore throat. Two independent reviewers assessed studies against inclusion criteria and completed a Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 assessment for randomised controlled trials. The results were synthesised narratively due to extensive methodological heterogeneity (populations, interventions and outcomes).

Results

We identified 1883 studies, of which 162 met the inclusion criteria (enrolling 21,199 patients). The pooled incidence of postoperative sore throat at 1h was 32.4% (95%CI 26.9–38.5%) in 43 studies involving tracheal intubation and 29.4% (95%CI 20.5–40.2%) in 18 studies that used a supraglottic airway device. At 24h, the pooled incidence of postoperative sore throat was 16.4% (95%CI 13.6–19.8%) in 93 studies involving tracheal intubation and 9.9% (95%CI 6.7–14.4%) in 23 studies that used supraglottic airway devices. Interventions with evidence of benefit included maintaining cuff pressure ≤ 60cmH₂O for supraglottic airway devices and ≤ 30cmH₂O for tracheal tubes. For tracheal tubes only, other interventions with benefit included use of topical ketamine; intravenous or topical steroids; and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Discussion

Despite the high incidence of postoperative sore throat, the current literature lacks high-quality randomised controlled trials on treatments that prevent a complication that is of importance to patients and their recovery. New research will only add value to this area if studies adequately control for confounders.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Tonsillectomy: a cost-effective option for childhood sore throat? Further analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^117J7fHP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the estimated cost-effectiveness of childhood (adeno)tonsillectomy vs medical therapy for recurrent sore throats from the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with that modeled on the recorded timing of surgical interventions as observed in all participants irrespective of their original group allocation.

Study Design

A pragmatic RCT (trial) with a parallel nonrandomized patient preference group (cohort) of (adeno)tonsillectomy vs medical therapy.

Setting

Five secondary care UK otolaryngology departments.

Subjects and Methods

Eligible children, aged 4 to 15 years, were enrolled to the trial (268) or cohort (461) groups. Outcomes included sore throat diaries, quality of life, and general practice consultations. The RCT protocol ITT analysis was compared with an as-treated analysis incorporating the cohort group, modeled to reflect the timing of tonsillectomy and the differential switch rates among the original groups.

Results

In the RCT ITT analysis, tonsillectomy saved 3.5 sore throats, whereas the as-treated model suggested an average reduction of more than 8 sore throats in 2 years for surgery within 10 weeks of consultation, falling to only 3.5 twelve months later due to the spontaneous improvement in the medical therapy group.

Conclusion

In eligible UK school-age children, tonsillectomy can save up to 8 sore throats at a reasonable cost, if performed promptly. Further prospective data collection, accounting for baseline and per-trial preferences and choice, is urgently needed.

### Postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: an updated narrative review and call for action [^117Se5wM]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative sore throat (POST) represents a common airway complication closely related to endotracheal tube (ETT), exhibiting a higher incidence following tracheal intubation compared to other airway apparatuses. Nevertheless, considering its mild and self-limiting character, POST is often overlooked. This study provides an updated narrative review on the latest perspectives regarding POST, including a comprehensive summary of its mechanisms, risk factors, clinical assessment methods, prevention and treatment strategies. Additionally, directions for future research are proposed.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted using keywords such as "postoperative sore throat" and "tracheal intubation" in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from their inception to October 2024. Two groups of reviewers independently performed data search and cleaning after standard training. To address gaps in knowledge or potential biases, the literature was thoroughly screened based on established criteria, and a comprehensive synthesis, analysis, and summary of the relevant findings was conducted.

Results

The precise cause of POST remains unknown, and its potential mechanism is believed to involve secondary inflammation triggered by irritation, mechanical trauma, tracheal intubation, and cuff inflation. The risk factors for POST encompass preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. Currently, effective prevention methods for POST consist of pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological interventions, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy. In terms of pharmacological interventions, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid can effectively prevent the occurrence of POST through their anti-inflammatory properties. However, given the unavoidable side effects of medications, non-pharmacological interventions and non-invasive methods may offer greater benefits for POST and related hoarseness. For example, proficient and gentle intubation techniques can prevent mechanical injury caused by repeated intubation attempts. Currently, several studies have demonstrated the potential role of TCM in managing POST. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying its effects remain to be elucidated, and the available clinical evidence is still limited.

Conclusion

Given that POST is prevalent following tracheal intubation but frequently overlooked, we advocate heightened awareness of its occurrence and progression, and recommend integrating the prevention and management of POST into routine clinical practice.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112b54AB]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Fig 3 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief in hours. See web appendix for references

In patients with an exudative sore throat, corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief (weighted mean difference 6.2 hours, 8.4 to 4.0). Similarly, we recorded a reduction in mean time to pain relief in sore throat that was bacterial pathogen positive (5.3, 8.0 to −2.6) and in trials selecting for severe sore throat (7.2, 10.1 to 4.3). All three categories of sore throat (exudative, bacterial pathogen positive, and severe) were significant (P < 0.001) with no heterogeneity (I² = 0) (fig 4).

Fig 4 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief analysed by subgroup using meta-regression. PO = oral delivery. IM = intramuscular delivery

The direction of effect for mean time to onset of pain relief was similar in trials with adults only, in trials with intramuscular and oral routes of steroid administration, and in trials in which severe sore throat was not selected. The effect on children only, those with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and non-bacterial pathogen positive only did not reach significance. We did not find significant changes in mean time to onset of pain relief in trials with children only, trials with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and in the subgroup of patients with sore throat not positive for bacterial pathogens. Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant differences across all subgroups (fig 4).

Figure 5shows the change in visual analogue scale at baseline to 72 hours. The data from Bulloch et al's trial display the lowest baseline visual analogue scale score (that is, less severe) and the least response at 24 and 48 hours. w3 This finding is reflected in the non-significant effect (and the smallest effect) observed in the mean time to onset of pain relief for this trial.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^112batVD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of individuals self-administer over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold products to combat the common cold. Pharmacologic interventions to treat the common cold include analgesics, antihistamines, decongestants, and a combination of these medications. These treatments aim to alleviate the symptoms of a common cold, and several studies have demonstrated the (partial) efficacy of these products. However, the disadvantage of these products is that they reduce only some but not all of the symptoms of the common cold. For instance, acetaminophen (paracetamol) may improve nasal obstruction and runny nose, but it shows no significant improvement in other symptoms, such as sore throat, coughing or general malaise. Other popular treatments include vitamin supplements, herbal products, and honey. However, review studies have revealed only low- to moderate-quality evidence to support the efficacy of these products in reducing severity, with no impact on duration of the common cold episode. Alternatively, zinc supplementation did not reduce the severity of the common cold episode, although it has been shown to reduce the duration of a common cold episode. However, the use of zinc may be associated with bad taste and nausea. Therefore, individuals who want to use zinc should weigh the benefit of a potential shortening of the common cold episode against the risk of these unwanted side effects. Finally, a Cochrane review concluded that use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold was not effective. Taken together, the data indicate that currently, there is no treatment available for which scientific research has demonstrated ability to reduce both the severity and the duration of a common cold episode.

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information, such as the risk of adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 1232 patients from 15 studies; 672 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 560 patients were allocated to the control group. Both the topical and systemic lidocaine therapy significantly reduced the risk of postoperative sore throat (risk ratio (RR) 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.82). To evaluate the severity of sore throat on a visual analogue scale (VAS), 219 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 152 patients were allocated to the control groups. The severity of sore throat was reduced (mean difference (MD) -11.9; 95% CI -16.44 to -7.32), an effect that neared statistical significance. The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review establishes the effectiveness of topical and systemic lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat resulting from intubation. The risk and severity of postoperative sore throat tended to be reduced. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by drug concentration and route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bX98N]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

Study characteristics

Of 3257 potentially relevant records identified, 26 were relevant to sore throat, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis (fig 1). A further 17 studies were excluded because they examined postoperative or postintubation sore throat (13 studies), included inpatients (one), did not have a placebo group (one), or were duplicate publications (two). Of the nine that met our inclusion criteria, one was excluded for not describing the method of randomisation.

Fig 1 Flowchart of search results

The eight studies included 743 patients (369 children, 374 adults): 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. Patients were recruited from emergency department and general practice settings in four countries: United States (five studies), Canada (one), Israel (one), and Turkey (one) (table 1). Corticosteroids used included betamethasone 2 mL (estimated dose 8 mg, one study), dexamethasone (up to 10 mg, six studies; or prednisone 60 mg, one study): doses were reasonably comparable for their potency. Corticosteroids were administered either intramuscularly (three studies), orally (four), or both (one). Six trials used one dose of corticosteroids, and two trials prescribed more than one dose of corticosteroids to a subgroup of participants. w1 w2 In the eight included studies, methodological quality was high with a low risk of bias (for example, all trials reported adequate allocation concealment and clear methods of randomisation). Table 2reports the specific elements of methodological quality in the selected studies.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^116KRCpC]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Sensation of Swollen Throat

Eleven of the papers reported data evaluating the efficacy of flurbiprofen in reducing the sensation of swollen throat (Table 5), commonly assessed on the Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS; Table 2). As with the other symptoms associated with sore throat, the data generally support that flurbiprofen is effective at reducing the sensation of swollen throat rapidly after a single dose – with significantly greater reductions observed from 30 min to up to 6 h post-dose,– and after multiple dosing over 1–7 days. Notably, Aspley et alobserved a 69.3% greater reduction in sensation of swollen throat with multiple-dose flurbiprofen lozenges compared with placebo over 24 h (p < 0.05), and an even greater reduction (148.6%) in patients who had relatively severe symptoms (baseline SwoTS score > 81.5 mm). Only one study reported no difference between single-dose flurbiprofen and placebo in reduction of sensation of swollen throat over 2 and 6 h, but did report significant reductions in the symptom on days 3 (p = 0.005) and 4 (p = 0.001) of multiple dosing.

Onset of Action

Several studies indicated that locally administered flurbiprofen can provide symptomatic relief from sore throat and associated symptoms from 1–30 min after taking a single dose, depending on the first assessment time point (Table 6). Burova et alreported that at least 90% of patients using single-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray or lozenge experienced at least "slight" sore throat relief (on the STRRS) from 1 min post completion of dose, with 55–59% of patients reporting "at least moderate relief" – an established measure of clinically meaningful effect – from 1 min. Similarly, Russo et alreported a significantly greater reduction in mean throat soreness with flurbiprofen 8.75 mg microgranules (p < 0.001) and a significantly greater improvement in sore throat relief (p < 0.0006) compared with placebo at 1 min post-dose.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^117VDjyz]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The purpose of the Finnish Current Care Guidelines is to provide evidence-based treatment guidelines to help standardize nationwide treatment protocols. After publishing the updated guideline, a taskforce released a media briefing and news article in the Finnish Medical Library Handbook and on the Duodecim website and social media accounts, in addition to announcements in medical conventions, professional development days, and specialty societies. Based on the results of this study, these measures are insufficient to impact the diagnostic protocols of acute pharyngitis. Our results, as well as reports from other countries, show that the mere publication of guidelines will not immediately change previous practices, and thus implementation is necessary. An interview of Swedish GPs showed that guideline adherence was low especially if recommendation in the guidelines was not compatible with existing norms and preconceptions of the physicians. Recent study showed that there is considerable mishandling of acute pharyngitis in Italian ERs. A Finnish study that assessed whether published guidelines against the use of cough medication had an impact on prescriptions initially found that it did not. However, the study group reported that after implementing a program with practical guidance for prescribing, the prescription rates reduced.

Educating general practitioners alone may not be sufficient to change the use of rapid antigen and CRP tests in patients with sore throat. In general, patients who come to the emergency department or make acute visits to primary care facilities first see a nurse, and depending on regional instructions, nurses administer tests at their own discretion. Thus, local protocols for testing such common infections are needed to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and costs.

### Improvements in throat function and qualities of sore throat from locally applied flurbiprofen 8.75 mg in spray or lozenge format: findings from a randomized trial of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the Russian Federation [^115shuxa]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Only a minority of patients in this study had a definitive diagnosis of Strep A or C infection, as confirmed by throat swab culture results (6.5% and 4.3% of patients from the flurbiprofen spray and lozenge groups, respectively). By comparison, the results of the CAST show that physicians often overestimated the incidence of Strep, with 18.0% of patients across both treatment groups considered "likely" or "very likely" to have Strep infection and would likely have been prescribed antibiotics inappropriately. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the CAST were modest. Therefore, these findings highlight the difficulty of accurately diagnosing Strep A infection on the basis of clinical features alone. Furthermore, the throat swab results from the current study confirm that most patients would not have benefitted from antibiotics, and that effective topical medications are a more appropriate choice for the large majority of patients with acute ST due to URTI (those patients with more severe symptoms were ineligible for inclusion in the study). The results of the current and previous studiesdemonstrate that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg is an effective therapeutic option for rapid and long-lasting ST relief in patients both with and without Strep A or C infection and can be added to antibiotics when they are indicated to provide symptomatic relief.

### Improving antimicrobial prescribing practice for sore throat symptoms in a general practice setting [^11749bsW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to health both at population and individual patient levels. A key driver of increasing resistance to antibiotics is their overuse worldwide.

The highest rates of antibiotic prescription in the UK takes place in general practice and most are for common respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as sore throat. General practice is also where most antibiotic treatment failures for RTIs, due to resistance and adverse side effects, increasingly occur.

Sore throat symptoms is one of the most common presentations in general practice worldwide, ranging from 2–4 percent. Most are due to viral infections and 90% resolve in 7 days without antibiotics. Antibiotic use has modest benefit in shortening the duration of illness with pain only reduced by 16 hours. Although antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of very rare complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis such as rheumatic fever, otitis media, acute sinusitis and quinsythe number needed to treat to prevent these complications is very high. Furthermore, in clinical practice it is difficult to determine the bacterial aetiology of sore throat symptoms. Therefore, the current guidelines from NICE and PHE in the UK recommend antibiotic use should be avoided for sore throat symptoms. The guidelines further recommend that clinical assessment based on the four Centor criteria (Lymphadenopathy; No Cough; Fever; Tonsillar Exudate)should be used to decide antibiotic prescription. For Centor score three or four, 2 or 3-day delayed or immediate antibiotic prescription could be considered. Guidelines also state the parameters of antibiotic prescribing: antibiotic choice, dose, frequency and duration. The recommendation of the duration of antibiotic use is based on Randomised Control Trial (RCT) in < 18 year olds, that shows 10 days phenoxymethylpenicillin course had lower relapse rates. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is more likely if patients received longer duration, incomplete courses and broad spectrum antibiotics such as clarithromycin. Therefore, the guidelines recommend that phenoxymethypenicillin should be used as treatment of choice and a short course of clarithromycin must be reserved for those with true penicillin allergy.

Antibiotic guidelines have introduced evidence-based recommendations to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescription in general practice. Thus, improving compliance with national policies will reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs, it will also contribute to better patient care by reducing antibiotic-associated adverse side effects.

### Improvements in throat function and qualities of sore throat from locally applied flurbiprofen 8.75 mg in spray or lozenge format: findings from a randomized trial of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the Russian Federation [^116SrcYC]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat (ST) is a symptom of pharyngeal inflammation, that often results from an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Patients reporting to the primary care for ST often complain of odynophagia, throat swelling, and dysphagia; however, beyond these complaints, patients may report a broad range of other sensory, functional, and affective qualities of ST pain.–These qualities include burning, rawness, dryness, an irritated/scratchy/tickly sensation, tightness, the feeling of having a lump in the throat, a husky/hoarse voice, and agonizing pain. Some of these ST qualities are rated by patients as more painful than others; for example, a dry or scratchy, tickly, and itchy throat is associated with less pain and discomfort than a swollen, tight throat, and stabbing, sharp pain. The wide variety of different patient-reported ST qualities reflects a number of factors, including the probable cause of ST, such as URTI, the individual's immune response and pain thresholds, and social and environmental influences.

The availability of effective symptomatic relief is an important factor in meeting patients' needs and avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics, which are frequently inappropriate for ST and do not provide relief from painful symptoms. Medicinal format is a driver of patient choiceand, particularly for ST, different formats can provide different experiences–with local treatments often containing a lower dose of active ingredient than systemic analgesics, and may therefore be associated with a reduced risk of adverse events.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug flurbiprofen is one of the very few examples available of a locally delivered, traditional analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. Lozenges containing a low dose of 8.75 mg flurbiprofen have a good safety profile and are proven to be effective in relieving various characteristics of ST. However, the recently developed, innovative spray formulation containing the same low flurbiprofen dose of 8.75 mg provides patients with ST with another treatment option.

Throat Pain and Soreness

Overall, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg generally provided significant relief of sore throat pain and soreness compared with placebo (Table 3), as measured on the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS), Sore Throat Relief Rating Scale (STRRS), Throat Soreness Scale (TSS) and Sore Throat Scale (STS) (Table 2).

Table 3
Summary of Studies Reporting Throat Pain and Soreness Outcomes a

Single Dose

Fourteen papers reported data on the effectiveness of single-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for relieving throat pain and soreness;. 11 included data for flurbiprofen lozenges, four for flurbiprofen spray and one for flurbiprofen microgranules. In a study by Schachtel et al, single-dose flurbiprofen lozenge demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (85%) in sore throat pain intensity summed over the 2 h post-dose period (as measured on the STPIS) compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Moreover, in another study by Schachtel et al, almost all (97%) patients treated with a single flurbiprofen lozenge experienced a reduction in sore throat pain intensity over the 3 h post-dose period (vs 76% of placebo-treated patients; p < 0.01). Several other papers also reported significantly greater reductions in sore throat pain intensity compared with placebo with single-dose flurbiprofen lozenge, spray, and microgranulesfor up to 3–6 h post-dose (specific percentage reductions were not provided). Regarding absolute/percentage reductions in sore throat pain intensity/soreness from baseline, significantly greater reductions were observed with flurbiprofen vs placebo at all individual timepoints up to 2–4 h in several studies. Radkova et alobserved an STPIS pain intensity difference from baseline to 2 h post-dose of −40.51 and −40.10 with flurbiprofen spray and lozenges, respectively. No significant difference was observed between single-dose flurbiprofen spray and lozenge in terms of improvement in sore throat pain intensity.

### Acetaminophen (paracetamol) for the common cold in adults [^113JjAh6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen is frequently prescribed for treating patients with the common cold, but there is little evidence as to whether it is effective.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen in the treatment of the common cold in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 1, Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to January week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013) and LILACS (1985 to February 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acetaminophen to placebo or no treatment in adults with the common cold. Studies were included if the trials used acetaminophen as one ingredient of a combination therapy. We excluded studies in which the participants had complications. Primary outcomes included subjective symptom score and duration of common cold symptoms. Secondary outcomes were overall well being, adverse events and financial costs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed standard statistical analyses.

Main Results

We included four RCTs involving 758 participants. We did not pool data because of heterogeneity in study designs, outcomes and time points. The studies provided sparse information about effects longer than a few hours, as three of four included studies were short trials of only four to six hours. Participants treated with acetaminophen had significant improvements in nasal obstruction in two of the four studies. One study showed that acetaminophen was superior to placebo in decreasing rhinorrhoea severity, but was not superior for treating sneezing and coughing. Acetaminophen did not improve sore throat or malaise in two of the four studies. Results were inconsistent for some symptoms. Two studies showed that headache and achiness improved more in the acetaminophen group than in the placebo group, while one study showed no difference between the acetaminophen and placebo group. None of the included studies reported the duration of common cold symptoms. Minor side effects (including gastrointestinal adverse events, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence and increased sweating) in the acetaminophen group were reported in two of the four studies. One of them used a combination of pseudoephedrine and acetaminophen.

Authors' Conclusions

Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea but does not appear to improve some other cold symptoms (including sore throat, malaise, sneezing and cough). However, two of the four included studies in this review were small and allocation concealment was unclear in all four studies. The data in this review do not provide sufficient evidence to inform practice regarding the use of acetaminophen for the common cold in adults. Further large-scale, well-designed trials are needed to determine whether this intervention is beneficial in the treatment of adults with the common cold.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^115BbJUV]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Sample size

This study tested the hypothesis that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray is not worse than flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges in the treatment of patients with sore throat due to URTI. Based on data from previous studies of flurbiprofen lozenges, the non-inferiority margin of −6 mm was selected. Assuming that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray would be at least as efficacious as flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges in reducing sore throat pain intensity at 2 hours post-dose with the non-inferiority margin of −6 mm and assuming no actual difference between groups, a pooled standard deviation of 19.1 mm, a ratio of 1:1 in treatment group allocation, a 2.5% chance for type I error, and a 2.5% dropout rate over the first 2 hours of the study, 220 patients per treatment group were required to ensure 90% power.

Primary and secondary end points

The primary efficacy end point was the difference from baseline to 2 hours post-dose in sore throat pain intensity scale (STPIS pain intensity difference [PID] 2h). The main secondary end points were difference from baseline in sore throat pain intensity at 1 hour (STPIS PID 1h), the sum of sore throat pain intensity differences (SPID) over 2 hours (STPIS SPID 0–2h), and change from baseline in sore throat pain intensity (STPIS) in patients with and without beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C) infection. Scoring on both the Patient Satisfaction Scale and the CLIN at 2 hours post-dose was also compared between the treatment groups.

### Differences among international pharyngitis guidelines: not just academic [^116HrY17]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many countries have national guidelines for the treatment of pharyngitis. We wanted to compare the recommendations and the reported evidence in national guidelines for the management of acute sore throat in adults.

Methods

Guidelines were retrieved via MEDLINE and EMBASE and through a Web-based search for guideline development organizations. The content of the recommendations and the underlying evidence were analyzed with qualitative and bibliometric methods.

Results

We included 4 North American and 6 European guidelines. Recommendations differ with regard to the use of a rapid antigen test and throat culture and with the indication for antibiotics. The North American, French, and Finnish guidelines consider diagnosis of group A streptococcus essential, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever remains an important reason to prescribe antibiotics. In 4 of the 6 European guidelines, acute sore throat is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not recommended. The evidence used to underpin these guidelines was different in North America and Europe. North American guidelines cited more North American references than did European guidelines (87.2% vs 48.0%; ods ratio, 4.6–11.9; P < .001).

Conclusion

Although the evidence for the management of acute sore throat is easily available, national guidelines are different with regard to the choice of evidence and the interpretation for clinical practice. Also a transparent and standardized guideline development method is lacking. These findings are important in the context of appropriate antibiotic use, the problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, and costs for the community.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: policy statement [^1159cRrs]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccines and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2024–2025 influenza season. A detailed review of the evidence supporting these recommendations is published in the accompanying technical report (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-068508). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age. Children are at risk for hospitalization and death from influenza. Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses are cocirculating. Any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be administered, ideally as soon as possible in the season, without preference for one product or formulation over another. All licensed influenza vaccines for use in the United States are trivalent for the 2024–2025 influenza season. Antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended for children with suspected (eg, influenza-like illness [fever with either cough or sore throat]) or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized or have severe or progressive disease or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza, regardless of duration of illness. Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Antiviral treatment may be considered in the outpatient setting for symptomatic children who are not at high risk for influenza complications with suspected or confirmed influenza disease, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment may also be considered for children with suspected or confirmed influenza disease whose siblings or household contacts either are younger than 6 months or have a high-risk condition that predisposes them to complications of influenza. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of influenza virus infection as an adjunct to vaccination in certain individuals, especially exposed children who are asymptomatic and are at high risk for influenza complications but have not yet been immunized or those who are not expected to mount an effective immune response.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^1145Jsss]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020. Soon afterwards (on March 11, 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic. It has been estimated that around 35% of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations include fever, cough, body aches and pains, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal symptoms, acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, and loss of smell or taste –. Symptoms range in severity from mild to extremely severe, and patients with severe symptoms may require hospitalization and ventilation. In July 2021, the total number of global deaths related to COVID-19 had almost reached 4 million. Global data on hospitalization rates are lacking but, in the USA between February 2020 and March 2021, there were an estimated 97.1 million symptomatic illnesses and 5.6 million hospitalizations related to COVID-19. In the early stages of the pandemic, best practice for managing hospitalized patients was undefined. Since then, treatment guidelines have been developed that include recommendations on the use of medications known to be beneficial –.

### Comparative efficacy of 6 topical pharmacological agents for preventive interventions of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11692Zxs]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

The full manuscripts of publications meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by 2 investigators (G.W. and Y.Q.), and the relevant data were extracted into an electronic database, including trial information (ie, author, publication year, sample size, types of intervention, and control), population characteristics (ie, sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status), study characteristics (ie, country, ETT size, and surgery type), study intervention, that is, drug administration data (ie, dosage, time, and mode of application), reported outcomes (including POST risk after surgery/extubation at the following time intervals: 0–1, 2–3, 4–6, and 24 hours), and information on methodology. Disagreements between the 2 reviewers were resolved by consensus and, if necessary, by consultation with a third reviewer (L.W.).

Quality Assessment

The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool was used by 2 reviewers to independently assess the quality of the included studies. The ROB tool includes randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. In addition, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate, which characterizes the quality of the evidence on the basis of the study limitations, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias for the primary outcomes.

Outcomes

The risk of POST after surgery/extubation was the primary outcome of this study. As there is no established definition of POST, the definition used by each study was accepted. Most studies utilized a 4-level classification system (ie, none, mild, moderate, or severe) and a 4-point scale (0–3) for postoperative soreness to categorize the presence and the severity of POST. The sum of severe, moderate, and mild cases was used to calculate the risk of POST. As different time intervals were used for the POST assessment, we recategorized the outcomes into 4 subgroups: 0 to 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 6, and 24 hours.
